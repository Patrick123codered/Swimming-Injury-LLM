ABSTRACT 
Objective: To study the nature and incidence rate of injuries that affect collegiate 
competitive swimmers and to examine the relationship between these injuries and 
specific risk factors. 
Background: Minimal research has been conducted on swimming-related 
injuries, with most studies being retrospective in nature. Only one study reported a 
calculated injury rate for athletic exposures. Past research reports that the shoulder is the 
most commonly injured location and that overuse injuries (e.g. tendonitis) is the most 
common injury type. 
Methods: IRB approval obtained through the University of North Dakota. 
Swimmers from UND swim team were asked to participate. Once consent was obtained, 
baseline data in the form of participant information and a medical history questionnaire 
was gathered for each participant. Afterwards, the swimmers were followed for an entire 
season to report any injuries and their exposure to swimming (attendance records, 
yardage, etc.). Once the season was over, descriptive and analytical data analyses were 
completed based off information obtained from the participants. 
Results: Of the 34 participants, 20 sustained a total of 31 injuries during the study 
period. Based on data found injury rates were calculated has being 5.55 injuries per 1000 
AE's and 3.04 injuries per 1000 hours training. Risk factors included in this study wer~ 
gender, years swimming competitively, history of any injury, and history of specific 
vm 
injury. Risk factors that remained significant in the multivariate analysis were history of 
any injury and history of specific injury. 
Conclusions: Injury rates reported in this study are higher than injury rates 
reported by pervious swim-related studies. When compared to other overhead sports, 
swimming has a lower overall injury rate. As for distribution of injuries, the data reported 
in this study are similar to those that were reported in other swim-related studies.

CHAPTER I 
INTRODUCTION 
In 2008, USA Swimming reported 257,163 swimmers participating in their 
numerous swimming clubs throughout the country (USAswimming.org). Additionally, 
during the 2005-2006 season, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) 
reported 18,782 student-athletes participating in collegiate swimming (NCAA.org). 
These participation numbers demonstrate the increased popularity of competitive 
swimming in the United States. Many researchers believe this is due to the fact that 
swimming gives the participants both an upper and lower body workout and also 
improves cardiovascular fitness (Fowler & Regan, 1986). Competitive swimming is 
different from its recreational counterpart in the sense that the swimmer is training and 
competing in numerous events throughout the season. Competitive swimming consists of 
four different swim strokes: butterfly, breaststroke, backstroke and free style. 
Competitive swimming was first introduced as an Olympic sport in the summer of 
1896 (McMaster, 1996) in which three events were held (underwater swimming, 200m 
obstacle swimming and plunge for distance) and were designed for men only. Women 
were not allowed to participate in the Olympic Games until 1912. Unfortunately, there 
were no rules or regulations specifically assigned to swimming during the first Olympic 
games. However, in 1908 a world-wide swimming association was formed to identify_ 
universal rules and regulations associated with competitive swimming. The first 
swimming association included representatives from eight European countries including 
1 
Germany, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Great Britain, Hungary and Sweden 
(www.olympic.org). In 1937 competitive swimming became classified as an official sport 
of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). Today competitive swimming is 
one of several sports offered to student-athletes at division I, II, and III colleges and 
universities in the United States. According to the NCAA, 509 schools sponsored 
women's competitive swim teams and 389 schools sponsored men's competitive swim 
teams during the 2007-2008 season, totaling 19,620 student-athletes (NCAA sports 
sponsorship and participation rates, 2009). 
The majority of competitive swimmers begin competing between five and six 
years of age (Jones, 1999). Depending on the swimmers age and level of participation, 
training and competing can run 10 to 11 months each year. Collegiate competitive 
swimmers can train between 8,000 and 20,000 yards daily and an average of20 to 30 
hours a week (Johnson et al., 1987). In addition to water based training, collegiate 
competitive swimmers are also required to participate in weight training regimens 
(Kammer et al., 1999). Typically, competitive swimmers compete in 10 minor 
competitions and 2 major competitions throughout the year (Grote, Lincoln, & Gamble, 
2004). Overall, the majority of competitive swimmers have a career life span between 10-
15 years (Johnson et al., 1978). 
Given the intensive and long-term training regimens of many competitive 
swimmers, concern has been raised regarding the incidence and severity of injury, 
particularly overuse injury affecting this population (Johnson et al., 1987). However, 
there have only been a handful of studies (Kennedy & Hawkins, 1974; Kennedy et al.,-
1978; Mutoh et al., 1988; Bak et al., 1989; Grimmer et al., 1996; McFarland & Wasik, 
1996; and Richardson, 1999) that have investigated the epidemiology of injury in 
2 
competitive swimming. In addition, many of the studies that have been conducted suffer 
from methodological short-comings which include the following: 
• The use of retrospective data collection which depends on memory 
recall and thus has the risk of "retrospective contamination". It has 
been shown that retrospectively collected data tend to miss the more 
minor injuries, thereby resulting in lower overall injury rates 
• Data sources are variable and range from self-report forms, athletic 
trainers and therapists, physicians, and injury registries 
• Populations were diverse with regards to level of competition, age, 
gender, coaching techniques, and training routines 
• Measurement bias associated with self-reporting of injuries 
• Participants were selected non-randomly or arose from convenience 
samples in most studies 
• Injury rates were reported primarily as clinical incidence (i.e., injuries 
per 100 participants) which does not account for the exposure of 
participants to risk factors 
• Little information on collegiate swimmers 
• Inconsistent injury definitions across studies 
In summary, competitive swimming is an extremely popular sport in the United 
States. This popularity is also evident in the numerous colleges and universities across the 
nation that sponsor competitive swimming. On average, collegiate competitive swimmers 
train about 10 to 11 months, swim 8,000 yards daily, and compete in 12 competitions 
throughout the year. Against this background, there is concern about the risk and severity 
3 
of injuries affecting collegiate swimmers. However, there is a lack of prospective 
epidemiological research which provides these data for competitive collegiate swimmers. 
Statement of the Problem 
This study will attempt to determine: (a) the nature and incidence rate of injuries 
that affect the University of North Dakota male and female competitive swimmers during 
the 2008-2009 season and (b) the relationship between injuries affecting collegiate 
competitive swimmers and the following potential risk factors: (i) gender, (ii) previous 
years of competitive swimming, and (iii) previous injuries. 
Definitions 
Injury 
An injury was defined as one that ( 1) occurred as a result of participation in 
organized swimming practice or competition, (2) resulted in restriction of the student 
athlete's participation or performance and/or (3) required the student athlete to seek 
medical attention by a Certified Athletic Trainer or team physician. This definition is a 
modified version of the definition used by the NCAA injury surveillance system (Dick, 
Agel, & Marshall, 2007). 
Exposure 
A) A time exposure: actual duration of training in hours 
B) An athlete-exposure (A-E) was defined as one swimmer participating in one 
practice or competition in which he or she was exposed to the possibility of athletic 
lll]Ury. 
Incidence Rate 
A) Total number of injuries per 1000 hours exposure 
B) Total number of injuries per 1000 athlete-exposures. 
4 
Time Loss 
Time loss was defined as the exact time (in days) between the original injury and 
the return to full practice/competition. Time loss was categorized as followed: <7 days 
(mild), 7-21 days (moderate), >21 days (severe). 
Limitations 
The first limitation identified in this study would be the sample chosen to 
participate. The sample is a convenience sample since the swimmers at the University of 
North Dakota were available to participate, accessible to the researcher, and Division I 
caliber athletes. This sample is not necessarily an exact representation of all competitive 
swimmers or swimmers within the NCAA organization in terms of age, level, experience, 
injury history, etc. However, they could be considered a representative of other Division I 
swimmers. Another limitation of this study is the length of this study. Ideally, an 
epidemiological study of sport injuries should be conducted over several years or seasons 
to ensure stability of data. 
Significance of Problem 
To date, there are only a few of epidemiological studies that have investigated the 
incidence rate and distribution of injuries affecting competitive, collegiate swimmers. In 
addition, there is only one study that has analyzed risk factors associated with the overall 
incidence of injury affecting swimmers. Unfortunately, these studies suffer from 
methodological limitations which limit the reliability and comparability of data. The poor 
quality of the existing research combined with the large population of swimmers exposed 
to the risk of injury underscores the need for this study. This study will be the first study 
that is prospectively designed to identify the extent of the injury problem and test risk 
factors related to injury in competitive, collegiate swimmers. The results of this study 
5 
,., 
will contribute to the research which describes the nature and incidence of injuries 
affecting competitive collegiate swimmers. Additionally, this research may help to 
identify injury risk factors which if controlled could help to reduce the risk and severity 
of injuries affecting swimmers.

CHAPTER II 
LITERATURE REVIEW 
Competitive swimming is defined as a non-contact sport that requires participants 
to be highly dedicated and maintain an extensive dry-land and water-based training 
regimen. On average, collegiate competitive swimmers train and compete 10 to 11 
months out of the year and participate in roughly 10 minor and 2 major competitions 
(Grote, Lincoln, & Gamble, 2004). A collegiate swimmer's training schedule can consist 
of swimming between 8,000 and 20,000 yards each day and an average of 20 to 30 hours 
a week (Johnson et al., 1987). In addition to water based training, collegiate competitive 
swimmers are also required to participate in weight training regimens that are designed to 
increase muscular strength and endurance (Kammer et al., 1999). This aggressive training 
and competition schedule wears on the body making the swimmers more susceptible to 
overuse injuries. This review will discuss the current published research on the 
epidemiology of competitive swimming injuries according to: who is affected by injury, 
where injury occurs, when injury occurs, outcome of injury, risk factors, inciting events, 
and prevention. 
Who is Affected by Injury? 
Table 1 summarizes the studies that reported injury rates in competitive 
swimming. Most of these studies reported the number of injuries sustained by the 
swimmers within the study. This allowed for the calculation of overall rates per 100 
participants, ranging from 4.5 to 194. 7 injuries per 100 participants. Unfortunately, these

rates are difficult to compare because they do not account for the varying exposure of 
swimmers to the risk of injury. There were several other factors which make cross-study 
comparisons difficult. First, the competitive level of swimmers varied among studies. 
Second, all but two studies were retrospective studies and were therefore subject to recall 
bias. Finally, these studies either did not define injury or the injury definition varied 
across studies. Only one study, McFarland and Wasik (1996), reported an overall 
exposure-based injury rate of 1.05 injuries per 1000 exposures from swimming. 
Where Does Injury Occur? 
Anatomical Location/Injury Type 
A summary of the distribution of injury by anatomical location is provided in 
table 2. This research indicates that the body part most affected by injury is the shoulder, 
ranging from 3% to 55% of all injuries (Richardson, 1999 & McFarland & Wasik, 1996), 
followed by the back (16% to 37%) (McFarland & Wasik, 1996 & Mutoh et al., 1988) 
then knee (5% to 28%) (Richardson, 1999 & Kennedy et al., 1978). In addition to studies 
identifying injuries to all anatomical locations, multiple studies have looked at specific 
anatomical injury locations. A summary of these studies is provided in table 3 and 
described below. An important shortcoming of most of these retrospective studies was 
that they depended on surveys therefore rendering them subject to recall bias. 
Shoulder Injuries 
Injuries to the shoulder complex are the most common musculoskeletal injuries 
that affect competitive swimmers and accounted for 3-55% of all injuries (table 2). The 
most frequently diagnosised shoulder injury is called "swimmer' s shoulder", which is -an 
impingement syndrome that occurs when either the supraspinatus muscle tendon, biceps 
brachii tendon or both become compressed by the acromion of the scapula making any

shoulder motion extremely painful and making swimming almost impossible (Johnson et 
al., 1987). Other shoulder injuries that can affect a swimmer include directional 
instability, glenohumeral labral injuries, brachia! plexus injuries, acromioclavicular joint 
pain, arthritis, and rotator cuff injuries (McMaster, 1999). 
As shown in table 3, five studies specifically studied the frequency of shoulder 
injuries in competitive swimming with rates ranging from 42.3 to 136.1 injuries per 100 
athletes. In one study, the majority (75%) of swimmers reported the most painful phases 
of the stroke were the 'pull through' and 'recovery' (Richardson et al., 1980). 
McMaster & Troup (1993) reported that the frequency of shoulder injury was 
related to the swimmer's competitive level. Their study of 993 competitive swimmers 
representing three competitive levels (national aged group, senior elite development 
group, and US national swimming team) revealed that the US National team swimmers 
had the highest percent of shoulder injuries (26%) compared to both the national aged 
level (10%) and the senior elite level (13%) swimmers. The US National team also had 
the highest percentage of shoulder injury history (73 % ) among the three groups 
(McMaster & Troup, 1993). 
Bak and Fauno (1997) performed complete physician examinations on 36 
swimmers with a history of shoulder injuries and found that 23 swimmers had a unilateral 
injury and 13 had bilateral injuries. Additionally, 39 of the 49 shoulders had a positive 
Hawkins' test, 19 had a positive Neer test, and 13 had a painful arc. Each of these 
positive tests indicates that the swimmer has some form of impingement syndrome 
however further dialogistic tests may need to be performed. Final clinical diagnoses for 
12 swimmers were classified as having a primary impingement and 25 swimmers were 
classified as having a secondary impingement. 
McMaster et al., (1998) studied 40 swimmers from the US Swimming Senior 
National Team. Fourteen swimmers (35%) indicated a current shoulder injury in the 
questionnaire. Nine of those swimmers expressed pain bilaterally and five had pain 
unilaterally (McMaster, Roberts, & Stoddard, 1998). 
Elbow Injuries 
It is believed that the two most common elbow injuries acquired by competitive 
swimmers are lateral epicondylitis (inflammation of the wrist extensor muscle group that 
attaches to the lateral epicondyle) and medial epicondylitis (inflammation of the muscles 
attached to the medial epicondyle) (Fowler & Regan, 1986). However, this literature 
search did not reveal any studies that looked specifically at the rate or type of elbow 
injuries in competitive swimming. 
Thigh (Adductor) Injuries 
As shown in table 2, thigh and adductor muscle strains have been reported to 
account for about 5% of all injuries sustained in competitive swimming (McFarland & 
Wasik, 1996 & Grimmer et al., 1996). Two studies (as shown in table 3) have specially 
reported on the frequency of thigh/adductor injuries. Loosli & Quick (1992) found that 10 
of 30 Division I swimmers had a history of or a present thigh injury. Their questionnaire 
indicated that the most common thigh injuries were defined as adductor magnus and/or 
brevis strains (Loosli & Quick, 1992). Grote et al. (2004) found that of the 296 swimmers 
who mainly participated in breaststroke (n=130), individual medley (n=80), or neither 
(n=86), those that were classified as breaststroke swimmers had a greater adductor strain 
prevalence (6.92%) than either of the two other groups (Grote et al., 2004). 
Knee Injuries 
13 
,. 
Knee injuries account for 5-28% of all swimming injuries (table 2). Four studies 
have looked specifically at knee injuries (Stulberg et al., 1980, Rovere & Nichols, 1985, 
Vizsolyl et al., 1987, & Hahn & Foldspang, 1998). One study (Fowler & Regan, 1986) 
identified "breaststroker' s knee" as the most common reported swimming related knee 
injury. Clinically, "breaststroker's knee" occurs when the swimmer's knee is placed in a 
maximal valgus position causing a medial collateral ligament sprain (Fowler & Regan, 
1986). Other injuries to the knee that were identified include patellar dislocation, general 
joint effusion, meniscus injuries, and medial synovitis (Fowler & Regan, 1986). 
Stulberg et al. (1980) found that of 23 breaststroke swimmers surveyed, 10 
identified a history of knee injuries relating to swimming. Further examination found 18 
swimmers with tenderness over the medial facet of the patella and five of them also had 
pain over the medial collateral ligament (Stulberg et al., 1980). Vizsolyi et al. (1987) 
found that 53% of the 391 swimmers in their study had a history of knee pain and 46% of 
the swimmers experienced most of the pain during the first part of their kick. Rovere & 
Nichols (1985) found that swimmers who had more frequent knee pain had a smaller 
degree of internal rotation of the tibia and a smaller Q angle than those who had 
occasional or no knee pain (Rovere & Nichols, 1985). 
Ankle Injuries 
Ankle and foot injuries account for 5.7-32.5% of all injuries sustained in 
competitive swimming (table 2). Ankle and foot injuries in competitive swimmers are 
believed to be caused by the repetitive kicking motions (Kennedy et al., 1978). The most 
common injuries to the ankle and foot are inflammation of the extensor retinaculum arid 
underlying extensor muscle tendons of the distal ankle (Kennedy et al., 1978). The 
literature search did not reveal any studies that looked specifically at the nature and 
incidence of ankle injuries in competitive swimming. 
Back Injuries 
Back injuries account for 11-37% (see table 2) of all injuries sustained as a result 
of participating in competitive swimming. Two studies look specifically at back injuries 
(see table 3). Back injuries range from minor to major injuries. Minor back injuries such 
as strains and spasms may force the swimmer to adjust their practice regimen by reducing 
their yardage and/or practicing with a completely different stroke. Major back injuries, 
such as spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis can significantly compromise the swimmer's 
ability to practice or compete and may also require corrective surgery (Kammer et al., 
1999). Soler et al. (2000) found the prevalence rate of spondolysis to be 10.23% among 
176 swimmers. This is almost twice the prevalence rate of the general population which 
is 6.0% (Verra et al., 2009). The literature search did not reveal any studies that looked at 
the incidence of back injuries in competitive swimming. 
Environmental Location 
There is a lack of research reporting on the environmental location of competitive 
swimming injuries. Swimming injuries not only occur in the swimming pool but in dry 
land training and other associated venues as well. Richardson (1999) found that of the 
886 injuries reported, 42% occurred in the water, 22% occurred on the pool deck, 7% 
occurred outside the pool, 6% in the locker room, 5% in the bleachers, and 3% off the 
blocks. McFarland and Wasik (1996) found that of the 125 injuries sustained by 68 
swimmers between the years of 1984 and 1991, 45% were swimming-related (both 
practice and competition) and 44% were related to cross-training. They also found that 
injury rates related to cross-training were very similar to injury rates obtained in 
15 
r 
swimming (1.07 injuries per 1000 exposures compared to 1.05 injuries per 1000 
exposures, respectively). 
When Does Injury Occur? 
Injury Onset 
It has been reported that the majority of swimming injuries are classified as 
overuse injuries (McMaster, 1996). However there is no research that reports on the 
relative proportions of overuse and acute injuries. 
Chronology 
There is very little research that investigates the timing of swimming-related 
injuries ( e.g. timing of practice or competition, time of season, etc). Richardson (1999) 
found that 54% of 886 injuries occurred during competition and 32% occurred during 
practice (Richardson, 1999). McFarland and Wasik (1996) found that the most common 
injury occurring during cross-training were leg injuries, occurring 24% of the time. As 
for specific injuries, most swimmers (83%) stated that the shoulder pain was more 
bothersome during the first and middle parts of the season (Richardson et al., 1980). 
What is the Outcome? 
Time Loss 
Richardson et al. (1980) found that of the 5 8 swimmers, who complained of 
shoulder pain during the physician-based examination, 43 swimmers had to reduce their 
daily swimming yardage and 21 were forced to stop training all together. Grote et al., 
(2004) found that swimmers with thigh injuries missed on average 7-12 practices each 
season depending on their stroke preference. They also found that breaststroke swimmers 
were more likely to miss practice because of adductor pain ( 42. 7%) and missed an 
average of 11.5 practices a season (Grote et al., 2004). 
16 
r 
The South Australian Branch of Sports Medicine found that 75% of the total 
injuries sustained by 3 52 national swimmers were classified as minor injuries that did not 
restrict the swimmer from participating in competitions and practices, and 12.5% were 
considered major injuries requiring the swimmer to leave the competition and not finish 
(Grimmer et al., 1996). 
Finally, Stocker et al. (1995) found that 47% of 532 collegiate swimmers and 
48% of 395 master swimmers had a history of shoulder pain that lasted three or more 
weeks and that it was severe enough to force the swimmer to change his/her swimming 
routine or stop swimming altogether. 
Clinical Outcome 
Stoker et al. (1995) gave 532 collegiate swimmers and 395 master swimmers 
questionnaires to determine prevalence of shoulder pain. The results showed that 
collegiate swimmers (55%) were more likely to seek medical attention about their 
shoulder pain than master swimmers (39%). The results from this study suggest that the 
prevalence rate of shoulder pain does not change as the swimmer gets older and that 
shoulder pain can similarly affect both groups ability to swim (Stoker et al., 1995). 
However, this study did not account for any collegiate or master swimmers who dropped 
out of participating because of an injury (i.e. study of survivors only). 
The literature search did not reveal any studies that reported information on 
catastrophic injuries, residual effects of injuries, recurrent injuries, or injuries that force 
the competitive swimmer to drop out of participation. 
What are the Risk Factors? 
Intrinsic 
17 
To date the only intrinsic risk factor that has been examined has been gender. 
Sallis et al. (2001) found that female swimmers were more likely to sustain an injury than 
male swimmers (47.08% compared to 12.37%, p< 0.0001). The study also reported 
gender differences in specific injuries related to anatomical location. Female swimmers 
were more likely to sustain injuries to the shoulder (21.05% vs. 6.55%, p<0.01) and knee 
(5.85% vs. 1.45%, p<0.01) compared to their male counterparts. Both factors were 
statistically tested using Fisher's exact test in SPSS. A short-coming of this study, 
however, was that it did not use exposure-based injury rates as a basis for testing risk 
factors nor did it account for other risk factors that may help explain differences. Other 
than this study, the literature search did not reveal any studies that tested the relationship 
between intrinsic risk factors and the incidence of injuries in competitive swimming. 
Some additional intrinsic risk factors of interest may include: injury history, a positive 
musculoskeletal assessment, and percentage of body fat. 
Extrinsic 
The literature search did not reveal any studies that tested the relationship 
between extrinsic factors and swimming injuries. Extrinsic risk factors of interest may 
include swimming classification (high school or club swimmers), yardage, years of 
experience in competitive swimming and coaching qualifications. Equipment that may 
relate to increased risk of injury includes the use of hand paddles, kick boards, and 
flippers. 
What are the Inciting Events? 
Since swimming is such a highly repetitive sport, it is no surprise that the majority 
of the injuries occurring in swimming are classified as overuse injuries. The high 
prevalence of shoulder pain is symptomatic of the excessive wear and tear that the 
18 
r 
shoulder complex must endure during swimming. On average, each shoulder goes 
through more than one million revolutions during each competitive season (Johnson, 
2003). Elbow injuries are similar since they are also caused by repetitive motions, in 
particular the high elbow position during the pull phase of the butterfly, breast, and free 
style strokes. Research has demonstrated that swimmers who experience these elbow 
injuries have been known to compensate by dropping their elbow into the water which 
places more pressure on the shoulder, and makes the swimmer more susceptible to 
shoulder pain and inflammation (Fowler & Regan, 1986). 
Lower extremity injuries occur in swimmers because of the repetitive leg motions 
generated by forceful kicks they complete in order to propel themselves forward in the 
water (Richardson, 1987). When the kick is performed multiple times during a practice or 
competition, an excessive valgus force begins to affect the medial collateral ligament 
(MCL) of the knee and an inflammatory response occurs causing pain and discomfort. 
Ankle injuries are caused by the extreme plantarflexion of the ankle during each 
kick cycle, stretching the tendons and retinaculum beyond their normal limits (Kennedy 
et al., 1978). 
Future Research 
The need for future research in the area of injuries in competitive swimming 
arises from the gaps in the current research. These are as follows: 
• Overall injury occurrence: (not specific anatomical locations) especially 
research that identifies overall injury rates that relate to time exposures (# 
of injuries per 1000 hours swimming or AEs). In addition, a more in-depth 
look at the timing of these injuries should also be included in research on 
overall injury rates. 
19 
• The lack of prospective designed studies: the majority of past research is 
retrospective in nature and dependent on questionnaires (i.e. subject to 
recall bias). 
• Prevalence of pain and how it relates to injury occurrence: research in this 
area would also help in gathering further information about injury onset as 
it relates to swimming injuries. 
• Injury outcomes: including time loss associated with injury, the clinical 
outcomes of injuries (includes information of catastrophic injuries, 
residual effects of injuries, recurrent injuries, dropping out of participation 
due to injury), and economic cost associated with injury. 
• Studying risk factors associated with injuries is important because if a risk 
factor has been shown to relate to increased risk of injury steps can be 
taken to reduce or eliminate this risk factor. Examples of possible intrinsic 
risk factors include injury history, a positive musculoskeletal assessment, 
gender, and percentage of body fat. Examples of extrinsic risk factors 
include swimming classification (high school or club swimmers), yardage, 
and years in competitive swimming.

CHAPTER III 
METHOD 
Participants 
In this study all participants were swimmers for the University of North Dakota 
Division I swimming team. Consent was obtained from each participant in writing, giving 
his/her approval to participate in the study and for access to their medical files from the 
UND Athletic Training Room. This sample is considered a sample of convenience. The 
number of participants is based on the number of swimmers who agreed to participate 
and maintained participation through out the entire study. 
Study Design 
As shown in Figure 1, the study was prospective cohort in nature. Baseline data, 
which consists of demographic information and injury history was gathered on the 
participants prior to the start of the competitive season. Afterward, the participants were 
monitored forward in time for the duration of the regular swimming season ( 6 months) to 
determine the nature and incidence of injuries. Injury was defined as one that (1) 
occurred as a result of participation in organized swimming practice or competition, (2) 
resulted in restriction of the student athlete's participation or performance and/or (3) 
required the student athlete to seek medical attention by a Certified Athletic Trainer or 
team physician. Following injury surveillance, data were analyzed to determine incidence 
rate and distribution of injuries. Additionally, incidence rate was used as a basis for 
analyzing risk factors.

Figure One. Timeline for Prospective Study 
Instruments and Procedures 
Pre-season 
Approval to conduct this study was obtained from the University of North Dakota 
Institutional Review Board. Each participant signed a consent form (Appendix A) that 
outlines the requirements of the study and a Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act (HIP AA) form (Appendix B) that allowed the researcher to look into 
participant's medical records in the UND Athletic Training Room. On September 8, 2009 
baseline data were collected from each participant including basic demographic 
information such as age, gender, swimming experience, competitive level, past training 
regimen, and past injury history. For the majority of the swimmers (those that were with 
UND during the 2007-2008 season) information pertaining to past injury history was 
supplemented using their medical records from the UND Athletic Training Room. This 
injury surveillance portion of the study began the first day the UND swim team started 
regular season practice (September 9, 2008). 
Pre-participation Examination 
Before any swimmer was able to start practicing, he/she was required to complete 
a pre-participation exam with the UND athletic training staff. This exam included a brief 
medical history questionnaire, anthropometric measurements (height and weight), a brief 
22 
musculoskeletal assessment, and a section to be completed by the team physician. This 
form varied slightly for returning swimmers versus new (freshman) swimmers. This 
variation shortened the musculoskeletal assessment and physician section for the 
returning swimmers. The information from pre-participation exams was used to assist in 
identifying any previous injuries that affected the swimmers. 
Medical History Questionnaire 
Swimmers were asked to complete a medical history questionnaire (Appendix C) 
which was dispensed to each individual swimmer during a 30-minute meeting held by the 
researcher. This questionnaire prompted the swimmers to provide information about their 
swimming experience and about the injuries that they incurred during the past twelve 
months. Information provided in this questionnaire was be used in the study to help 
determine whether previous injury was a risk factor for new injury. 
Competitive Season 
Injury data 
An injury report form was designed (Appendix D) to record all injuries that the 
swimmer identified throughout the course of the study. This form is a modification of the 
form used by the NCAA Injury Surveillance System, and was modified to record 
swimming-related injuries. The injury report form is intended to provide an in-depth look 
at the injury including anatomical location, injury onset, injury mechanism, type of 
injury, timing of injury, and time lost from injury. 
Injury incidence information was obtained as follows: (1) each week the 
researcher asked the Certified Athletic Trainer assigned to swimming if there were any 
new injuries, (2) the researcher attended practice once a week to see if there were any 
new injuries that were affecting the swimmers and to see how past injuries were 
23 
,.. 
progressing, and (3) the swimming coach was contacted weekly and asked about 
swimmers who had not been practicing or had limited practice due to an injury. If the 
researcher was informed of any new injuries an injury report form was filled out. If the 
swimmer was unavailable at practice the researcher emailed the swimmer immediately 
after practice to enable completion of the injury report form. 
Exposure data 
In addition to collecting information about injury incidence the researcher also 
collected data that pertained to the swimmers' exposure time. The swimmers were asked 
to complete a weekly training log to track their attendance, time spent training, and 
yardage. The weekly training log was distributed to the swimmers through a packet given 
to them at the beginning of the study. However, there were several compliance issues 
which arose throughout the study. As a result, exposure data including attendance 
records, daily yardage, and length of practices (in hours) were obtained from the head 
coach. 
Data Analysis 
The study concluded at the end of the regular competitive season. When the study 
was finished the researcher made sure that all the injury and exposure data forms were 
completed for each swimmer. Once all data forms were completed, data from the entire 
study was entered into an Excel spread sheet to assist in transferring the data into a 
statistical package. Once the data were entered, various measures of central tendency 
were calculated and recorded into table format. In addition, both descriptive and 
analytical analyses were performed. 
Descriptive Data Analysis 
24 
r 
A descriptive analysis of data was ran to determine the rate and nature of injuries 
that affected the swimmers during an entire season (6 months). Two injury rates were 
calculated: (1) by dividing the total number of injuries sustained by the total number of 
hours trained, then multiplying this figure by 1000. This approach yielded an injury rate 
per 1000 hours exposure, and (2) by dividing the total number of injuries sustained by the 
total number of athletic exposures, then multiplying this figure by 1000. This approach 
yielded an injury rate per 1000 athletic exposures. In addition information on injury 
distribution ( e.g. location, type) was calculated in terms of numbers and relative 
percentage of injuries. The frequencies and compute variable procedures in SPSS 16 
(SPSS Inc: Chicago, IL) were used to determine the number, percentage, rate of injuries, 
and 95% confidence intervals. 
Rick Factor Analysis 
A Poisson regression model was fitted using generalized estimating equations 
(GEE) to estimate incidence rate ratios (IRR, 95% CI). The swimmer's individual injury 
rates were used as outcome variables. Predictor variables included gender, previous 
injury to same anatomical location, previous injury at other sites, and years swimming 
competitively. Each of these predictors was entered separately in an unadjusted model to 
estimate injury rate ratios (IRR's) for each risk factor. In addition, the risk factors were 
also entered into an adjusted model to compare risk factors to each other. All risk factors 
were included in the adjusted model because of the small sample size and few risk 
factors. The Poisson regression procedures in statistical package R (R Development Core 
Team: Auckland, New Zealand) was used to compute the IRR's in both the unadjusted 
and adjusted analysis.

CHAPTER IV 
RESULTS 
Descriptive Results 
Demographic Information 
Baseline data collection began on September 8, 2008, following a preseason 
practice. At that time forty-three swimmers were asked to participate in this study. Those 
interested in participating were asked to complete a participant information form and 
medical history questionnaire that asked about any swim-related injuries sustained during 
the past 12 months. Table four summarizes the participant's demographic information. Of 
the thirty-four swimmers who agreed to participate, 16 were male (47.1 %) and 18 female 
(52.9%), with an overall mean age of 19.47 years (SD= 1.461 years). There were 17 
freshman (50% of the total participants), 6 sophomores (17.6%), 6 juniors (17.6%), and 5 
seniors (14.7%). Nine swimmers decided not to participate in this study, of which 6 were 
female swimmers and 3 were male swimmers. In addition, five of the 9 were seniors in 
college and four were freshman. 
Additional demographic information obtained included the age that participants 
started swimming competitively, how many years they had been swimming, and how 
many competitions they had completed in during the past twelve months. As shown in 
table 4 the mean age started swimming was slightly higher in male swimmers (M= 8.75 
yrs) than in female swimmers (M=8.22 yrs). But the total number of years swimming was 
slightly higher in female swimmers (M=l 1.11 yrs) than male swimmers (M= 10.88 yrs). 
26 
Lastly, male swimmers on average participated in more competitions during the past 12 
months than their female counterparts (M= 12.44 competitions compared to M=l 1.28 
competitions).

Injury History 
In addition to the demographic information, information on medical history of 
swim-related injuries from the past twelve months was obtained. Seventeen of the 34 
(50%) swimmers, including 7 males and 10 females, reported a total of 23 injuries in the 
12 months prior to completing the questionnaire. Nine injuries were sustained by male 
swimmers and 14 injuries were sustained by female swimmers. A percent distribution of 
anatomical location of these injuries is provided in table 5. The most common anatomical 
locations were the shoulder, accounting for 11 (47.9%) injuries and the knee accounting 
for 5 (21.8%). 
A percent distribution of injuries by injury type is provided in table 6. As shown, 
the most common type of injury sustained in the year prior to the swim season was 
shoulder impingement, accounting for 11 (47.8%) injuries followed by patellar tendonitis 
accounting for 5 injuries (21.8%).

Injury Rates 
The prospective portion of this study began on September 9, 2008, which was the 
first day of the regular swimming season. During the study period (9/9/09 -2/28/09), 
exposure data were gathered from the following sources: practice attendance records, 
training logs (yardage per practice), length of training sessions, and injury report forms 
for injuries sustained during the study period. From these data, the researcher was abk to 
determine number of athletic exposures (AEs) accumulated by each participant during the 
season, an estimated number of yards that each swimmer completed during practices 
28 
throughout the season (based on coach records), how many injuries each participant 
sustained, and extensive information on the nature of injuries sustained. 
The exposure and injury data are summarized in Table 7. Examination of this 
table reveals that there were a total of 5,585 athletic exposures accumulated by the 34 
swimmers. Of the 5,585 athletic exposures, practice accounted for 5,206 AEs and 
competitions accounted for 3 79 AEs. As for yardage, the participants swam a combined 
total of 22,346,909 yards during practice throughout the season. In addition, the 
participants accumulated an estimated 10,180 hours of practice time.

As shown in Table 7, twenty of the 34 participants (58.8%) sustained a total of 31 
injuries during the study period. Of the 31 injuries sustained 13 injuries were incurred by 
9 male swimmers and 18 injuries were incurred by 11 female swimmers. Fourteen 
swimmers (41.2%) did not sustain an injury during the season, 11 swimmers (32.4%) 
sustained one injury, 8 swimmers (23.5%) sustained 2 injuries, and one swimmer (2.9%) 
sustained four injuries. 
Two different injury rates were calculated. The overall injury rate for athletic 
exposures was 5.55 injuries per 1,000 athletic exposures. All injuries were sustained 
29 
r 
during practice and training sessions therefore a separate injury rate for practice and 
competition AEs was not calculated. The overall injury rate for hours practiced was 3.04 
injuries per 1,000 hours practiced. Injury rates were higher for female swimmers, both 
when rates were calculated with reference to AEs (6.06 vs. 4.97) and hours of practice 
(3.32 vs. 2.74). However the differences were not significant. 
Injury Location 
Table 8 displays a percent comparison of injuries by anatomical location and 
gender. The most common locations were shoulder accounting for 12 injuries (38.7%), 
back for 5 injuries (16.1 %), and knee for 4 injuries (12.9%). The most common 
anatomical location for both male and female swimmers was the shoulder, accounting for 
6 injuries each. However, the second most common anatomical location for male 
swimmers was the back (3 injuries) whereas it was the ankle for the female swimmers ( 4 
injuries).

A percent comparison of the specific type of injury sustained by the participants 
in this study is shown in table 9. Injury type is defined as the exact injury that the 
30 
r 
participant was diagnosed as having by the Certified Athletic Trainer or team physician. 
The most common injury type was shoulder impingement which accounted for 6 injuries 
(19.4%). Shoulder impingement/bicipital tendonitis was the second most common injury 
type. This injury type was sustained by 5 participants and accounted for 16.1 % of the 
total injuries. Another common injury type was ankle tendonitis. This injury type was 
found in 4 swimmers and accounted for 12.8% of all the injuries.

Table 9 also shows a percent comparison of injury type by gender. The most 
common injury type for male swimmers was shoulder impingement, which accounted 4 
of the 13 injuries (30.8%). Back strains were the second most common injury type in 
male swimmers, which accounted for 3 of the 13 injuries (23.1 %). As for female 
swimmers, the most common injury types were ankle tendonitis and the combination 9f 
shoulder impingement and bicipital tendonitis, each accounting for 4 of the 18 injuries 
31 
r 
(22.2%). These were followed closely by shoulder impingement, patellar tendonitis, back 
strain, and hamstring strain, each accounting for 2 injuries (11.1 % ). 
Injury Onset 
Injury onset is typically divided into two main categories: acute and overuse 
injuries. Acute injuries are classified as those that occur suddenly without prior pain or 
discomfort (i.e. MCL sprain) and overuse injuries are those that occur as a result of 
repetitive motion and/or impact on the particular area and usually occur with gradual 
increase in pain and discomfort (i.e. bicepital tendonitis). It is thought that because of 
swimming's highly repetitive nature, more overuse injuries will be sustained than acute 
injuries. As shown in Table 10, overuse injuries occurred more frequently, accounting for 
18 of the 31 injuries (58.1 %). Acute injuries accounted for 13 injuries ( 41.9%). Of the 13 
injuries sustained by male swimmers, acute onset injuries were more common, 7 injuries 
(53.8%), compared to overuse injuries, 6 injuries (46.2%). In female swimmers overuse 
onset, with 12 injuries (66.7%) was twice as frequent as acute onset, with 6 injuries 
(33.3%).

Further analysis shows that all 12 shoulder injuries (66.7% of all overuse injuries) 
were classified as overuse injuries, making it the most common anatomical location fo! 
overuse injuries. As for acute injuries the back was the most common anatomical location 
with 5 injuries (38.5%). In addition, the most common overuse injury was shoulder 
32 
r 
impingement, 6 injuries (33.3%). Back muscle strains (5 injuries [38.5%]) were the most 
common acute injury.

Injury classification was used to differentiate if the injury was a new injury or if 
the swimmer had previously experienced a similar injury. The three categories that were 
used to classify an injury were: (1) new injury, (2) recurrence of injury from previous 
swim season, and (3) recurrence of injury from the current season. For the purpose of this 
study, recurrence of injury was defined an injury that occurs to the same body part and is 
the same injury type as one that had previous occurred. However, in many cases a re­
injury is more severe than the first injury. 
The most common injury classification was new injury, accounting for 19 injuries 
(61.3%). Of those injuries 7 were sustained by male swimmers and 12 by female 
swimmers. The second most common injury classification was recurrence of injury from 
previous season, accounting for 10 injuries (32.2%). Lastly two injuries (6.5%) were 
classified as a repeat injury from the current season. 
Mechanism of Injury 
During the study period there were three distinctive injury mechanisms: (1) 
repetitive motion, (2) weight lifting, and (3) dry-land training, such as running and 
agility. However, an additional category (no specific reason) was added for those injuries 
where the swimmer was unable to identify a specific injury mechanism. Table 11 
displays a percent comparison of mechanism of injury. Overall, the most common 
mechanism was repetitive motion which accounted for 19 of the 31 injuries (61.3%) -
sustained during the season. In addition, repetitive motion was the most common 
mechanism for both male (10 injuries) and female (9 injuries) swimmers.

Time Loss 
For this study, time loss was calculated based on the number of practices that the 
swimmer either missed completely or did not participant in fully because of an injury. 
The time loss was divided into three main categories: less than 7 days, 7-21 days, and 
more than 21 days. Table 12 shows a percent comparison of time loss associated to 
injuries. The most common time loss category was less than 7 days, which accounted for 
18 injuries (58.1 %). Of those 18 injuries, 8 occurred to male swimmers (61.5% of all 
male injuries) and 10 occurred to female swimmers (55.6% of all female injuries).

Further analysis shows that the back and ankle, each accounting for 4 injuries 
(22.2%) are the most common injury locations for the time category of less than 7 days. 
These are followed by the shoulder and knee, accounting for 3 injuries each (16. 7% ). In 
the more than 21 days time loss category, the shoulder was the most common injury 
location accounting for 6 injuries (85.7%).

As for injury type, ankle tendonitis and back strain were the most common injury 
type for the less than 7 days time loss category. As for the second category (7-21 days), 
shoulder impingement was the most common injury type, accounting for 2 of the 6 
injuries (33.3%). Additionally, the two most common injury types for the more than 21 
days lost were shoulder impingement and the combination of bicepital tendonitis and 
shoulder impingement, each accounting for 3 of the 7 injuries (42.9%). Lastly, both 
overuse (8 injuries ( 44.4% )) and acute injuries (10 injuries (76.9% )) were more 
frequently related to fewer than 7 days of time loss than the other two categories. 
Risk Factor Data Analysis 
Risk factors of interest in this study included gender, years swimming 
competitively, a history of injury to any body part, and a history of injury to the same 
body part that was injured in the study. These risk factors were analyzed in both an 
unadjusted (risk factors analyzed alone) and adjusted (risk factors analyzed with others) 
Poisson regression model that was fitted using general estimating equations to estimate 
incidence rate ratios. Any risk factors that had a p-value of< .02 were considered 
statistically significant. 
Table 13 shows both the unadjusted and adjusted results of the regression and 
identifies the injury rate ratio per 1000 hours training for each risk factor. History of any 
injury and history to a specific body part were found to be statistically significant. Having 
a history of any injury was associated with nearly four times increase in injury rate (IRR= 
3.79, 95% CI= 1.59, 9.05) than not having a history of injury, before adjusting for the 
other factors. This number decreases (IRR= 2.86, 95% CI= 1.23, 6.64) after adjustment 
for other factors. As for swimmers with a history of injury to the same specific body part 
the unadjusted injury rate was almost two and halftimes higher (IRR= 2.42, 95% CI= 
35 
r 
1.73, 3.40) than for those that did not have a history. When this risk factor is adjusted to 
account for the other risk factors, swimmers with a specific history of injury had more 
than one and halftimes the risk (IRR=l.67, 95% CI= 1.21, 2.31) of injury than those that 
did not have this history. 
Both gender and number of years competing in swimming were found to be 
statistically non-significant predictors of injuries. However, male swimmers were found 
to be less likely to sustain an injury than female swimmers in both the unadjusted (IRR= 
0.69, 95% CI= 0.34, 1.42) and adjusted (IRR= 0.78, 95% CI= 0.49, 1.23) models. 
However, these differences were not tested statistically. 
As for injury rate ratios per 1000 AEs, Table 14 shows both the unadjusted and 
adjusted analysis of the risk factors. Similar to the rates per 1000 hours, history of any 
injury significantly increased the swimmer's rate of injury more than three and a half 
times (IRR= 3.64, 95% CI= 1.51, 8.73) in the unadjusted model and more than two and a 
half times (IRR= 2. 74, 95% CI= 1.18, 6.3 7) after adjusting for the other risk factors. In 
addition, history of injury to the same specific body part was found to have almost a two 
and a halftimes increase (IRR= 2.46, 95% CI= 1.75, 3.46) in the unadjusted estimate and 
almost a twofold increase in the adjusted model (IRR= 1.75, 95% CI= 1.25, 2.45). 
Once again, both gender and years competing were not found to be significant 
predictors. Like the previous model, male swimmers still had a lower injury rate than 
female swimmers in both the unadjusted and adjusted model (IRR= 0.72, 95% CI= 0.35, 
1.48). However, these differences were not tested statistically.

CHAPTER V 
DISCUSSION 
Descriptive Analysis 
Injury Rate 
Table 15 shows a comparison between this study and the previously published 
studies about swimming-related injuries. To date, there is only one published study that 
reported the rate of injuries per 1000 athletic exposures (AEs). McFarland & Wasik, 1996 
computed retrospectively an injury rate of 1.05 injuries per 1000 AEs. However, in this 
study the researcher was able to compute prospectively a much higher injury rate of 5.55 
injuries per 1000 AEs. The high rate reported in this study may reflect the prospective 
nature of follow up and the use of a Certified Athletic Trainer to collect data. No 
previously published studies have reported injury rate as a function of time exposure (per 
1000 hours). However, this study reported an injury rate of 3.04 injuries per 1000 hours. 
As for injury rates by gender, this study found that female swimmers had higher 
injury rates than males swimmers for both reported injury rates, AEs and hours (6.06 vs. 
4.97 and 3.32 vs. 2.74 respectfully). However, these differences were not tested 
statistically. Similarly, Sallis et al. (2001) reported that overall female swimmers had a 
significantly higher injury rate per 100 athletes than male swimmers (47.08 vs. 12.37). 
In addition to swimming related research, there have been several studies that 
looked at the injury rate in other collegiate "overhead" sports with similar reported 
injuries. These sports include baseball, softball, and volleyball. Table 16 shows a

comparison of injury rates in these sports and the injury rate from this study. All three 
similar sports reported higher injury rates than this study. Both baseball and softball had 
the highest injury rates which may be because both baseball and softball average about 42 
games a season where swimming only averages about 11 competitions a season. As for 
volleyball, the injury rate was still slightly higher than that of swimming however, similar 
injuries, such as tendonitis and back strains were observed in both volleyball and 
swimming. Other previous research compared injury rates per 100 athletes by gender in 
basketball, track, swimming, soccer, tennis, water polo, and cross country. They reported 
that overall, female athletes had a higher injury rate than male athletes (52.45 vs. 47.68) 
(Sallis et al., 2001). Basketball was found to have the highest overall injury rate per 100 
athletes for both male (126.94) and female (112.04) athletes (Sallis et al., 2001). 
Injury Location 
Table 17 shows the percent comparison by anatomical location for previous 
published studies and this study. Like similar studies (Kennedy et al., 1978, Grimmer et 
al., 1996 & McFarland & Wasik, 1996), this study identified the shoulder as the most 
common anatomical location for injuries. In addition, the percentage of shoulder injuries 
sustained in this study was within the range of percentages that the other studies observed 
(3-55% were shoulder injuries). This study found that 38.7% of all injuries sustained in 
the swimming season were to the shoulder. This high percentage of shoulder injuries 
would be expected because of the highly repetitive motion that the shoulder experiences 
during a swimming season. In addition, this study found that female swimmers had a 
higher percentage of shoulder injuries ( 46.2%) compared to male swimmers (33.3%). -
However this difference was not tested statistically. Similar findings were reported by

Sallis et al. (2001) who found that female swimmers had a significantly higher shoulder 
injury rate (per 100 athletes) than male swimmers (21.05 vs. 6.55). 
Other studies reported the highest percentage of injuries involved the back 
(Mutoh et al., 1988) and ankle (Richardson, 1999). Although these locations were not 
found to have the highest percentages in this study, each anatomical location was within 
the ranges that the previous research observed. In this study, 12.9% of all injuries 
involved the ankle which could be due to the forceful kicking motion during swimming. 
The percentage of back injuries sustained by the participants of this study was (16.1 %) 
and interestingly only two of the 5 back injuries occurred during weight lifting activities. 
Back injuries in swimming are relatively common because of the high stress placed on 
the back during the breathing phases of specific strokes ( such as the breaststroke, 
backstroke, and freestyle) and during flip-turns. 
This study reports only 12.9% of the injuries sustained in the season were related 
to the knee. This finding was unexpected because the majority of the previously 
published studies found much higher percentage oflmee injuries (20-28% of injuries). It 
would be expected to find higher proportion of knee injuries because of the chronic stress 
placed on the knee during kicking, especially with breaststroke. However the majority of 
swimmers at the collegiate level may perform preventative measures to reduce the 
occurrence of lmee pain during the season. 
Injury Type 
This study showed that the most common injury type associated with swimming 
was tendonitis. In total, eighteen of the 31 injuries were classified as tendonitis. The most 
common form of tendonitis was shoulder impingement, which is a specific form of 
tendonitis that affects the rotator cuff tendons within the shoulder. Previous research has 
43 
identified "swimmers shoulder" as a common injury affecting competitive swimmers 
(Johnson et al., 1987). "Swimmers shoulder" is defined as an impingement syndrome that 
affects either the supraspinatus muscle tendon, biceps brachii tendon or both (Johnson et 
al., 1987). This particular diagnosis was not specifically used in this study; however, 
similar injuries were identified as being problematic. These included shoulder 
impingement, bicipital tendonitis, and the combination of shoulder impingement and 
bicipital tendonitis. Previous research states that the higher incidence of tendonitis in the 
shoulder complex compared to other locations demonstrates the intense stress that is 
placed on the shoulder during swimming. (Ciullo & Stevens, 1989) 
Another area affected by tendonitis was the ankle which accounted for 4 of the 18 
tendonitis injuries. Past research has identified inflammation of the extensor retinaculum 
and underlying extensor muscle tendons of the distal ankle as the most common injury 
type related to the ankle (Kennedy et al., 1978). Similarly, another study reported that 
tendonitis most commonly occurs to the extensor tendons because of the swimmers 
excessive stretching of the anterior compartment of the lower leg in hopes of achieving 
greater ankle flexibility (Johnson, Sim, & Scott, 1987) Although no specific tendon was 
identified within this study, tendons that assist in the plantarflexon and dorsiflexion of the 
ankle are most commonly affected by this type of injury. 
In this study, female swimmer incurred a higher percentage oftendonitis type 
injuries than male swimmers (66.6% vs. 46.2%). However, this apparent difference was 
not tested statistically. Currently there is no additional swimming related research that 
looks specifically at gender and injury type. 
Strains, accounting for 11 of the 31 injuries, were the next most common injury 
type in this study. Locations for these strains included the back, neck, hamstring, and 
44 
groin. According to previous research, back strains are common in swimming and should 
be monitored to make sure that the swimmer doesn't have a more serious injury such as 
spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis (Kammer et al., 1999). No swimmer in this study 
sustained either; however, two swimmers complained regularly of intense back pain that 
forced them to reduce their swimming and seek the advice of a team physician. In 
addition, another study found an increase in strains of the lumbar fascia in lower back in 
swimmers. That study identified a lack of lumbar flexibility as the main cause of this 
increase in back strains (Richardson, 1999) 
As for hamstring and groin strains, these can be associated with the kicking forces 
that are produced by swimmers. Previous research reported that these strains account for 
5% of all injuries sustained in competitive swimming (McFarland & Wasik, 1996 & 
Grimmer et al., 1996). Another study (Grote et al., 2004) found that swimmers who 
compete regularly in breaststroke events had a higher percentage of groin strains (42.7%) 
than any other swimmer. This study was not able to separate the swimmers by stroke but 
based on information from the participants those affected by groin strains did compete 
regularly in breaststroke events. No studies were found that looked specifically at 
hamstring stains. 
Injury Onset 
To date, there has been minimal research conducted on the different types of 
injury onset and their relation to swimming injuries. Previous researchers (McMaster, 
1999) have only speculated that the majority of swimming related injuries are overuse in 
nature. This study was able to reinforce this by finding that the majority of the injuries 
sustained in the season were overuse injuries. However, the percentage of overuse 
injuries was not far above that of the percentage of acute injuries ( 5 8 .1 % of injuries were 
45 
overuse and 41.9% were acute). Perhaps different from other studies, the acute injuries 
sustained in this study were not necessarily the typical traumatic acute injuries such as 
broken bones. In this study, acute injuries included muscle strains and sprains. These 
were classified as acute injuries because of the sudden onset of pain. However, some 
injuries such as strains may be classified as acute because of the sudden onset of pain but 
may actually be overuse in nature because of the slow progression of trauma to the 
muscle from the repetitive motions in swimming. 
Time Loss 
Time loss associated with an injury can vary based on several different factors 
including the severity of the injury, the athlete's compliance to treatment, the athlete's 
perception of pain, and the overall healing process. For instance, one may think that an 
overuse shoulder injury may require a swimmer to sit out of practice longer than a 
sprained ankle. Previous research has reported that the majority of injuries affecting 
swimmers were minor with very little to no time loss (Grimmer et al., 1996). This study 
reported that 18 of the 31 injuries required less than 7 days time loss. Within this 
category, the most common anatomical locations were the back and ankles with 4 injuries 
each followed by shoulder and knee with 3 injuries and lastly the hamstring and groin 
with 2 injuries each. A high number of injuries within this category may demonstrate the 
swimmer's drive to train and compete within the sport they are so passionate about. 
As for the more than 21 days time loss, Stocker et al. (1995), reported that 
swimmers experiencing shoulder pain were more likely to sit out for extended periods of 
time (3 weeks or more) than those that did not experience shoulder pain. Similarly, in this 
study it was reported that overuse shoulder injuries were associated with the highest 
amount of time loss. This high amount of time loss could be because of the highly 
46 
F 
repetitive nature of swimming or the difficulty treating inflammation within the shoulder 
because of its anatomical structure. An excessive amount of time loss (21 days or more) 
is very problematic because it adversely affects the swimmers training and performance 
in the swimming season. 
As for gender differences based on time loss, this study reported that female 
swimmers had a higher percentage of injuries that required more than 21 days time loss 
than male swimmers (27.8 vs. 15.4%). However, this apparent difference was not tested 
statistically. In addition, based on percentages of overall injuries male swimmers had a 
higher percentage (61.5%) of injuries that required less than 7 days time loss than female 
swimmers (55.6%). However, this apparent difference was not tested statistically. To date 
there has been no published swimming related studies that compared gender difference 
and time loss. 
Other studies that looked at similar sports reported time loss as anything that 
required more than 10 days of time loss as the most severe category. Studies reporting 
injuries in baseball, softball, and volleyball found that lower extremity injuries were most 
commonly associated with more than 10 days time loss (Dick et al., 2007, Marshall et al., 
2007, & Agel et al., 2007). However, this study reported that shoulder injuries, 
accounting for 9 injuries, were most commonly associated with 7 days of time loss or 
more. 
Risk Factor Analysis 
The risk factor analysis for this study was completed using the Poisson regression 
fitted using generalized estimating equations and showed that both a history of any injury 
and a history of injury to a specific body part significantly predicted an increase in the 
risk of injury per 1000 hours and per 1000 AEs. This increase is evident in the large 
47 
number of overuse injuries that the swimmers sustained during the study period. Perhaps 
these were old injuries that never fully healed and/or were never fully 
treated/rehabilitated. As for gender, although not statistically significant, this study was 
able to report that female swimmers had a higher injury rate than male swimmers with 
both injury rate categories. 
To date, there has been only one study that examined risk factors associated with 
injuries in competitive swimming. Those authors found that female swimmers were more 
likely to sustain an injury than male swimmers (Sallis et al., 2001). However, the authors 
only calculated injury rates per 100 athletes and did not account for any time exposure. 
This study found similar findings in both the unadjusted and adjusted models for both 
injury rates per 1000 hours training and per 1000 AEs. No other studies have looked at 
risk factors associated to injuries in competitive swimming. 
As for studies that looked at other sports, Knowles et al. (2006) reported on risk 
factors of injuries in football, soccer, basketball, track, baseball, softball, wrestling, and 
volleyball. Researchers reported that athletes with a previous injury had almost three 
times the injury rate in the unadjusted model and twice the injury in the adjusted model 
than athletes with no previous injury. As for gender, the researchers didn't look at gender 
differences overall however, they did break down specific sports based off gender (i.e. 
basketball, track, and soccer). For instance, baseball and softball players have similar 
injury rates in both the unadjusted (0.95 vs. 0.96) and the adjusted models (0.26 vs. 0.28) 
(Knowles et al., 2006). 
Suggestions for Future Research 
This is one of only two studies that reported the incidence rate of injuries that 
affect intercollegiate swimmers. In addition, it is the only current study that is a 
48 
prospective cohort design. Therefore, future research in this area should include the 
following: 
• Additional prospective cohort studies that follow the swimmers forward in 
time over longer periods of time to record injuries as they occur. 
• Studies that look at different age groups such as high school, elite, 
masters, Olympic, etc. 
• Comparing injuries across different levels of competitive swimming. 
• Studies that involve a larger number of participants such as including a 
larger team or including more than one team or conference. 
• Studies that look at the difference in injuries that occur during practices as 
oppose to competitions 
• Additional studies that analyze risk factors including body composition, 
most common stroke used, coaching qualifications, and training devices 
(kick boards). 
• Randomized clinical trails that identify and evaluate specific preventative 
measures 
Conclusion 
For years, injuries have been known to affect a swimmers ability to perform at the 
top of their abilities yet surprisingly, there is still very little research that looked at these 
injuries. This study was designed to add to current literature and some interesting data 
relating to injuries in competitive swimming was found. For instance, this study 
calculated an injury rate of 5.55 injuries per 1000 athletic exposures and 3.04 injuries per 
1000 hours. This number is relatively similar to those that are seen in other studies and in 
49 
other sports with similar injuries. This study also identified that overuse shoulder injuries 
were the most problematic for swimmers followed by overuse injuries to the knees and 
ankles and acute back strains. Of the risk factors that were examined in this study, both 
history of any injury and history of injury to the same specific body part were found to be 
significant predictors of swimming-related injuries. This study contributed to the current 
literature by providing prospective data collection, injury rates in hours and AEs and 
significant risk factors. However, further research is still needed to examine swimming 
related injuries and their risk factors more closely to hopefully reduce injury occurrence 
to a minimum.

determine the relationship between injuries and specific risk factors such as gender, 
previous years of competitive swimming, previous injuries, and yardage. This research is 
important because to date there has been little research that looks at the incidence of 
injuries in competitive swimming and the risk factors that are associated with these 
injuries. 
Length of the Study: Your participation in the study will last one complete regular 
season of competitive swimming. You will be contacted by the researcher once a week to 
fill out a training log and to discuss in private any pain or injuries that you have 
experienced during the previous week. Depending on the extent of the pain and/or 
injuries, it may take anywhere from 10 to 30 minutes to complete. The study will end at 
the end of the regular season of UND swimming. 
What Will Happen During This Study: For the first part of the study you will be asked 
to complete a medical history questionnaire that asks about injuries that you may have 
sustained during the past 12 months as a result of participating in swimming practices or 
competitions. This questionnaire will take between 10 to 20 minutes to complete. 
The second part of the study will involve observing and recording any injuries that you 
sustain during the season. You will be contacted weekly to discuss new or persistent 
injuries that you may have experienced. You will be asked to fill out an injury report that 
asks several questions about the details of any pain or injury that you are currently 
experiencing (separate form for pain and injury). In addition you will also be asked to 
complete a weekly training log that will request information about your training regimen 
for the past week.

--------------------------------
Risks of the Study: This study is intended to just observe and record any pain nor 
injuries that occur during the season, there are no foreseenable risks to the participants. 
Benefits of the Study? You may not benefit personally from being in this study. 
However, we hope that, in the future, other people might benefit from this study because 
it will give both coaches and swimmers in-depth data on the types of injuries, the nature 
and incidence of injuries, and risk factors that may increase their risk of injury. 
Confidentiality: All your data and information obtained through forms will remain 
confidential. Your identity will be withheld from data files, sheets, and analyses through 
the use of a numeric coding system. In addition, you will not be identified in any reports 
about this study that might be published. All data will be retained for a period of 3 years 
following completion of this study in a locked container in the PXW office. Any 
information that is obtained in connection with this study and can be identified with you 
will remain confidential and will be disclosed only with your written permission. 
Voluntary Participation: Your decision whether or not to participate is completely 
voluntary and no penalties will result from refusal to participate. Your decision whether 
or not to participate will not affect your current or future relations with the University of 
North Dakota. If you decide to participate, you are free to discontinue participation at any 
time without it being held against you. To discontinue participation, tell the researcher 
that you do not wish to continue with this project.
