 Abstract 
Introduction:   Epidemiologic studies have consistently noted a high incidence and 
prevalence of shoulder pain and dysfunction in competitive swimmers.  The reasons 
for this are probably not singular but many injuries originate from faulty techniques or 
mechanisms.  Some specific freestyle technical flaws heavily stress the shoulders and 
can lead to overuse.  An assessment of an injured swimmer’s biomechanics should 
be conducted to identify factors that may contribute to injury.  Improving stroke 
technique should be considered to prevent shoulder injuries. 
Objectives:   To determine the prevalence of shoulder injuries at the University of the 
Free State’s swimming club (Kovsie Aquatics) during the 2014/2015 swimming 
season, and to investigate if a correlation between certain freestyle biomechanical 
hand and arm positions and shoulder injuries under these swimmers exist. 
Methods:   Sixteen competitive swimmers (6 male, 10 female) adhering to the 
inclusion criteria participated in the study.  Demographic data, general swimming 
information, data on swim training load and shoulder injuries were collected.  All 
participants were subjected to laboratory testing, followed by Aquanex+Video testing 
while sprinting freestyle over 10 metres.  Freestyle biomechanics was analysed with 
the use of an analysis template.  Data captured by the Aquanex+Video hand sensors 
were processed and analysed.  The association between binary risk factors and the 
binary variable “shoulder injury” was assessed using Fisher’s exact test, and the 
relevant P-value is reported.  Furthermore, the risks of injury for subjects with the risk 
factor, and subjects without the risk factor are reported, together with an estimate and 
an exact 95% confidence interval (CI) of the risk ratio (RR).  Similarly, the association 
between quantitative risk factors and shoulder injury was assessed using one-way 
ANOVA. 
Results:  In this study 62.5% of the participants presented with a shoulder injury during 
the 2014/2015 swimming season.  Eighty percent of the female swimmers in this 
population presented with a shoulder injury, compared to 30% of the male swimmers.  
The 17 to 18 years age category seemed to be most susceptible to injury, with 75% of 
the swimmers in this age category presenting with a shoulder injury.  Bilateral shoulder 
injuries were experienced by 70% of the injured swimmers, while 20% experienced 
symptoms on the right side only, and 10% only on the left side.  Sixty percent of the 
injured participants experienced their symptoms only during the early pull through 
x 
 phase while 10% of the swimmers experienced symptoms only during the recovery 
phase.  Thirty percent of the swimmers experienced symptoms during both the early 
pull through and recovery phase.  Although none of the risk factors investigated in this 
study was statistically significant, the presence of the following freestyle 
pathomechanics increased the risk of shoulder injury, and should be considered in 
future research of this problem: 
1. A right hand that crosses the midline upon hand entry; 
2. Thumb first hand entry; 
3. A left hand entering between the midline of the body and the shoulder 
Hand/Arm position where the shoulder is in hyperflexion with the fingers facing 
upward at the end of the entry phase; 
4. Hand position outside the elbow during the early pull through phase; 
5. Swimming ‘catch-up’ stroke. 
Conclusion:  In the current study the prevalence of shoulder injuries is alarmingly 
high at 62.5%.  Female swimmers seem to be at a higher risk for shoulder injuries than 
their male counterparts.  A relationship between certain freestyle pathomechanics and 
shoulder injuries in this population might exist, and some potential risk factors were 
identified.  Due to the relatively small sample size of this study none of the risk factors 
for shoulder injury based on freestyle pathomechanics was statistically significant, thus 
only indications and directions for future research can be suggested.

 1 CHAPTER ONE: Introduction and Problem Statement 
 Introduction 
Swimming is a unique sport that combines upper and lower extremity strength 
exercises with cardiovascular training in a non-weight bearing environment 
(Wanivenhaus et al., 2012).  Competitive swimmers begin their swimming careers as 
early as age seven, and most of them train and compete year round (Sein et al., 2010).  
Intensive training starts early, typically at the age of eight to eleven years, and the 
amount of training can be excessive (Bak, 2010). 
Swim training involves repetitive overhead movement (Sein et al., 2010).  During 
freestyle, 80% of the propulsion power is derived from the pull and 20% from the kick 
(King, 1995).  In a competitive training program a swimmer can easily log up to a 
million arm strokes per year (McMaster, 1999), and can exceed 4000 strokes for one 
shoulder in a single workout, making swimming a common source of shoulder 
pathology (Tovin, 2006).   
Epidemiologic studies have consistently noted a high incidence and prevalence of 
shoulder pain and dysfunction in competitive swimmers with the prevalence reported 
to be between 12% and 91% (Beach et al., 1992; McMaster et al., 1998; Puckree & 
Thomas, 2006; Bansal et al., 2007; Wolf et al., 2009; Sein et al., 2010; Tate et al., 
2012) and incidence between 10% and 69% (Beach et al., 1992; McMaster & Troup, 
1993).  Repetitive micro trauma or overuse account for most injuries in swimming 
athletes, and with successful management usually do not require surgical intervention 
(McMaster, 1996). 
McMaster (1999) further stated that shoulder pain is not only the most common 
complaint for swimmers it also has a high potential to have an impact on a swimmer’s 
ability to compete.  It has been suggested that swimmers with interfering shoulder pain 
might not progress in training and will therefore not compete as effectively (McMaster 
& Troup, 1993), and injuries to the shoulder can be devastating (McMaster, 1999).  
Shoulder problems under the swimming population resemble that of the disabled 
thrower’s shoulder, but the clinical findings associated dysfunctions are not quite the 
same (Bak, 2010).  Swimmers with shoulder pain should therefore be evaluated and 
2 
 treated as a separate clinical entity, aimed toward underlying pathology and 
dysfunction (Bak, 2010). 
 Problem Statement 
The reasons for the high incidence and prevalence of shoulder injuries under 
swimmers are probably not singular, and as result there seems to be no single 
identifiable clinical entity of ‘swimmer’s shoulder’ (McMaster, 1996).  Although there is 
a substantial amount of information on risk factors for shoulder injuries in swimmers, 
up to date information on the correlation between specific freestyle stroke 
biomechanics and shoulder injuries seem to be few and wide spread. 
 Objectives of the Study 
McMaster (1996) postulated that many injuries originate from faulty techniques or 
mechanisms, and an assessment of injured athletes’ biomechanics must be made to 
identify factors that may contribute to injury. 
From of the literature freestyle pathomechanics correlating with shoulder injury 
include: 
 Hand entry: 
o that crosses the midline of the long axis of the body (Johnson et al. , 
2003); 
o further from the midline and thus lateral to the shoulder (Scovazzo et al., 
1991); 
o with the thumb first (Johnson et al., 2003); 
 Shoulder hyperflexion at the end of hand entry (Yanai & Hay, 1998; Yanai et 
al., 2000; Becker & Havriluk, 2012); 
 A dropped elbow during the early pull through phase (Yanai & Hay, 1998); 
 An inability to generate force during the late pull through phase causing an 
increase in force development during the vulnerable early pull through phase 
of the contralateral arm (Pink & Tibone, 2000); 
 Swimming catch-up stroke (Becker & Havriluk, 2012). 
Therefore, the objectives of this study are to: 
3 
 1. Determine the shoulder injury prevalence at the University of the Free State’s 
swimming club (Kovsie Aquatics), during the 2014/2015 swimming season. 
2. Investigate if a correlation between certain freestyle biomechanical hand and 
arm positions and shoulder injuries amongst swimmers from the latter 
swimming club exist. 
 Hypothesis 
The hypothesis for this study is: 
 There is a correlation between certain freestyle biomechanical hand and arm 
positions (pathomechanics) and shoulder injuries amongst swimmers from the 
Kovsie Aquatics swimming club.

 2 CHAPTER TWO: Literature Review 
The high volume of training involved in competitive swimming result in cumulative 
overload injuries (Rodeo, 1999).  Competitive swimmers practice 6 to 7 days a week 
and swim on average between 10 000 and 14 000m each day (Sein et al., 2010).  Most 
injuries and complaints encountered in swimming athletes are repetitive micro trauma 
or overuse, and successful management does not usually require surgical intervention 
(McMaster, 1996). 
 Epidemiology of Injuries  
Swimming has a distinct profile of injuries and medical conditions (Kammer et al., 
1999).  Common problems seen among swimmers include ‘swimmers shoulder’, an 
overuse injury that causes inflammation of the supraspinatus and/or the biceps brachii 
tendon (Kammer et al., 1999).  Measurement of prevention of sports injuries cannot 
be done in isolation.  They form part of what might be called a ‘sequence of prevention’ 
(Figure 2-1; van Mechelen et al., 1992). 
 
Figure 2-1  The sequence of prevention of sports injuries 
According to van Mechelen et al. (1992) the problem should firstly be identified and 
described in terms of incidence and severity of sports injuries.  Then the factors and 
mechanisms that play a part in the occurrence of sports injuries should be identified.  
The third step is to introduce measures that are likely to reduce the future risk and/or 
severity of sports injuries.  The measure should be based on the aetiological factors 1.  Establish the 
extend of the sports 
injury problem:                                        
* incidence                               
* severity              
2.  Establishing 
aetiology and 
mechanisms of 
injuries.
3.  Introducing 
preventive measures.4.  Assessing their 
effectivenes by 
repeating step 1.
5 
 and the mechanisms as identified in the second step.  Finally, the effect of the measure 
must be evaluated by repeating the first step (Van Mechelen et al., 1992)  
 The Prevalence and Incidence of Shoulder Injuries in Freestyle 
Four strokes are recognized in competitive swimming: freestyle, butterfly, backstroke, 
and breaststroke (Wanivenhaus et al., 2012).  Regardless of the stroke performed in 
competition, swimmers spend a considerable time swimming freestyle (Wanivenhaus 
et al., 2012).  Kammer et al. (1999) enumerated that irrespective of the swimmers’ 
speciality, 75% to 90% of training is done in freestyle. 
An exceptionally low prevalence (3%) of shoulder pain was reported in competitive 
Canadian swimmers (Kennedy & Hawkins, 1974).  More recent studies reported the 
prevalence and incidence of shoulder injuries ranging from 17% to 91% (Beach et al., 
1992; McMaster & Troup, 1993; McMaster et al., 1998; Puckree & Thomas, 2006; 
Bansal et al., 2007; Wolf et al., 2009; Sein et al., 2010; Tate et al., 2012). 
Wolf et al. (2009) not only found freestyle to be the most common stroke, it was also 
associated with the highest total number of injuries in their five-year survey of 94 
National College Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I swimmers from the University 
of Iowa.  The region most often injured by both male and female swimmers, was the 
shoulder and upper arm, which accounted for 31% and 36% respectively of the injuries 
in each group.  Shoulder injuries were the most frequent injury to result in lost time 
(Wolf et al., 2009).   
In a cross sectional study done on a group of 80 elite swimmers, 43 (54%) reported 
unilateral shoulder pain, and 30 (37%) others reported bilateral shoulder pain (Sein et 
al., 2010).  Thus 73 (91%) of the swimmers included, presented with shoulder pain 
and only the remaining seven swimmers (9%) stated they had no shoulder pain.  Thirty 
five per cent of the swimmers specialized in freestyle and ninety per cent of the 80 
swimmers spent more than 50% of their training time in freestyle (Sein et al., 2010).  
The authors concluded that the injury risk for shoulder pain doubled if swim training 
exceeded 15 hours per week, and swimmers were four times as likely to have shoulder 
pain if swimming distance topped 35 km per week (Sein et al., 2010). 
Sixty-four per cent (64%) of the usable respondents’ questionnaires, from Kwazulu 
Natal South Africa, reported actual shoulder injuries (Puckree & Thomas, 2006).

 These included impingement, supraspinatus and bicipital tendonitis, bursitis and 
muscle strain (Puckree & Thomas, 2006).  The majority (70%) of the swimmers 
attributed their injuries to freestyle, which they swam most of the time (Puckree & 
Thomas, 2006).  Similar to the results above, Beach et al. (1992) indicated that 87% 
of their 32 Division I swimmers experienced shoulder pain in their lifespan, while 69% 
experienced some degree of shoulder pain at the time of this study.  Thirty one percent 
of the swimmers reported shoulder pain that was affecting their swimming ability 
(Beach et al., 1992). 
Bansal et al. (2007) found a prevalence of shoulder impingement syndrome at 17% in 
their study of 161 male competitive swimmers.  McMaster and Troup (1993) concluded 
that an incidence of about 10% in age group swimmers, 13% of senior development 
swimmers and 26% of the elite team swimmers experienced current interfering 
shoulder pain.  The prevalence of a shoulder injury seems to be higher at 47% for age 
group, 66% for senior development and 73% for elite (McMaster & Troup, 1993).  
Thirty five percent (14 swimmers) noted significant interfering shoulder pain to be 
present at the time of assessment in their study on 40 senior national and elite 
swimmers (McMaster et al., 1998). 
The inconsistent findings may be due to the different study designs used (retrospective 
vs. prospective), and the definition of the severity of the injury.  For instance, Wolf et 
al. (2009) defined an injury as: “...any musculoskeletal problem suffered as a 
consequence of team related activity that resulted in a visit to an athletic trainer or 
physician”, whereas McMaster and Troup (1993) defined a shoulder injury as: “that 
which interfered with training or progress in training as opposed to post exercise 
muscle soreness”.  Notwithstanding, the high incidence and/or prevalence of shoulder 
injuries in swimmers, the literature is beset with controversy surrounding its aetiology. 
 Aetiology of Overuse Injuries 
Overuse injuries are thought to be the predominant injury type in sports that involve 
long, monotonous training sessions, for example, cycling, swimming and long-
distance running, as well as in technical sports that involve the repetition of similar 
movement patterns such as throwing and jumping (Clarsen et al., 2013). 
7 
 
 Definition of an Overuse Injury 
In the consensus statements, an overuse injury is defined as “an injury caused by 
repetitive microtrauma, without a single identifiable event responsible for the injury” 
(Fuller et al., 2006).  Bahr (2009) reported that overuse injuries have also been defined 
as ‘gradual onset injuries’, while Knight (2008) defined overuse injuries as: “Injuries 
caused by low-intensity forces of long duration.”  The classification of acute and 
overuse injuries is simple in most cases, but sometimes it may not be that obvious 
(Bahr, 2009).  Occasionally symptoms may have a sudden onset, but in actuality the 
injury is a result from a long-term process.  Bahr (2009) further remarked the cause of 
overuse injuries to be repetitive low-grade forces exceeding the tolerance of tissues.  
Figure 2-2. Profile of chronic micro traumatic soft tissue injuryillustrates the 
pathological process that is often under way for a period of time before the athlete 
notices the symptoms (Leadbetter, 1992).  If this process continues, the ability of the 
tissue to repair and adapt, can be exceeded, resulting in a clinical overuse injury with 
symptoms (Bahr, 2009). 
 
Figure 2-2. Profile of chronic micro traumatic soft tissue injury (Leadbetter, 
1992) 
According to Fredberg and Stengaard-Pedersen's (2008) review article it seems 
possible that tendons have a baseline mechanical strength, which are dependent on 
the loading history of the tendon (training level).  Abate et al. (2009) remarked that 

8 
 exercise increases the strength of the tendon, but when the individual threshold is 
overcome, micro-damage may occur.  The tendon may not be able to adapt fast 
enough after a rapid increase in training load, frequency, or duration (Fredberg & 
Stengaard-Pedersen, 2008) or have inadequate recovery time (Abate et al., 2009).  
The mechanical strength of the tendon may be exceeded, and a small injury may 
occur.  As a normal part of tendon remodelling and under normal circumstances, this 
small injury will heal (Fredberg & Stengaard-Pedersen, 2008).  If the training and 
overloading continues, these small injuries result in progressive tendon changes that, 
after an asymptomatic period of several months, slowly aggravate and finally reach 
the pain limit and become symptomatic as depicted in Figure 2-3 (Fredberg & 
Stengaard-Pedersen, 2008). 
 
Figure 2-3.  The 'Iceberg' Effect (Fredberg & Stangaard-Pederson, 2008) 

9 
  
Figure 2-4.  The 'Iceberg' Effect 
Abate et al. (2009) contends that a very thin line divides healthy and non-healthy 
physical exercise (Figure 2-4).  When athletes resume sporting activities after an 
inadequate rehabilitation period, during which pain recedes to just below the detection 
threshold while most of the intra-tendinous abnormalities still exist, the ‘iceberg theory’ 
explains the frequent relapse of symptoms. 
 Overuse Shoulder Injuries in the Swimming Shoulder 
Overuse injuries occur mostly in endurance sports that require long training sessions 
and include monotonous routine (such as swimming, long-distance running, cycling 
and cross-country skiing), and in more technical sports, which include a large number 
of repetitive movements of same kind (i.e. tennis, high jumping and weight lifting), 
(Bahr, 2009). 
Swim training involves repetitive overhead movement (Sein et al., 2010).  In a 
competitive training program a swimmer can easily log up to a million arm strokes per 
year (McMaster, 1999) and can exceed 4000 strokes for one shoulder in a single 
workout, making swimming a common source of shoulder pathology (Tovin, 2006).  
Most of the swimming propulsive force is derived from the arms, with the legs adding 
stabilization as well as propulsive force (McMaster, 1996).  King (1995) suggests that 
80% of the propulsion power is derived from the pull and 20% from the kick during 
freestyle.  Considering the above, it is not surprising that repetitive micro trauma or 
overuse account for most injuries in swimming athletes (McMaster, 1996), but not all 
swimmers who train under similar conditions develop significant interfering shoulder 

10 
 pain.  The reasons for this are probably not singular, and as result there seems to be 
no single identifiable clinical entity of ‘swimmer’s shoulder’ (McMaster, 1996). 
 Causes of Shoulder Pain in Swimmers 
According to Sein et al. (2010) a clear consensus as to the cause of shoulder pain in 
swimmers is lacking.  Bak (2010) stated that the significant challenge lies in identifying 
which of the following is the root cause of shoulder injuries: scapular dysfunction, 
anterior instability, or tendinopathy.  Sein et al. (2010) nominated supraspinatus 
tendinopathy (i.e. supraspinatus tendinosis or tendonitis) as another candidate cause 
of swimmer’s shoulder. 
Contrary to this ‘one factor as the root cause’ approach, Meeuwisse (1994) suggested 
a multifactorial approach (Figure 2-5) to advance the understanding of athletic injury, 
and could be used to assess the aetiology or causation thereof.  This multifactorial 
model attempted to account for the interaction of multiple risk factors, both 
internal/intrinsic and external/extrinsic (Meeuwisse et al., 2007).  It highlighted the 
importance of examining intrinsic predisposing factors as well as extrinsic factors that 
interact to make an athlete susceptible to injury, before an injury-inciting event occurs 
(Meeuwisse et al., 2007).   
 
Figure 2-5.  Multifactorial model of athletic injury aetiology 
Bahr and Krosshaug (2005) noted that especially for overuse injuries, the inciting 
event can sometimes be distant from the outcome.  As an example, for a stress 
fracture in a long distance runner, the inciting event is usually not the single training 
session when pain became evident (referring to Figure 2-5), but the training and 

11 
 competition programme he or she has followed over the previous weeks or months 
(Bahr & Krosshaug, 2005).  Until a complete description is available which includes 
information on all the contributing factors, it may be difficult to predict which factors 
may be modifiable through intervention (Bahr & Krosshaug, 2005). 
After considering all of the above it seems logical that a critical step in the sequence 
(Figure 2-1) is to establish the causes (Bahr & Krosshaug, 2005).  According to the 
latter authors this includes obtaining information on why a particular athlete may be at 
risk in a given situation (i.e. identify modifiable intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors), and 
how injuries happen (injury mechanisms/inciting events).   
Bahr and Krosshaug (2005) used Meeuwisse’s multifactorial model and applied it to 
Anterior Cruciate Ligament and therefore acute injuries (Figure 2-6). 
 
Figure 2-6.  Comprehensive model for injury causation 
(BMD - Body Mass Index; ROM - Range of Motion)  
Meeuwisse et al. (2007) elaborated on these previous models, and proposed an 
updated version.  In a real-life sporting environment, a participant’s risks are dynamic 
and can change frequently, where one exposure can alter an athlete’s intrinsic risk 
factors and change their predisposition to injury (Meeuwisse et al., 2007).  The athlete 
can then be exposed to the same or different extrinsic risk factors and have a different 

12 
 susceptibility (Meeuwisse et al., 2007).  This paints a recursive picture where an 
athlete can enter a given athletic event cyclically with a differing set of risk factors even 
though most other elements of the athlete and playing environment may remain 
constant (Meeuwisse et al., 2007).   
In 2007 the model seen in Figure 2-7 was proposed by Meeuwisse et al. (2007).  It is 
recursive in that one exposure can alter risk factors and allow the athlete to cycle 
through the model repeatedly.  Aside from the possibility of retirement from sport, this 
model can be seen to operate independent of outcome (Meeuwisse et al., 2007). 
Figure 2-7.  A dynamic recursive model of the aetiology of sport injuries 
The contributing modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors (both internal and external) 
in swimming can be illustrated by adopting and modifying the model proposed by 
Meeuwisse et al. (2007).  This will illustrate the contribution and interaction of these 
risk factors in terms of shoulder injuries in swimmers and enable the healthcare 
professional to identify risk factors and manage modifiable risk factors.  By means of 
elimination the best management strategy of the shoulder injury and injury risk can be 
facilitated. 
 Defining the Term ‘Swimmer’s Shoulder’ 

13 
 The term “Swimmer’s Shoulder” was first introduced by Kennedy and Hawkins in 1974 
(Kennedy & Hawkins, 1974).  This term has been applied to a variety of complaints 
involving pain in the shoulders of competitive swimmers without specific reference to 
cause (McMaster et al., 1998).  According to Allegrucci et al. (1994) ‘Swimmer’s 
Shoulder’ can be related to pathology of the acromioclavicular joint, rotator cuff, long 
head of the biceps brachii, glenoïd labrum, or any form of shoulder instability.  Brushøj  
et al. (2007) added that this term covers a variety of pathologies including labral 
wearing and sub-acromial impingement.  Tovin (2006) suggested that ‘swimmer’s 
shoulder’ is a musculoskeletal condition that results in symptoms in the area of the 
lateral aspect of the shoulder, sometimes confined to the subacromial region.   
Conversely, Van Dorssen et al. (2014) suggested that this term is nondescript and a 
confusing catch all term which does not really advance our understanding.  The latter 
authors further contended that this term ought to be replaced by an individualised and 
more specific diagnosis.  It should account for individual contributing factors (intrinsic 
and extrinsic) and suspected pathology of each injured swimmer.  This will allow for a 
clearer approach and tailored treatment (van Dorssen et al., 2014).   
Pink and Tibone (2000) suggested that global pain experience by swimmers has led 
clinicians to make global diagnoses, such as swimmer’s shoulder.  They attribute the 
creation of this catch all term to the delay of the swimmer to report the injury as soon 
as symptoms are experienced.  Failing to do this causes inflammation to set in, 
causing a more global pain, and masking the inciting symptoms (Pink & Tibone, 2000).  
The reaction to this was non-specific treatment with limited success as demonstrated 
by the fact that more than half of shoulder injuries in swimmers recur (Pink & Tibone, 
2000). 
 Pathologies Associated with ‘Swimmer’s Shoulder’ 
Allegrucci et al. (1994) suggested that although the term ‘swimmer’s shoulder’ is not 
an accurate clinical diagnosis, it discloses the fact that swimmers place high demands 
on their shoulders.  The following section outlines pathologies associated with 
‘swimmer’s shoulder’. 
14 
 
 Subacromial Impingement 
The impingement of subacromial structures has been proposed as a major cause of 
shoulder problems that often occur among freestyle swimmers (Yanai & Hay, 1998).  
Impingement refers to the mechanical phenomenon in which contact between the 
greater tuberosity of the humerus and the acromial arch creates compressive force on 
the sub-acromial structures (Brushøj et al., 2007).  Shoulder impingement and 
instability are two of the most common dysfunctions discussed in overhand athletes 
according to Allegrucci et al. (1994).  Primary impingement can be defined as 
impingement caused by outlet stenosis in the subacromial space in a stable shoulder 
(Sorenson & Jorgenson, 2000).  However, Wanivenhaus et al. (2012) explained that 
impingement in the competitive swimmer is typically caused by altered kinematics due 
to muscle fatigue or laxity rather than subacromial pathological changes, which are 
observed in other patient populations.  This secondary form of impingement can be 
defined as impingement secondary to glenohumeral instability (Sorenson & 
Jorgenson, 2000).   
Subacromial or intra-articular impingement may occur in various positions during the 
swimming stroke (Wanivenhaus et al., 2012).  In the case of subacromial 
impingement, the bursal surface of the rotator cuff impinges against the anteroinferior 
acromion, while in intra-articular impingement, the rotator cuff tendons and/or biceps 
tendon impinges on the anterosuperior glenoid and labrum (Wanivenhaus et al., 
2012). 
 Supraspinatus Tendinopathy 
Swim volume-induced supraspinatus tendinopathy with associated supraspinatus 
tendon thickening may be an intrinsic factor for development of swimmer’s shoulder 
(Sein et al., 2010). 
 Risk Factors 
Given the prevalence of shoulder injuries under swimmers, numerous risk factors for 
shoulder injury in swimmers are proposed in the literature (van Dorssen et al., 2014). 
 
Risk factors in sport are any factors that may increase the potential for injury (Emery, 
2003).  Risk factors may be intrinsic (age, conditioning etc.) or extrinsic (weather, field, 
conditions etc.) to the individual participating in the sport (Emery, 2003).  The latter 
15 
 author further explained that modifiable risk factors refer to those that have the 
potential to be altered to reduce injury rates.  Risk factors that cannot be altered are 
referred to as non-modifiable risk factors and may affect the relationship between 
modifiable risk factors and injury.  Identification of these factors will assist in defining 
high-risk populations (Emery, 2003). 
However, Bak (2010) stated that the aetiology of swimmer’s shoulder related to 
intrinsic and extrinsic factors, and these factors are listed below in Table 2-1. 
 
Table 2-1  Aetiology of swimmer's shoulder 
Extrinsic Factors Intrinsic Factors 
Training volume – absolute and sudden 
increases Excessive laxity/general joint 
hypermobility 
Technical Errors Isolated joint hyperlaxity 
Hand paddles Posture, core stability, and increased 
thoracic kyphosis 
Scapular dyskinesis 
Glenohumeral internal rotation deficit 
(G.I.R.D.) 
Rotator cuff imbalance 
Lack of flexibility/stiffness (posterior 
capsule, anterior capsule, anterior cuff, 
and pectoralis minor) 
 Non-modifiable Intrinsic Risk Factors 
2.7.1.1 Age 
Tate et al. (2012) reported high school swimmers to be most symptomatic in their study 
of 236 female swimmers between 8 and 77 years of age.  According to Puckree and 
Thomas (2006) swimmers between the ages of 15 and 16 years were significantly 
more injured compared with the other age categories. 
16 
 2.7.1.2 Gender 
In the study done by Mountjoy et al. (2010) during the 13th FINA World Championships 
2009, female athletes had a higher risk of injury than male athletes. However, contrary 
to this, Ristolainen et al. (2009) found no correlation between risk of injury and gender. 
2.7.1.3 Combination of Age and Gender 
Becker (2011) reported that swimmer’s shoulder syndromes, under female swimmers, 
are likely to occur approximately three times over a career span: 
 The first occurrence is usually during early to mid-adolescence when the body 
weight is likely to increase and arm strength is not fully developed while the 
swimmer is moving to a higher age group. 
 The second period is in the later stages of high school competition.  Although 
the body weight is almost settled, the upper body is not sufficiently strong 
enough to withstand the harder training. 
 The third period is during the transition from high school to college swimming.  
Collegiate swimming often entails dramatic increases in training volume and 
intensity.  
Becker (2011) further suggested that in males, two peak times for onset of injury occur: 
 First, at the end of the second growth spurt, when the body size increases but 
shoulder muscles are not yet developed. 
 The second time when injury occurs is the high training point of the freshman 
year, when the yardage exceeds previous distances and these increases occur 
over a period of a few days. 
It seems evident that some of the risk factors associated with shoulder injuries in the 
developing body is a lack of strength due to growth (or in increase in body weight 
without a subsequent immediate increase in strength) and an increase in training 
volume and/or intensity.  Even though age and gender are not modifiable, the 
prevention of shoulder injuries in swimmers lies in identifying those at risk, and 
managing them accordingly.  Strength is a modifiable risk factor and shoulder injuries 
can, according to Becker (2011), be prevented if dry land strengthening programs are 
initiated.  Training volume and intensity should also be manipulated to manage 
swimmers at risk of shoulder injury, and ensure pain free swimming participation. 
17 
 Abgarov et al. (2012) concluded in a study on 170 University swimmers, where he 
found that the earlier males start swimming, the greater their risk of acquiring a 
swimming related injury, thus supporting the notion that an early start (i.e., early 
specialization) predisposes males to more injuries during their swimming careers. 
2.7.1.4 Previous Shoulder Injury 
Alarmingly, Walker et al. (2012) stated that the recurrence of shoulder injuries in 
swimming is frequent.  Exploring the literature, there seem to be a significant 
independent association between a positive past history of shoulder injury and 
subsequent shoulder injury risk (Walker  et al., 2012; Abgarov et al., 2012).  These 
authors further reported that swimmers with a history of interfering shoulder pain were 
4.1 times more likely to sustain a recurring injury.  In the same study, swimmers with 
a history of significant shoulder injury were 11.3 times more likely to sustain a recurring 
injury.  
To conclude, a history of shoulder injury is a non-modifiable risk factor, but it can be 
used as a marker to identify swimmers at risk of injury and preventative efforts should 
be implemented (Walker et al., 2012). 
 Modifiable Intrinsic Risk Factors 
Bansal et al. (2007) avers that intrinsic risk factors significantly associated with 
shoulder impingement syndrome in swimmers include atraumatic anterior instability, 
past history of shoulder pain and inadequate treatment.  The onset of symptoms may 
be associated with impaired posture, glenohumeral joint mobility, neuromuscular 
control, or muscle performance (Tovin, 2006).  Following are potentially modifiable 
intrinsic risk factors as described in the literature. 
2.7.2.1 Scapular Dyskinesis 
Scapular dyskinesis is seen in the majority of overhead athlete’s shoulder with overuse 
pain syndromes and may be caused by an inhibition on activation patterns of the 
scapula stabilising muscles (i.e. serratus anterior and subscapularis etc.), (Burkhart et 
al., 2003; Bak, 2010).  During activity, patients with shoulder pain and symptoms, the 
scapula is placed in a more abducted, protracted, and laterally displaced position than 
in symptom free subjects (Bak, 2010). 
18 
 According to Cools et al. (2003) overhead athletes presenting with impingement 
symptoms showed a delay in muscle activation of the middle and lower trapezius 
muscle and a lack of coordination between the different trapezius muscle parts (upper, 
middle, and lower). 
2.7.2.2 Shoulder Laxity 
Proper joint mechanics necessitates gleno-humeral stability, and it’s absence is 
associated with significant disability (McMaster et al., 1998).  The latter authors further 
elaborated the degree of inherent shoulder laxity to be a common denominator in the 
aquatic athlete with interfering shoulder pain.  While pathologic shoulder laxity may be 
unidirectional, it is often multi directional in swimmers.  The superior migration of the 
humeral head may lead to secondary definable causes of shoulder pain such as 
impingement (McMaster et al., 1998).  The latter authors also found a significant 
correlation between clinical score of glenohumeral joint laxity and interfering shoulder 
pain in senior national and elite swimmers.  Sein et al. (2010), however, contends that 
repetitive swimming does not increase shoulder joint laxity and doubts that joint laxity 
is the major contributor to swimmer’s shoulder.  They found the high incidence of 
tendinopathy to relate with the time spent in training (hours swum per week) and 
distance per week. 
In their review study Heinlein and Cosgarea (2010) compared studies that correlated 
gleno-humeral joint laxity with shoulder pain to studies that found no significant 
association.  The study indicated that the literature was inconclusive on whether gleno-
humeral joint laxity is a primary cause of pain (Heinlein & Cosgarea, 2010). 
2.7.2.3 Shoulder Instability 
Allegrucci et al. (1994) suggested that glenohumeral instability can develop from 
disruption of static stabilizers (ligaments, labrum, and capsule) or fatigue or weakness 
of the dynamic stabilizers (musculature).  Secondary impingement can therefore be 
caused by rotator cuff dysfunction (i.e. fatigue or injury) or as a result of instability due 
to lax static stabilisers (Allegrucci et al., 1994). 
2.7.2.4 Range of Motion 
It is possible that swimmers with limited shoulder external rotation who performed their 
stroke at the end of their available range of motion are at an increased risk of 
impingement during arm recovery, particularly in the presence of overuse related 
19 
 tendon thickening (Walker et al., 2012).  In the same study, swimmers with greater 
external rotation were also at increased risk of shoulder injury.  This might be explained 
by the compromised ability of the passive structures to provide stability and detrimental 
changes in the neuromuscular control of the active stabilizing musculature like the 
subscapularis (Walker et al., 2012).  According to the latter authors swimmers with 
shoulder external range of motion (ROM) of more than 100º or less than 93º were at 
an increased risk of developing a shoulder injury than those with mid-range motion.  
This supports the hypothesis by Blanch (2004) who avers that there is a ‘window’ of 
optimal shoulder ROM.  Walker et al. (2012) further remarked that the literature 
frequently describes that the loss of internal rotation ROM is due to tightness of the 
posterior capsule but found no correlation between internal rotation ROM and 
swimming shoulder injuries. 
2.7.2.5 Muscle Imbalance 
EMG analysis on swimmers with painful shoulders revealed that the most prominent 
abnormality is a weakness of the serratus anterior and increased activity of the 
rhomboids major and minor during the pull by Pink et al. (1991). The resulting 
mechanical imbalance ("floating scapula") increases anterior impingement of the 
biceps brachii and supraspinatus. 
Based on the EMG (with fine wire electrodes) findings of 14 Collegiate and Masters 
Swimmers while swimming freestyle, Scovazzo et al. (1991) found the following 
differences between swimmers with painful shoulders and those with normal 
shoulders: 
 Hand Entry - Significantly less muscle activity in the rhomboids, upper 
trapezius, middle and anterior deltoids in the swimmers with painful shoulders. 
 Pulling - Significantly less activity in the serratus anterior and significantly more 
in the rhomboids in those subjects with painful shoulders. At the exact time that 
the serratus anterior was dysfunctioning and exhibiting abnormally low levels 
of activity, the rhomboids were exhibiting significantly more in the painful 
shoulder. 
 Hand Exit and Early recovery – Significantly less muscle activity in the anterior 
and middle deltoids and significantly more in the infraspinatus in the group with 
20 
 painful shoulders.  The infraspinatus externally rotates the humerus to avoid 
the painful internal rotation. 
 Mid-recovery – significantly less muscle action in the subscapularis for the 
swimmers with painful shoulders. 
Scovazzo et al. (1991) found no difference in the muscle firing pattern, nor amplitude, 
between swimmers with painful and normal shoulders in the posterior deltoid, 
supraspinatus, teres minor, pectoralis major, or latissimus dorsi during the freestyle 
stroke. 
2.7.2.6 Fatigue 
According to Tovin (2006) symptoms that develop as a result of fatigue can also affect 
stroke mechanics.  The author further elaborated that the proposed mechanism of 
failure concerning the swimming shoulder joint, is initiated with fatigue. 
The serratus anterior in the healthy shoulder stabilizes the scapula in upward rotation 
and protraction (Tovin, 2006).  This position of upward rotation and protraction avoids 
impingement of the biceps brachii tendon and rotator cuff by creating adequate 
subacromial space (under the coraco-acromial arch) for the biceps brachii tendon and 
rotator cuff to move (Scovazzo et al., 1991).  It also aids in maintaining a good 
approximation between the humeral head and the glenoid fossa (Tovin, 2006).  Once 
the scapula is in position, at the beginning of the pull through, it effectively reverses 
the origin and the insertion and is used to pull the body over the arm.  If the serratus 
anterior fatigues, it would not be able to add this propulsive motion (Scovazzo et al., 
1991).  They also found a difference in muscle activity (as measured with a fine wire 
EMG) between painful and normal shoulders. During the pull through, the serratus 
anterior in the painful shoulders were not as active as it was in the normal shoulders 
(Scovazzo et al., 1991).  Pink et al. (1991) agreed that the subscapularis and serratus 
anterior are active throughout the stroke cycle in freestyle swimming, and therefore 
susceptible to fatigue. 
2.7.2.7 Flexibility 
According to  Tovin (2006) the cause of primary impingement is usually a tight 
posterior capsule (causing the humeral head to migrate anteriorly) or abnormal 
acromial morphology.  The author elaborated that primary impingement syndrome is 
less common than secondary impingement in competitive swimmers.  Tate et al. 
21 
 (2012) found a reduced latissimus dorsi flexibility in symptomatic young swimmers, 
whereas pectoralis minor tightness and decreased core endurance were associated 
with symptoms in swimmers aged 12 years and more. 
 Non-Modifiable Extrinsic Risk Factors 
Risk factors in sport are any factors that may increase the potential for injury 
(Meeuwisse, 1991).  Risk factors may be intrinsic (age, conditioning etc.) or extrinsic 
(weather, field, conditions etc.) to the individual participating in the sport (Emery, 
2003).  Risk factors that cannot be altered are referred to as non-modifiable risk factors 
and may affect the relationship between modifiable risk factors and injury (Emery, 
2003). The following section shines some light on non-modifiable extrinsic risk factors 
associated with swimming. 
2.7.3.1 Speciality (distance vs. sprint) 
According to Puckree and Thomas (2006) it seems evident that distance speciality 
may play a role.  In their study the majority of specialist sprinters (70%), regardless of 
gender, complained of shoulder injuries compared with long-distance swimmers.  
Contrary to this, Wolf et al. (2009) reported that the risk of suffering an injury was not 
significantly different between sprinters and distance swimmers. 
 Inciting Events 
Training errors such as overuse, misuse, abuse or disuse may contribute to shoulder 
pain in swimmers (Tovin, 2006).  Following are some training factors that might incite 
an injury. 
2.7.4.1 Excessive Increase in Exercise Volume 
Work in other sports suggest that week-on-week increases in load of up to 10% can 
largely be tolerated, but increases beyond this are associated with a linear increase in 
injury incidence (van Dorssen et al., 2014).   
The main factor in the development of a swimmer’s shoulder seems to be the high 
training volume, during growth, in the absence of a well-designed and balanced 
dryland training program (Bak, 2010).  This affects the muscular balance of the core, 
the scapulothoracic articulation, the rotator cuff, and glenohumeral mobility (Bak, 
2010).  The author expressed that swimmers often report that their shoulder pain was 
22 
 related to an increase in the amount of training, typically during a training camp or in 
conjunction with advancement to a higher training level. 
Pink and Tibone (2000) suggested that the two factors that appeared to provoke 
shoulder pain is an increase in the intensity and distance of the workout.  In line with 
the above mentioned, Wolf et al. (2009) reported that freshmen had the highest total 
number of injuries and the highest mean number of injuries per swimmer when 
compared to the sophomore, junior and senior populations in their study.  The authors 
proposed the high prevalence of injuries during the early college years are likely to be 
explained by the transition from high school training regimens to that of collegiate level.  
The increase in swimming yardage and the additional cross-training activities are often 
substantially greater than what an athlete was accustomed to, and can lead to 
overuse-type injuries early in a swimmer’s college career (Wolf et al., 2009).  They 
further remarked that fewer injuries are experienced as the swimmer becomes 
accustomed to the yardage and workout routine. 
In their study on the cause of shoulder injuries in swimmers, Sein et al. (2010) found 
that the incidence of supraspinatus tendinopathy was related to time spent training 
(hours swim per week) and distance swim per week. Out of the latter research 
swimmers who swam more than 15 hours per week were twice as likely to have 
tendinopathy as those who trained for less time.  Swimmers who swam more than 
35km per week were four times more likely than those who swam fewer kilometres 
(Sein et al., 2010). 
Besides these findings they further noted that a greater proportion of swimmers 
competing at a higher level of competition had an increased incidence of 
supraspinatus tendinopathy than swimmers at lower competitive levels.  These 
findings are supported by the findings of Tate et al. (2012) who found that high school 
swimmers practised on average 16 hours per week and had the highest prevalence 
(22.6%) of symptomatic shoulders.  The latter authors further proposed that shoulder 
pain, dissatisfaction and disability correlates positively with increased repetitive upper 
extremity usage in terms of swimming or water polo exposure for mature swimmers. 
To conclude, it seems evident that an excessive increase in exercise volume or 
additional exercise (i.e. dry land training etc.) might play a significant role in the 
prediction and/or prevention of overuse-type injuries. 
23 
 2.7.4.2 Taking Time off from the Sport 
Abgarov et al. (2012) found a negative effect for taking off from the sport of swimming.  
The expectation was that taking time off would reduce injury risk but found an 
increased risk of injury Instead.  Abgarov et al. (2012) further elaborated, that those 
athletes who took time off placed unrealistic expectations on themselves once they 
returned to the sport.  This attitude of attempting to make up for lost time and/or ‘catch- 
up’ to familiar swimmers, would increase the risk of injury as time off from the sport 
puts an athlete/swimmer behind with regards to their development or fitness levels. 
 Potentially Modifiable Extrinsic Factors 
Modifiable risk factors refer to those that have the potential to be altered by injury 
prevention strategies to reduce injury rates (Meeuwisse, 1991).  Risk factors may be 
intrinsic (age, conditioning etc.) or extrinsic (weather, field, conditions etc.) to the 
individual participating in the sport (Emery, 2003).  The following section defines some 
modifiable extrinsic risk factors associated with swimming. 
2.7.5.1 Paddle Swimming 
Hand paddles are used to increase resistance with the arm stroke (McMaster, 1999).  
This increase in resistance leads to an increase in the load, which often results in 
shoulder pain (McMaster, 1999).  Opposing this, Tate et al. (2012) did not find a 
correlation between hand paddle use in swimming and shoulder injury.  According to 
the authors this might be due to the change in paddle technology, from rectangular 
and solid in design, to a shape that conforms to the hand with holes to reduce 
resistance.  Paddle use itself might not elicit a shoulder injury, but excessive use of 
paddles might as seen by work done by Tovin (2006).  Abuse is defined as having 
excessive force going through normal tissues.  The example used is one of a swimmer 
who trains excessively with hand paddles, increasing strain on the shoulder (Tovin, 
2006). 
2.7.5.2 Technical Errors 
McMaster (1996) postulated that many injuries originate from faulty techniques or 
mechanisms, and an assessment of injured athletes’ biomechanics must be made to 
identify factors that may contribute to injury.  Some specific freestyle technical flaws 
heavily stress the shoulders and can lead to overuse (Kammer et al., 1999).  This will 
be the topic of discussion for the rest of this chapter. 
24 
 
 Freestyle Stroke Biomechanics  
McMaster et al. (1998) stated that mechanical efficiency is an important factor to excel 
at the sport of competitive swimming.  The swimming technique that produces the 
greatest distance per stroke at the most efficient energy use will produce the best 
result (McMaster et al.,1998).  Stroke mechanics not only seems important in injury 
prevention, but the energy cost of freestyle swimming (ml/m) appears to be strongly 
influenced by the swimmers lean body weight and the effective application of force 
during the arm stroke (Costill et al., 1985). 
Swimming is comprised of four different strokes of varying distances, including 
freestyle (sometimes referred to as the crawl), butterfly, backstroke, and breast stroke 
(van Dorssen et al., 2014).  The sport requires several different shoulder motions, most 
being performed during circumduction in clockwise and counter-clockwise directions 
with varying degrees of internal and external rotation and scapular protraction and 
retraction (Tovin, 2006).  Most swimming strokes consist of a pull-through phase that 
generates speed and a recovery phase where the arm is out of the water (Bak, 2010).  
One of the methods explaining freestyle stroke biomechanics is stated by Tovin (2006) 
where the stroke was divided into two primary phases referred to as the pull-through 
and recovery.  The propulsion is achieved during the pull-through which was further 
subdivided into different phases consisting of the hand entry, the catch, mid-pull, and 
finish or end pull-through (Tovin, 2006).  Figure 2-8 depicts the phases of swimming 
freestyle (Pink et al., 1991). 
 
Figure 2-8.  Phases of the freestyle swimming cycle 
The freestyle stroke pull-cycle can be divided in four phases (Fernándes et al., 2012): 

25 
 1. Early pull-through: beginning with the hand entry into the water and ending 
when the humerus is perpendicular to the axis of the torso. 
2. Late pull-through: beginning at the completion of early pull-through and ending 
as the hand leaves the water. 
3. Early recovery: beginning at hand exit and ending when the humerus is 
perpendicular to the water surface. 
4. Late recovery: beginning at the completion of early recovery and ending at hand 
entry. 
 Hand entry 
The hand usually enters the water close to the midline with the elbow above the 
surface of the water (Tovin, 2006).  According to Pink et al. (1991) the hand enters 
forward and lateral to the head, and medial to the shoulder.  The elbow is flexed, with 
the elbow above the hand, so that the fingers are the first to enter the water (Pink et 
al., 1991).  Johnson et al. (2003) advances that the hand should enter with the little 
finger or fingers first, and not the thumb first.  This technique will keep the swimmer in 
the impingement range for as short period as possible by avoiding excessive internal 
rotation (Johnson et al., 2003).  The hand then continues to ‘reach’ forward, below the 
surface of the water and towards (but not crossing) the midline of the body (Tovin, 
2006).  Becker and Havriluk (2012) suggests that at the completion of the arm entry 
the hand should be below shoulder level to minimise shoulder stress, maximise force 
generation, and optimise arm synchronisation.  This was similar to the work done by 
Yanai and Hay (1998) who suggested avoiding an impingement position during hand 
entry by a reduction of the elevation angle, and to resist the forcible elevation of the 
hand.  Figure 2-9 depicts hand entry during freestyle (Van Dorssen et al., 2014) 
26 
 Figure 2-9.  Hand entry 
 The Pull Through 
The underwater pull-through starts with the early pull-through phase, which is marked 
by the initiation of the backward arm movement (Pink et al., 1991).  The palm and 
forearm should face the backward direction with the fingertips pointing down for as 
long as possible.  Thus the shoulder is abducted and internally rotated during this 
phase (Yanai & Hay, 1998).  Johnson et al. (2003) suggested that the pull through 
should be done in a straight line, and not in a S-shape.  The point at which the humerus 
is perpendicular to the body is called the mid pull through (Pink et al., 1991).  Following 
mid pull-through is the late pull through (Pink et al., 1991).  During this phase the hand 
continues back and passes next to the hip until it exits the water, leading with the 
elbow (Pink et al., 1991). 
 Recovery 
During the recovery phase, the shoulder abducts and rotates externally as the arm is 
brought forward for arm entry (Yanai & Hay, 1998).  After the arm exits the water, the 
recovery phase begins, when the arm is swung above the water to bring the arm into 
position to enter once again (Pink et al., 1991).  Figure 2-10 illustrates recovery during 
freestyle swimming (Van Dorssen et al., 2014). 

27 
  
Figure 2-10.  The recovery phase 
 Functional Anatomy During Freestyle Swimming 
The shoulder complex is designed to achieve the greatest range of motion (ROM) with 
the most degrees of freedom of any joint system in the body.  At the glenohumeral 
joint, a complex ligamentous system contribute to primary stability and an 
musculotendinous system serves as secondary stabilisers (Tovin, 2006).  The author 
further noted that this support mechanism allows the shoulder to withstand large 
external forces, while providing enough mobility for the upper extremity to accomplish 
complex movement patterns. 
Johnson et al. (2003) reported the normal freestyle arm stroke with fine-needle 
electromyography (EMG) as follows:   
 The normal "catch" occurs when the forward hand enters the water as the upper 
trapezius elevates and the rhomboids retract the scapula.  The serratus anterior 
protracts, upward rotates the scapula, and is highly active from this point in the 
catch and through the pull.  These opposing actions hold the scapula in place.   
 Just after the catch, the pectoralis major fires and adducts and extends the 
humerus while internal rotation is balanced by the antagonistic external rotation 
of the teres minor.   
 The latissimus dorsi fires in concert with the subscapularis from the mid pull-
through until the beginning of recovery.  The deltoid and supraspinatus are the 
prime movers through recovery. 
Wanivenhaus et al. (2012) summarized the phases of the freestyle stroke, shoulder 
position, and muscle activation in the form of Table 2-2 below.  

28 
 Table 2-2.  Functional anatomy during freestyle swimming 
 Freestyle Pathomechanics 
McMaster (1996) postulated that many injuries originate from faulty techniques or 
mechanisms, and an assessment of injured athletes’ biomechanics must be made to 
identify factors that may contribute to injury.  Some specific freestyle technical flaws 
heavily stress the shoulders and can lead to overuse (Kammer et al., 1999).   
The impingement of sub-acromial structures has been proposed as a major cause of 
shoulder problems that often occur among freestyle swimmers (Yanai & Hay, 1998).  
In their study on 11 male College swimmers, Yanai and Hay (1998) found the mean 
duration of impingement positioning during freestyle swimming to be up to 24.8%, with 
14.4% of this occurring during pulling and 10.4% during recovery.  They found a 
considerable variability in the mean value for the percentage stroke time among 
subjects, and suggested that certain stroke techniques and/or physiques might be less 
vulnerable to shoulder impingement than others (Yanai & Hay, 1998). 
 Hand Entry Pathomechanics 
Swimmers with painful shoulders had a different pattern of hand entry than those with 
normal shoulders (Scovazzo et al., 1991).  According to them the hand entered further 
away from the midline, and the humerus was lower in the water.  This position is 
frequently described as a ‘dropped elbow’ position (Scovazzo et al., 1991).  They 
further noted that in this position (hand entry further from the midline) the scapula 
would not need to be upwardly rotated (associated with a weak serratus anterior) nor 
retracted as much.  This position of hand entry avoids the classic impingement position 
of flexion and internal humeral rotation (Scovazzo et al., 1991). 

29 
 Johnson et al. (2003) suggested that a hand entry that crosses the midline of the long 
axis, of the body, causes mechanical impingement in the anterior shoulder including 
the long head of the biceps and supraspinatus.  This is exacerbated by a thumb first 
entry which further stresses the biceps brachii attachment to the anterior glenoïd 
labrum (Johnson et al., 2003).  According to the latter authors, a crossover pull through 
usually results from a crossover entry, and increases the time in the impingement 
position. 
 Hand/Arm Position at the end of the Hand Entry Pathomechanics 
Yanai and Hay (1998) reported that the hydrodynamic force exerted on the hand 
during entry could forcibly elevate the arm beyond normal maximum active flexion, 
placing the shoulder in a position of hyperflexion, causing impingement.  In their study, 
this mechanism appeared to cause shoulder impingement for approximately 10% of 
the stroke time (Yanai & Hay, 1998).  In an effort to avoid this position Yanai and Hay 
(1998) suggest a reduction of the elevation angle, and to resist the forcible elevation 
of the hand.  They also remarked that at the point when the hand enters the water, the 
hydrodynamic force applied on the hand generates a large moment in the shoulder 
joint, causing elevation of the humeral head and subsequent impingement. 
In line with this, Becker and Havriluk (2012) found that an intentional effort to complete 
the arm entry with the arm parallel to the surface is a technique factor that contributes 
to an ineffective arm position, increases shoulder stress, minimal force production and 
gaps in propulsion.  Intentional maintenance of the arm in a position parallel to the 
surface (as in catch-up stroke), causes torso rotation to increase the time of exposure 
of the shoulder in a hyperflexed position, and exacerbates shoulder stress (Becker & 
Havriluk, 2012). 
 Early Pull Through Pathomechanics 
Bak (2010) proposed that the anterior capsulolabral complex and the posterior-
superior labrum are at risk of injury during the early pull-through.  One of the most 
commonly described technical faults in freestyle swimming is called the “dropped 
elbow” (Figure 2-11) and occurs during this phase (Yanai and Hay 1998).  Dropping 
the elbow constitutes increasing shoulder external rotation, in an attempt to avoid the 
painful internal rotation causing impingement (Richardson et al., 1980).  This position 
places the muscles of propulsion at a mechanical disadvantage (Richardson et al., 
1980).  It is still unknown whether the stroke alterations seen in swimmers with 
30 
 symptomatic shoulders are the cause or the consequence of pain (Heinlein & 
Cosgarea, 2010). 
 
Figure 2-11.  Schematics of a dropped elbow 
The dropped elbow pull involves a relatively large shoulder external rotation with 
horizontal adduction.According to Yanai and Hay (1998), Dr. Counsilman presented a 
sequence of arm positions during the pull phase to define the “dropped elbow” pull 
and the “correct high-elbow” pull (see Figure 2-11 above and Figure 2-12 below). 
 
Figure 2-12.  Schematics of the high-elbow pull 
The high-elbow pull appears to involve a combination of a relatively large shoulder 
internal rotation with horizontal abduction.  The “dropped-elbow” technique involves a 
combination of relatively large external rotation and horizontal abduction at the 
shoulder, and the correct “high-elbow” technique involves a combination of a large 
internal rotation and horizontal abduction).  Although the high-elbow technique is 
known to place the muscles used to generate the propulsive force at a mechanical 
advantage, it also tends to place the shoulder structures at risk because of 
impingement (Yanai & Hay, 1998).  In the high elbow pull position, the backward pull 
of the hand (in the early pull through phase) is initiated by the backward motion of the 
hand relative to the elbow, thus the hand moves backward while the elbow remains 
almost stationary. This backward motion of the hand relative to the elbow is associated 
with an increase in the internal rotation angle.  Swimmers who executed the pull phase 

31 
 with a large internal rotation angle of the arm had an increased susceptibility to 
impingement (Yanai & Hay, 1998).  Yanai and Hay (1998) recommended that 
swimmers should adopt the high-elbow technique during the pull phase only within 
their boundary ROM, so that the advantage of this technique can be obtained safely. 
 Late Pull Through Pathomechanics 
Pink and Tibone (2000) claims that a swimmer with a shoulder injury fails to generate 
force from that arm during the late pull through phase.  Therefore, the swimmer must 
rely on the contralateral arm to pull the body forward.  An increase in training intensity 
will therefore result in an increase in propulsive forces of the opposite hand during the 
early pull through phase. 
 Hand Exit Pathomechanics 
Scovazzo et al. (1991) reported that an early hand exit was associated with swimmers 
with painful shoulders.  An early exit was defined as an exit that occurred before the 
palm passed the thigh, with the elbow bent (Scovazzo et al., 1991).  They suggest that 
this is an attempt to avoid the extremes of internal rotation that accompany the more 
fully flexed elbow (Scovazzo et al., 1991).  Bak (2010) concluded that the 
supraspinatus tendon is at risk of injury during the late pull-through. 
 Recovery Phase 
Yanai and Hay (1998) stated that shoulder impingement was most often found during 
this phase of freestyle swimming.  Swimmers who spend the most stroke time in 
internal rotation (17 to 19% of their stroke time) had a recovery pattern where the 
elbow led the wrist and were likely to experience impingement (Yanai & Hay, 1998).  
The swimmers, who exhibited the least percentage of stroke time in internal rotation 
(0 to 3% of their stroke time) where the elbow barely preceded the wrist, were unlikely 
to experience impingement.  
A dropped elbow during the recovery phase was also associated with shoulder pain in 
Scovazzo et al. (1991) study on 14 Collegiate and Masters Swimmers.  They noted 
that by keeping the arm lower and shortening the arc of motion, these swimmers were 
avoiding the painful impingement position (Scovazzo et al., 1991).  The latter 
statement makes sense as a characteristic of the position eliciting subacromial 
impingement symptoms, is forward flexion and internal rotation of the glenohumeral 
32 
 joint during the recovery phase (above-water portion) of the stroke (Wanivenhaus et 
al., 2012). 
 Catch-up Stroke 
Becker and Havriluk (2012) avers that when swimming catch-up stroke, where the arm 
is intentionally maintained in a position parallel to the surface at the end of arm entry, 
torso rotation increases the time of exposure in a hyperflexed shoulder position (where 
the hand is higher than the shoulder at the completion of the hand entry) and increases 
shoulder stress.

 3 CHAPTER THREE: Method of Research 
 Introduction 
This chapter describes the protocol that was designed to investigate the objectives 
stated in Chapter 1.  A description of the instruments and technique/s used for all the 
measurements will be discussed.  
The preparation for this dissertation was performed by reviewing literature from the 
following electronic databases: Google Scholar, Ebscohost Web, Academic Search 
Complete, CINAHL with Full Text, Health Source – Consumer Edition, Health Source: 
Nursing/Academic Edition, MEDLINE with Full Text, MasterFILE Premier, 
SPORTDiscuss with Full Text, ScienceDirect.  
The following key words were used in the search: swimming/swimmer, shoulder, 
injury/ies, biomechanics, freestyle, sports injury/ies, athletic injury/ies, and prevention, 
preventive.  Various combinations of the key words were used.  In addition, the 
reference lists of retrieved articles and relevant reviews were hand searched. 
 Study Design 
A cohort-analytical study design was used.  Demographic data was obtained using a 
data sheet.  After completing a questionnaire, all participants were subjected to 
laboratory testing, followed by Aquanex+Video testing. 
 Study Participants 
The study was conducted on swimmers from the Kovsie Aquatics Swim Club, 
Bloemfontein, South Africa during the 2014/2015 swimming season (1 May 2014 to 1 
May 2015).  For this purpose, a convenience sample of sixteen (n=16) swimmers were 
recruited.  All participants were informed about the nature, potential risks and benefits 
of the study, after which they signed a written informed consent document.  Although 
it is a University swim club, the swimmers are aged from as young as 7 and older.  
Confidentiality and anonymity of all participants were ensured, and ethical clearance 
was obtained from the University of the Free State where the study was conducted, 
with the ethical clearance number UFS-HSD2015/0526 (Appendix C). 
 
34 
 
 Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria 
The target population for this study was the Kovsie Aquatics Swim Club from the 
University of the Free State. 
The following inclusion criteria was used: (1) aged between 10 and 25 years; (2) 
having trained with a coach for a minimum of 2.5 years; (3) swimming at least 6 hours 
per week; and (4) qualifying for level 2 and higher. The exclusion criteria were as 
follow: (1) previous surgery on the involved shoulder; (2) previous fracture of the 
shoulder; and (3) inability or unwillingness to participate in the testing with 
Aquanex+Video, participating in the measurement taking (weight, height, shoulder 
internal and external rotation) or completing the questionnaire. 
 Information Document and Informed Consent/Assent 
All the participants read and signed an information document (Appendix D) and an 
informed consent (Appendix E) form.  If participants were younger than 18 years of 
age, their parents/guardians signed the informed consent form and the participant 
signed an informed assent form (Appendix F).  Any information that was acquired 
during this study, and that can be identified with the participant, remains confidential 
and will be disclosed only with permission of the participant or as required by law.  
Confidentiality is maintained by means of allocating numbers to swimmers.  
Information is being kept with the investigator only, and raw data held under lock and 
key.  All processing of data is governed by a PC password protector.  Only the findings 
were published with the strictest of confidentiality to the individual swimmers.  
Participation in the study was voluntary.  Participants were permitted to withdraw from 
the study at any time, and without consequences of any kind.  The swimmer was not, 
in any way, affected if he/she chose not to participate in the study. 
 Demographic Data 
The following demographic data was documented on the day of the Aquanex+Video 
testing (see Appendix G): 
 Date of Birth (Age) 
 Gender 
 Highest swimming qualification 
o Level 2; 
35 
 o Level 3; 
o Senior/Youth Nationals; 
o International Team 
Level galas are grading galas for local competition in South Africa.  Swimmers must 
be registered with Swimming South Africa and need to swim qualifying times at 
qualifying club events.  Qualifying times are set by Swimming South Africa.  The level 
ratings are as follows (http://www.nmb-aquatics.co.za/documents/men-galas-
explained): 
 Level 1:  Regional Gala 
o This is the entry level into National galas and gives the swimmer 
opportunity to compete against other swimmers from around the country.  
This is swum as a club gala. 
 Level 2:  Regional Gala 
o Level 2 qualifying times are slightly more difficult to achieve.  This is 
swum as a club event. 
 Level 3:  National Gala 
o This is the highest level before Senior Nationals. This is also swum as a 
club event 
 Senior/Youth Nationals 
o Once a swimmer has met the qualifying times, a provincial team is 
selected for Senior/Youth Nationals.  This is the highest level of local 
competition in South Africa. 
 Questionnaire 
Al the participants completed a brief survey questionnaire titled ‘Sport and Symptom 
Survey Questionnaire’ (Appendix H).  The survey questionnaire is a slightly altered 
version of the questionnaire used by Harrington et al. (2014).  It was self-administered 
under classroom-style supervision obtaining information regarding the 2014/2015 
swimming season (1st of May 2014 to the 1st of May 2015).  The questionnaire 
requested the following information:  
36 
 
 General Swimming Information 
The participants were instructed to indicate the sum of years participating 
competitively, their stroke preference and their favourite distance.  When swimming 
freestyle, they were asked to specify whether they breathe unilaterally or bilaterally. 
 Swim Training Variables 
3.7.2.1 Frequency 
Swimmers were instructed to document the amount of swimming sessions completed 
on average per week. 
3.7.2.2 Time  
The questionnaire included reporting the average amount of swimming minutes per 
session. 
3.7.2.3 Distance 
Participants were asked to report the kilometres covered on average per session. 
 Injury Definition 
Injuries occur when the energy is transferred to the body in amounts or at rates that 
exceed the threshold for human tissue damage (Meeuwisse et al., 2007).  In the 
consensus statements for Soccer (Fuller et al., 2006) an injury is defined as: 
“Any physical complaint sustained by a player that result from a football match or 
football training, irrespective of the need for medical attention or time-loss from football 
activities.  An injury that results in a player receiving medical attention is referred to as 
a ‘‘medical-attention’’ injury, and an injury that results in a player being unable to take 
a full part in future football training or match play as a ‘‘time-loss’’ injury.” 
In this study, a shoulder injury was classified as: 
“Any physical complaint, concerning the shoulder, sustained by a swimmer that 
resulted from swimming or swimming related training (including dry land training), 
irrespective of the need for medical attention or time-loss from swimming activities.  
An injury that resulted in a swimmer receiving medical attention is referred to as a 
‘‘medical-attention’’ injury, and an injury that resulted in a swimmer being unable to 
take a full part in future swim training or galas as a ‘‘time-loss’’ injury. 
37 
 
 Injury Classification 
3.7.4.1 Mechanism and Side of Injury 
Injuries were classified by the body side and the mechanism of injury (traumatic or 
overuse).  In this context, a traumatic injury refers to an injury resulting from a specific, 
identifiable event and an overuse injury to one caused by repeated micro trauma 
without a single identifiable event responsible for the injury (Fuller et al., 2006). 
3.7.4.2 Shoulder Pain/Symptoms and Functional Ability 
Shoulder pain and symptoms were assessed using respective subscales of the Penn 
Shoulder Score (Tate et al., 2012).  Pain was rated at rest, with normal activities 
(eating, dressing, bathing), and with strenuous activities (sports, reaching, lifting) on a 
scale of 0 ( no pain) to 10 (worst pain possible ).  The pain subscale total was calculated 
by subtracting each of the 3 scores from 10 and then adding them for a total of 0 to 
30, with 30 indicating no pain. 
3.7.4.3 Injury Severity 
The severity of the symptoms were categorised according to ability of the swimmer to 
participate in swim training and competition found in the questionnaire of the study 
done by Harrington et al. (2014). 
1. No pain or shoulder symptoms 
2. Pain/ache only after heavy workouts 
3. Pain/ache (not disabling) during and after workouts 
4. Disabling pain during and after workouts that interfered with your athletic 
performance 
5. Shoulder pain preventing competitive sport participation 
3.7.4.4 Other Injury Classification Issues 
Injuries were classified as to whether these occurred during a gala, training or dry land 
training. 
3.7.4.5 Painful Phases of the Freestyle Stroke 
In a survey of 233 competitive swimmers on 17 collegiate teams, Pink and Tibone 
(2000) found that the part of freestyle stroke most frequently linked to shoulder injury, 
was the first half of the pull through phase (approximately 70% of symptoms were 
noted at this time).  Another vulnerable point of the stroke appeared to be during the 
38 
 first half of recovery (18% of symptoms were elicited at this point according to the latter 
authors).   
Figure 3-1.  Painful phases of the freestyle stroke 
Swimmers were asked to indicate during which part of the stroke the symptoms were 
experienced as seen in Figure 3-1 above (Pink & Tibone, 2000). 
 Measurements  
 Laboratory Testing 
3.8.1.1 Height and Weight 
The following measurements were documented on the day of the Aquanex+Video 
testing (Appendix G): 
 Height (in centimetres) – using a standard stadiometer 
 Weight (in kilograms) – using a calibrated scale 
3.8.1.2 Shoulder Range of Movement 
Active internal and external shoulder range of movement was measured at 90º of 
gleno-humeral abduction (Appendix I).  This was done with a standard plastic long-
armed (12 inch) goniometer with 1º increments, in the supine position (Boon & Smith 
2000).  Each subject was tested by two Biokineticists. 
The investigator described the technique in detail, and demonstrated the procedure, 
including instruction in positioning seen in Figure 3-2 below (Boon & Smith, 2000).  
One Biokineticist positioned the arm in internal rotation, and the second Biokineticist 
measured and recorded the angle.  The scapula was stabilized by applying 
anteropostero-directed force against the coracoid process and clavicle (Boon & Smith, 
2000).  The first Biokineticist then moved the arm through full range of motion to 
external rotation and the measurement was taken and recorded (Boon & Smith, 2000).  
The procedure was repeated for the opposite shoulder.

3.8.2.1 Testing Protocol 
Participants were instructed to warm-up with a 100m freestyle swim.  The standard 
Aquanex+Video testing protocol as described by Becker and Havriluk (2010) was used 
and is described below. 
Sensors were positioned at the centre of the swimmer’s hands between the third and 
fourth metacarpals to measure the pressure differential between the palmar and dorsal 
surfaces.  The sensor and video output were connected to a computer via an interface 
on the pool deck and synchronized the data from the sensors and video.  The 
underwater camera was positioned at 30cm from the water surface at the end of the 
pool. 
Swimmers were instructed to sprint 20m toward the wall where the camera is mounted.  
Underwater video and hand force data was collected over the last 10 m of each trial.  
Two trails of each test were performed with 1-minute rest between each trail.  Figure 
3-3 below illustrates the camera view.

3.8.2.2 Validation 
The testing equipment was validated as explained by Havriluk (1988). 
3.8.2.3 Freestyle Biomechanical Analysis 
The video analysis was done on the video captured during the Aquanex+Video testing.  
A stroke cycle was considered appropriate for analysis if the cycle was completely 
within the camera view, with the body centred in the field of view.  After an in-depth 
study on available literature regarding possible freestyle biomechanical errors 
associated with shoulder pain and advantageous biomechanical positions, a freestyle 
analysis template was assembled (Appendix J).  The first full stroke cycle to enter the 
camera view that met the criteria was selected for analysis using the latter data sheet. 
Data captured by the Aquanex+Video hand sensors (i.e. average peak force, stroke 
velocity, stroke rate, stroke length, and active drag coefficient) were processed and 
analysed.

 Methodological and Measurement Errors 
According to Mouton (2001) the term “research methodology” is the term used to 
describe the process followed to conduct a scientific study.  Thomas et al. (2011) 
describe research as a systematic process of collecting data and logically analysing 
this data to solve problems and to make significant contributions in the field of science, 
for example in swimming.  Research also involves the application of various 
techniques, methods, and approaches for investigating a problem or answering a 
research question. 
Errors in any research study is avoided as far as possible.  The researcher was 
available to assist participants in case of any queries or uncertainties.  Measurement 
errors were minimised by making use of a qualified Biokineticist to assist in taking 
measurements.  In order to minimise equipment errors, all the equipment (scale and 
Aquanex+Video) was calibrated before testing each participant.  Errors in the transfer 
of data into an electronic format was avoided by thorough data checking. 
 Pilot Study 
Mouton (2014) stated that a pilot study is the extensive collection of data to gain a 
comprehensive understanding of a single phenomenon on a particular group (ex. 
swimmers), social setting or event.   A pilot study with three swimmers was conducted 
6 weeks prior to the present study. It consisted of documenting demographic data, 
measuring weight, height and shoulder internal and external range of movement.  This 
was followed by filling out the questionnaire under classroom style supervision.  
Aquanex+Video testing was done in the University of the Free State swimming pool.  
Additionally, the duration of testing an individual swimmer was evaluated in order to 
properly plan testing schedules.  Data sheets, equipment, and protocols were found 
to be effective in testing the proposed objectives. 
 Ethical Aspects 
Marczyk et al. (2005) stated that all studies with human participants involve some 
degree of risk.  The author further mentioned that the researcher must be aware that 
these risks present him with an ethical dilemma.  Therefore, conducting research 
requires integrity, responsibility and honesty in order to protect the rights of the 
42 
 participants.  To render the study ethical, the rights to confidentiality, self-
determination, anonymity, and informed consent will be observed. 
Written permission to conduct this research was obtained from the head coach of 
Kovsie Aquatics, Marco Markgraaff (Appendix A), the director of Kovsie Sport, Mnr. 
D.B. Prinsloo (Appendix B) and the Ethics committee of Humanities, University of the 
Free State (Appendix C). 
Basic elements of informed consent include the following: 
 A fair explanation of the procedures to be followed; 
 A description of the value and benefits of their participation; 
 An offer to answer any enquiries concerning the processes; 
 An indication that the participant is free to withdraw consent and to discontinue 
participation on the project or activity at any time. 
 The rights of the participant will be considered by the researcher; 
 The right to privacy or non-participation; 
 The right to remain anonymous; 
 The right to confidentiality; and 
 The right to expect experimenter responsibility. 
 Analysis of the Data 
Data was captured electronically in Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Office 2010).  The 
statistical analysis described below was done by a biostatistician (Prof R. Schall of the 
Department of Statistical Consultation Unit, Department of Mathematical Statistics and 
Actuarial Science, University of the Free State) using SAS software (SAS; version 9.3 
for Windows; Cary, NC).  
 Descriptive Statistics 
Descriptive statistics, namely frequencies and percentages for categorical data and 
means and standard deviations or medians and percentiles for quantitative data were 
calculated.  
 Binary Risk Factors for Injury 
The association between binary risk factors for injury, and the binary variable “shoulder 
injury” (SI 3), was assessed using Fisher’s exact test.  A P-value for the null-hypothesis 
43 
 of no association between the risk factor in question and the outcome (shoulder injury) 
is reported.  
Furthermore, both the risk of shoulder injury in presence of the risk factor, and the risk 
of injury in the absence of the risk factor was presented; finally, the risk ratio “Risk 
factor present / Risk factor absent” of injury, as well as the exact 95% confidence 
interval for the risk ratio, are reported. 
 Quantitative Risk Factors for Injury 
The association between the quantitative risk factors and the binary variable “shoulder 
injury” (SI 3) was assessed using one-way ANOVA.  Here the quantitative variable 
was the dependent variable, and the binary variable “shoulder injury” was the group 
variable.  
P-values associated with the null-hypothesis of zero mean difference between injured 
and uninjured subjects are reported. Furthermore, the mean difference “Risk factor 
present - Risk factor absent” of the quantitative variable, as well as a 95% confidence 
interval for the mean difference, are reported.

 4 CHAPTER FOUR: Results 
This chapter presents the results obtained from the demographic questionnaire, 
laboratory testing and freestyle biomechanics analysis.  The results are displayed to 
reflect the demographic information of this cohort of swimmers, followed by the data 
on the prevalence of shoulder injuries and the data from the freestyle biomechanical 
analysis. 
The results are narrated in this chapter to highlight their significance within the 
represented profiles.  Interpretation and discussion of the findings follow in Chapter 5. 
 Participants 
The demographic information displayed in this section provides an overview of the 
cohort of swimmers from Kovsie Aquatics Swimming Club in the 2014/2015 season. 
 Demographic Data 
Descriptive statistics, namely frequencies and percentages for categorical data and 
means and standard deviations or medians and percentiles for quantitative data were 
calculated. 
Sixteen (n=16) competitive swimmers (6 male, 10 female), adhering to the inclusion 
criteria, participated in the study.  The age of the total sample ranged between 11 and 
19 years with a mean age of 15.1 (± 2.78) years.  Most of the swimmers fell in the 13 
to 14 years age group, totalling to 6 (37.5%) swimmers.  This was followed by 4 (25%) 
in the 17 to 18 years category.  The distribution of the rest of the population is depicted 
in Figure 4-1.

 The mean height was 166.6cm (±11.09), while the mean body mass was 59.4 kg (± 
12.03).  Nine (56.3%) of the swimmers qualified for Level 2.  The swimmers’ level of 
qualification can be observed in Figure 4-2 below.

 Swim Training Variables 
A summary of various questions regarding the swimmers training variables is given in 
Table 4-1.  Eight (50%) of the participants indicated swimming 3 to 4 sessions per 
week while the other 8 (50%) trained more than 5 sessions per week.  Eight (50%) 
swimmers trained for 90 minutes or more per training session while only 1 (6.25%) 
indicated swimming 45 to 60 minutes per session.  Five (31.3%) participants swim on 
average 3 to 4 kilometres per session, while the remaining 11 (68.8%) cover more 
than 4 kilometres per session. 
Table 4-1.  Training variables 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The sample was stratified into 2 groups.  One group reported swimming 5 sessions 
(or more) per week and 5km (or more) per session.  This group consisted of five 
swimmers.  The other group reported swimming less than 5 session per week or less 
than 5km per session.  This group consisted of 11 swimmers.  Interestingly it seems 
that participants with the higher training load were less prone to injury with only one 
(20%) of the group with the higher training load reporting a shoulder injury.  Nine (82%) 
of the 11 swimmers with a reduced training load reported a shoulder injury (refer to 
Figure 4-5).  This however raises the question of whether participants reduced their 
training load after injury.  Unfortunately, due to the retrospective nature of this study,   Frequency(n)  Percentage

 it is not possible to conclude whether training distance was reduced as a result of injury 
or if a correlation between a lower training load and shoulder injury exist.

 Eight (80%) of the injured swimmers were female and only 2 (20%) were male.  
Female swimmers were more prone to injury than their male counterparts.  Eight 
(80%) of the 10 female swimmers presented with a shoulder injury, while only 2 (33%) 
of the six male participants reporting a shoulder injury.  
Three (75%) in the category 17 to 18 years presented with a shoulder injury, while 4 
(67%) of the 13 to 14 years category and 2 (67%) of the 11 to 12 years category 
reported a shoulder injury.  One (50%) of the 2 swimmers between 15 and 16 years 
sustained a shoulder injury.

 4.2.3.2 Mechanism and Side of Injury 
All the injured swimmers indicated that the cause of the shoulder injury was due to 
overuse during swim training and not due to trauma. 
Figure 4-8 shows that 7 (70%) of the injured swimmers experienced bilateral shoulder 
pain, with 2 (20%) swimmers experiencing symptoms only in the right shoulder and 1 
(10%) only in the left shoulder.

4.2.3.3 Injury Severity 
Disabling pain during and after workouts that interfered with the swimmers’ 
performance described 6 (60%) of the participants symptoms.  Three (30%) 
participants experienced pain/ache (not disabling) during and after workouts.  Only 1 
(10%) swimmer reported pain/ache after heavy workouts. 
4.2.3.4 Painful Phases during the Freestyle Stroke 
Six (60%) of the injured participants experienced their symptoms only during the early 
pull through phase with 1 (10%) experiencing symptoms only during the recovery 
phase.  However, 3 (30%) swimmers experienced symptoms during both the early pull 
through and the recovery phase.  Figure 4-11 illustrates the distribution of the painful 
phases of the freestyle stroke in this population.

 Freestyle Stroke Biomechanical Analysis Results 
The association between binary risk factors for injury, and the binary variable “shoulder 
injury” (SI 3), was assessed using Fisher’s exact test.  A P-value for the null-hypothesis 
of no association between the risk factor in question and the outcome (shoulder injury) 
is reported. 
Furthermore, both the risk of shoulder injury in presence of the risk factor, and the risk 
of injury in the absence of the risk factor was presented; finally, the risk ratio “Risk 
factor present / Risk factor absent” of injury, as well as the exact 95% confidence 
interval for the risk ratio, are reported. 
52 
 None of the risk factors that were investigated in this study was statistically significant.  
It should however be noted that the low power to detect statistically significant risk 
factors was due to the relatively small sample.  Nevertheless, the study results 
presented below suggest variables which might be associated with an increased risk 
for shoulder injury, and thus suggest a number of risk factors worthy of further study 
in future research.

 4.2.4.1 Hand Entry Phase– Right Hand/Arm 
The results in Table 4-2 indicate that 71.4% (5 out of 7) of the swimmers with a right 
hand crossing the midline upon hand entry presented with an injury to the right 
shoulder, compared to 44.4% (4 out of 9 swimmers) without this risk factor [Risk ratio 
(RR) =1.61; 95%CI for RR 0.67 to 3.83].  Thus, swimmers with a right hand crossing 
the midline upon hand entry were 1.6 times more likely to present with a right shoulder 
injury than swimmers without. 
Swimmers with a hand/arm position at the end of the entry phase where the right 
shoulder was in hyperflexed with the fingertips facing upward were twice as likely to 
present with a right shoulder injury [Risk ratio (RR) =2.00; 95%CI for RR 0.21 to 4.34]. 
4.2.4.2 Late Pull Through Phase (Push Phase) – Right Hand/Arm 
A risk ratio larger than 1.5 was observed for those swimmers with a drop in force 
production during the late pull through phase [Risk ratio (RR) =1.59; 95%CI for RR 
0.56 to 14.84]. 
4.2.4.3 Swimming Catch-Up Stroke – Right Hand/Arm 
Seventy five percent (3 out of 4) of the swimmers swimming ‘catch-up stroke’ with the 
right hand/arm presented with a right shoulder injury, compared to 50% (6 out of 12) 
of the swimmers without this risk factor on the same side [Risk ratio (RR) =1.50; 95%CI 
for RR 0.67 to 3.34].  Swimmers presenting with this risk factor on the right hand/arm 
were 1.5 times more likely to present with a right shoulder injury.

  4.2.4.4 Hand Entry Phase – Left Hand/Arm 
Swimmers with a left thumb first hand entry were 1.67 times more likely to present with 
a left shoulder injury than those without [Risk ratio (RR) =1.67; 95%CI for RR 0.58 to 
3.09]. 
Swimmers presenting with a left hand entering between the shoulder and the midline 
of the body were also 1.67 times more likely to present with a left shoulder injury [Risk 
ratio (RR) =1.67; 95%CI for RR 0.57 to 9.43]. 
A hyperflexed left shoulder with the fingertips facing upward also seemed to increase 
the risk of left shoulder injury.  Seventy five percent (3 out of 4) of the swimmers with 
a left hyperflexe shoulder upon hand entry presented with a left shoulder injury, 
compared with 41.67% (5 out of 12) of swimmers without this biomechanical 
characteristic [Risk ratio (RR) =1.88; 95%CI for RR 0.58 to 3.09].  The presence of 
this risk factor increases the risk of injury to the left shoulder by 1.88 times. 
4.2.4.5 Early Pull Through Phase – Left Hand/Arm 
Interestingly, 100% (4 out of 4) of the swimmers with a left hand position outside the 
elbow during the early pull through phase had reported an injury to the left shoulder.  
In contrast, only 33.33% (4 out of 12 swimmers) without this biomechanical 
characteristic presented with a shoulder injury [Risk ratio (RR) =3.00; 95%CI for RR 
1.13 to 10.08].  Swimmers with this risk factor on the left arm were 3 times more likely 
to sustain a left shoulder injury. 
4.2.4.6 Swimming Catch-up Stroke – Left Hand/Arm 
In line with the findings for the right shoulder, swimming ‘catch-up stroke’ with the left 
arm also seems to increase the risk for left shoulder injury by 1.8 times.  Seventy five 
percent (3 out of 4) of the swimmers with this risk factor presented with a left shoulder 
injury compared to 43.67% (5 out 12 swimmers) without this risk factor [Risk ratio (RR) 
=1.80; 95%CI for RR 0.33 to 5.00]. 
 Aquanex+Video Quantitative Data Results 
The association between the quantitative risk factors and the binary variable “shoulder 
injury” (SI 3) was assessed using one-way ANOVA.  Here the quantitative variable 
was the dependent variable, and the binary variable “shoulder injury” was the group 
variable.  
59 
  P-values associated with the null-hypothesis of zero mean difference between injured 
and uninjured subjects are reported. Furthermore, the mean difference “Risk factor 
present - Risk factor absent” of the quantitative variable, as well as a 95% confidence 
interval for the mean difference, are reported.

When isolating left shoulder injuries and comparing all the variables as set out in Table 
4-5 it seems that the swimmers with a left shoulder injury had deficits in most of the 
parameters determining swimming speed.  The only variable the injured group did 
better in was stroke length.

  5 CHAPTER FIVE: Discussion of Results 
Four strokes are recognized in competitive swimming: freestyle, butterfly, backstroke, 
and breaststroke (Wanivenhaus et al., 2012).  Regardless of the stroke performed in 
competition, swimmers spend a considerable time swimming freestyle (Wanivenhaus 
et al., 2012).  According to Sein et al., (2010) more than 90% of the swimmers in their 
study spent more than 50% of their training time on freestyle.  Most of the swimming 
propulsive force is derived from the arms, with the legs adding stabilization as well as 
propulsive force (McMaster, 1996).  King (1995) stated that 80% of the propulsion 
power is derived from the pull and 20% from the kick during freestyle.  In a competitive 
training program a swimmer can easily log up to a million arm strokes per year 
(McMaster, 1999) and can exceed 4000 strokes for one shoulder in a single workout, 
making swimming a common source of shoulder pathology (Tovin, 2006).  The 
monotonous nature and the high volume of training involved in competitive swimming 
result in cumulative overload injuries (Rodeo, 1999).  Shoulder pain is not only the 
most common complaint for swimmers, it has a high potential to have an impact on a 
swimmer’s ability to compete (McMaster, 1999). 
Epidemiologic studies have consistently noted a high incidence and prevalence of 
shoulder pain and dysfunction in competitive swimmers (Beach et al., 1992; McMaster 
et al., 1998; Puckree & Thomas, 2006; Bansal et al., 2007; Wolf et al., 2009; Sein et 
al., 2010; Tate et al., 2012). 
Prevention of injuries is an important aspect of athletic training.  Our current 
understanding of injury causation is limited and must be improved to develop effective 
interventions for modifying injury risk.  Identifying risk factors for shoulder injuries 
associated with certain freestyle pathomechanics therefore might improve incidence 
and/or prevalence of shoulder injuries under competitive swimmers. 
 Participants 
Competitive swimmers begin their swimming careers as early as age seven, and most 
of them train and compete year round (Sein et al., 2010).  Swimmers start their 
intensive training early, typically at the age of 8 to 11 years, and the amount of training 
can be excessive (Bak, 2010).  Tate et al. (2012) found high school swimmers to be 
63 
  most symptomatic in their study of 236 female swimmers between 8 and 77 years of 
age. 
Sixteen (n=16) competitive swimmers (6 male, 10 female) participated in this study.  
The age of the total sample ranged between 10 and 19 years with a mean age of 15.05 
(± 2.78) years.  This was similar to the population studied by Sein et al., (2010) who 
reported a mean age of 15.9 (± 2.78) years.  Ten (62.5%) of the swimmers were 
female, and 6 (37.5%) were male.  In the study done by Sein et al., (2010), 42 (53%) 
were male and 38 (47%) were female.  The mean height was 166.63cm (±11.09), 
while the mean body mass was 59.44 kg (± 12.03).  Nine (56.25%) of the swimmers 
qualified for Level 2, while two (12.5%) qualified for Level 3, one (6.25%) for Junior 
Nationals, three (18.75%) for Senior Nationals and one (6.25%) receiving National 
Colours. 
 General Swimming Information 
 Years Participating 
The minimum participant requirements for participating in this study was swimming 
competitively for at least two and a half years.  Most of the swimmers (n=15) in this 
study have been swimming competitively for 5 or more years with only 1 swimmer 
competing for 3 to 4 years.  All the swimmers included in the study by Sein et al., 
(2010) had been coached for at least two and a half years.   
 Stroke Preference 
According to Wanivenhaus et al. (2012), regardless of the stroke performed in 
competition, swimmers spend a considerable time swimming freestyle.  Kammer et al. 
(1999) avers that most (75% to 90%) of training is done in freestyle, irrespective of the 
swimmers’ speciality.  Not only was freestyle the most common stroke in a study by 
Wolf et al. (2009), it was also associated with the highest total number of injuries in 
their five-year survey of 94 National College Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I 
swimmers from the University of Iowa.  Sein et al., (2010) reported that more than 90% 
of the swimmers in their study spent more than 50% of their training time on freestyle.  
They further noted that the swimmers approximately spent 13% of their training time 
on butterfly, 21% on back stroke and 13% on breaststroke.  Considering the 
swimmers’ main event in the latter study, 35% specialised in freestyle, 19% in butterfly, 
64 
  24% in backstroke and 5% were individual medley swimmers.  Puckree and Thomas 
(2006) found that 69% of the swimmers in their study competed in freestyle. 
In accordance with the above findings, freestyle was the most popular stroke in this 
study with 9 (56.25%) swimmers preferring it.  Breaststroke, backstroke and individual 
medley were respectively preferred by 2 (12.5%) swimmers and only 1 (6.25%) 
swimmer preferred butterfly.  Recent research suggests that most swim training is 
done in freestyle.  Therefore, analysis of freestyle biomechanics might play a role not 
only in performance, but also in injury prevention. 
 Distance Preference 
Middle distance was the favourite distance among the participants with 10 (62.5%) of 
the swimmers claimed to favour these distances (200m-400m).  Four (25%) preferred 
sprints (50m-100m) and 2 (12.5%) open water events.  None of the participants 
showed an interest in the 800m-1500m category.  These findings were different than 
the findings by Puckree and Thomas (2006) who found most swimmers (70%) in their 
study specialising in sprints.  Wolf et al. (2009) found that the risk of suffering an injury 
was not significantly different between sprinters and distance swimmers.  This seems 
true as the percentage injured swimmers in this study was in line with that found by 
Puckree and Thomas (2006), despite the difference in distance preference. 
 Breathing Side 
Nine (56.25%) of the participants claimed to breath bilaterally while 7 (43.75%) 
breathed to the right only.  None of the swimmers breathed to the left when swimming 
freestyle. 
 Swim Training Variables 
Tovin (2006) remarked that training errors such as overuse, misuse, abuse or disuse 
may contribute to shoulder pain in swimmers.  In their study on the cause of shoulder 
injuries in swimmers, Sein et al. (2010) found that the incidence of supraspinatus 
tendinopathy was related to time spent training (hours swim per week) and distance 
swim per week.  From the latter research, swimmers who swam more than 15 hours 
per week were twice as likely to have tendinopathy as those who trained for less time.  
Swimmers who swam more than 35km per week were four times more likely than 
those who swam fewer kilometres (Sein et al., 2010).  Besides these findings they 
65 
  further noted that a greater proportion of swimmers competing at a higher level of 
competition had an increased incidence of supraspinatus tendinopathy than swimmers 
at lower competitive levels.  These findings are supported by the findings of Tate et al. 
(2012) who found that high school swimmers practised on average 16 hours per week 
and had the highest prevalence (22.6%) of symptomatic shoulders.  Tate et al. (2012) 
further proposed that shoulder pain, dissatisfaction, and disability correlates positively 
with increased repetitive upper extremity usage in terms of swimming or water polo 
exposure for mature swimmers. 
 Frequency 
The swimmers in the study done by Puckree and Thomas (2006) trained on average 
11 sessions per week, which is much higher than the population in this study.  In this 
study 8 (50%) of the participants indicated swimming 3 to 4 sessions per week while 
the other 8 (50%) trained for more than 5 sessions per week.   
 Time 
Tate et al. (2012) found that high school swimmers practised on average 16 hours per 
week had the highest prevalence (22.6%) of symptomatic shoulders.  The average 
length of the swimmer’s training sessions in Puckree and Thomas’ (2006) study was 
90 minutes.  In this study 8 (50%) trained for 90 minutes or more per session, 6 
(37.5%) trained 60 to 75 minutes per session while 1 (6.25%) indicated training 45 to 
60 minutes per session and 1 (6.25%) indicated training 75 to 90 minutes per session.  
Sein et al., (2010) reported that the amount of time the swimmers practised in the 
water varied between 9 and 110 km/week.  Time spent in the water training seems to 
relate to the risk of shoulder injury and should accurately be captured in future studies 
to determine its relevance to shoulder injury. 
 Distance 
The swimmers in the study by Sein et al., (2010) swam between 9 and 110 km/week 
with a median distance of 40km/week.  In this study 5 (31.25%) swimmers on average 
covered 3 to 4 kilometres per session, while 11 (68.75%) covered more than 4 
kilometres per session. 
  
66 
  
 Shoulder Injury 
Shoulder pain is not only the most common complaint for swimmers it has a high 
potential to have an impact on a swimmer’s ability to compete (McMaster, 1999).  It 
has been suggested that swimmers with interfering shoulder pain might not progress 
in training and will therefore not compete as effectively (McMaster & Troup, 1993), and 
injuries to the shoulder can be devastating (McMaster, 1999). 
 Prevalence of Shoulder Injury 
Recent studies reported the prevalence of shoulder injuries ranging from 17% to 91% 
(McMaster & Troup, 1993; McMaster et al., 1998; Puckree & Thomas, 2006; Bansal 
et al., 2007; Wolf et al., 2009; Sein et al., 2010; Tate et al., 2012) and an incidence 
between 10% and 69% (Beach et al., 1992; McMaster & Troup, 1993).  An alarmingly 
high prevalence of shoulder injury was found by Sein et al. (2010) who reported a 91% 
of swimmers experienced shoulder pain.  This correlated with the work done by Beach 
et al. (1992) who claimed a prevalence of 87% and an incidence of 69%. 
In this study 10 (62.5%) of the participants reported having a shoulder injury during 
the 2014/2015 season.  Similar to these results, Puckree and Thomas (2006) reported 
that 70% of their respondents experienced shoulder pain, while 64% presented with 
actual shoulder injuries.  Conflicting with this, Bansal et al. (2007) found a prevalence 
of 17% of shoulder injuries in their study on 161 male swimmers, which was in line 
with the findings of Tate et al. (2012) who reported a shoulder injury prevalence of 
about 20%. 
The inconsistent findings may be due to the different study designs used (retrospective 
vs. prospective), and the definition of the severity of the injury.  For instance, Wolf et 
al. (2009) defined an injury as: “...any musculoskeletal problem suffered as a 
consequence of team related activity that resulted in a visit to an athletic trainer or 
physician”, whereas McMaster and Troup (1993) defined a shoulder injury as: “that 
which interfered with training or progress in training as opposed to post exercise 
muscle soreness”.  Notwithstanding, the high incidence and/or prevalence of shoulder 
injuries in swimmers, the literature is beset with controversy surrounding its aetiology. 
67 
  
 Prevalence of Shoulder Injury and Gender 
Eight (80%) of the injured swimmers in this study were female, while only 2 (20%) 
were male.  Coincidentally eight (80%) of the 10 female swimmers presented with a 
shoulder injury and only 2 (30%) of the 6 male swimmers were injured.  In line with the 
above findings, a study done during the 13th FINA World Championships 2009 found 
female athletes to be at a higher risk of injury than their male counter parts (Mountjoy 
et al., 2010). Contrary to this finding, neither Ristolainen et al. (2009) nor Wolf et al. 
(2009) found a correlation between risk of injury and gender. 
Becker (2011) reported that swimmer’s shoulder syndromes, under female swimmers, 
are likely to occur approximately three times over a career span: 
 The first occurrence is usually during early to mid-adolescence when the body 
weight is likely to increase and arm strength is not fully developed while the 
swimmer is moving to a higher age group. 
 The second period is in the later stages of high school competition.  Although 
the body weight is almost settled, the upper body is not sufficiently strong 
enough to withstand the harder training. 
 The third period is during the transition from high school to college swimming.  
Collegiate swimming often entails dramatic increases in training volume and 
intensity.  In keeping with the latter Wolf et al. (2009) reported that the highest 
total number of injuries and the highest mean number of injuries per swimmer 
occurred during the freshman year of eligibility.  They concluded that this might 
be due to an increase in swimming yardage and additional cross training 
activities than at high school level. 
Becker (2011) further suggested that in males, two peak times for onset of injury occur: 
 First, at the end of the second growth spurt, when the body size increases but 
shoulder muscles are not yet developed. 
 The second time when injury occurs is the high training point of the freshman 
year, when the yardage exceeds previous distances and these increases occur 
over a period of a few days. 
 
68 
  The results of this study suggest that female swimmers are more at risk of 
experiencing a shoulder injury.  When considering the work done by Becker (2011) it 
seems that female swimmers are at risk of shoulder injury for most of their competitive 
swimming careers.  Another contributing factor might be that there is probably no 
differentiation made between the male and female swimmers’ training volume and 
intensity.  Female swimmers practising at the same intensity and volume as their male 
counterparts might be at an increased risk of shoulder injury.  This is should be 
ventured in future research. 
 Prevalence of Shoulder Injury and Age 
Sein et al. (2010) found that 100% (8/8) of the swimmers between 17 to 18 in their 
study presented with supraspinatus tendinopathy.  This was in line with the findings in 
this study where the 17 to 18 years age category also seemed to be the most 
susceptible to shoulder injury.  Three (75%) of the four swimmers in this age category 
presented with a shoulder injury.  This was followed by the 13 to 14 years age category 
with 67% (4 out of 6 swimmers) injured and 67% (2 out of 3) of the 11 to 12 years age 
category reported a shoulder injury.  Differing results from Puckree and Thomas 
(2006) was reported, where swimmers between 15 to 16 years of age seemed to have 
a higher risk of shoulder injuries.  It is inconclusive whether certain age categories are 
more at risk for experiencing shoulder injuries/pain than others. 
 Mechanism of Injury 
All the injured swimmers in this study averred that the cause was overuse during swim 
training not due to trauma.  Opposing these findings, Puckree and Thomas (2006) 
reported 65% of injuries due to overuse, and 25% traumatic injuries.  Wolf et al. (2009) 
reported that nearly 60% of the injuries in their study was training/practice related, 
while 38% was due to team activities out of the pool, including strength training and 
dryland workouts. 
 Side of Injury 
Bilateral shoulder injuries were experienced by 7 (70%) of the injured swimmers in this 
study, while 2 (20%) experienced symptoms right only, and 1 (10%) left only.  The 
prevalence of bilateral shoulder pain was higher than that found by Sein et al. (2010).  
In their cross-sectional study on a group of 80 elite swimmers, 43 (54%) reported 
unilateral shoulder pain, and 30 (37%) others reported bilateral shoulder pain. 
69 
  
 Injury Severity 
Disabling pain during and after workouts that interfered with the swimmers’ 
performance described 6 (60%) of the participants in this study’s symptoms.  Three 
(30%) swimmers experienced pain/ache (not disabling) during and after workouts.  
Only 1 (10%) reported pain/ache after heavy workouts.  Beach et al. (1992) found that 
31% of their participants had a shoulder injury affecting their swimming ability. 
None of the participants in this study stopped swimming as a result of shoulder pain 
or injury, whereas Puckree and Thomas (2006) reported that 75% of the swimmers in 
their study who complained of a shoulder injury, had to stop swimming temporarily for 
2 to 3 weeks.  Interestingly Abgarov et al. (2012) found a negative effect for taking off 
from the sport of swimming.  The expectation was that taking time off would reduce 
injury risk but found an increased risk of injury instead.  They further elaborated, that 
those athletes who took time off placed unrealistic expectations on themselves once 
they returned to the sport.  This attitude of attempting to make up for lost time and/or 
‘catch up’ to familiar swimmers, would increase the risk of injury as time off from the 
sport puts an athlete/swimmer behind with regards to their development or fitness 
levels (Abgarov et al., 2012). 
 Painful Phases during the Freestyle Stroke 
Swim training involves repetitive overhead movement (Sein et al., 2010).  In a 
competitive training program a swimmer can easily log up to a million arm strokes per 
year (McMaster, 1999) and can exceed 4000 strokes for one shoulder in a single 
workout, making swimming a common source of shoulder pathology (Tovin, 2006).  
Swimming requires several different shoulder motions, most being performed during 
circumduction in clockwise and counter-clockwise directions with varying degrees of 
internal and external rotation and scapular protraction and retraction (Tovin, 2006). 
In their study on 11 male College swimmers, Yanai and Hay (1998) found the mean 
duration of impingement positioning during freestyle swimming to be up to 24.8%, with 
14.4% of this occurring during pulling and 10.4% during recovery.  The latter is in line 
with the findings by Pink and Tibone (2000) who explained that the first half of the pull 
through is the most frequently identified painful phase.  According to them, 
approximately 70% of the symptoms noted when swimming freestyle occur during this 
70 
  phase.  They further acknowledged that the first half of the recovery is another 
vulnerable point where 18% of symptoms are experienced. 
In accordance to the above, 6 (60%) of the injured participants in this study only 
experienced their symptoms during the early pull through phase while 1 (10%) 
swimmer only experienced symptoms during the recovery phase.  However, 3 (30%) 
experienced symptoms during both the early pull through and recovery phase.  This 
is probably due to the to the arm being in the vulnerable impingement position 
(shoulder in abduction and internal rotation) during both these phases.  Swimming 
drills advancing increased time spent in these positions should be avoided in an 
attempt to decrease the risk of shoulder injury. 
 Freestyle Pathomechanics and Shoulder Injuries 
McMaster (1996) mentioned that many injuries originate from faulty techniques or 
mechanisms, and an assessment of injured athletes’ biomechanics must be made to 
identify factors that may contribute to injury.  Some specific freestyle technical flaws 
heavily stress the shoulders and can lead to overuse (Kammer et al., 1999).  Yanai 
and Hay (1998) suggested that certain stroke techniques and/or physiques might be 
less vulnerable to shoulder impingement than others.  Stroke mechanics not only 
seems important in injury prevention, but the energy cost of freestyle swimming (ml/m) 
appears to be strongly influenced by the swimmers lean body weight and the effective 
application of force during the arm stroke (Costill et al., 1985).  Tovin (2006) suggested 
that the treatment of competitive swimmers should focus on prevention and early 
treatment, addressing the impairments associated with the condition, and analysing 
training methods and stroke mechanics. 
The freestyle stroke pull-cycle can be divided in four phases (José et al., 2012): 
1. Early pull-through: beginning with the hand entry into the water and ending 
when the humerus is perpendicular to the axis of the torso. 
2. Late pull-through: beginning at the completion of early pull-through and ending 
as the hand leaves the water. 
3. Early recovery: beginning at hand exit and ending when the humerus is 
perpendicular to the water surface. 
4. Late recovery: beginning at the completion of early recovery and ending at hand 
entry. 
71 
  Underwater video analysis was done on the 16 study participants to evaluate if certain 
freestyle biomechanics or pathomechanics was associated with an increased risk of 
shoulder injury.  The presence of the following freestyle pathomechanics increased 
the risk of shoulder injury (observed risk ratio 1.5 or higher). 
5.4.8.1 Hand Entry 
Scovazzo et al. (1991) found that swimmers with painful shoulders had a different 
pattern of hand entry than those with normal shoulders.  According to them the hand 
entered further away from the midline.  None of the swimmers in this study presented 
with this risk factor.  Contrary to this, Johnson et al. (2003) suggested that a hand entry 
that crosses the midline of the long axis of the body, causes mechanical impingement 
in the anterior shoulder, including the long head of the biceps and supraspinatus.  This 
is exacerbated by a thumb first entry which further stresses the biceps attachment to 
the anterior labrum (Johnson et al., 2003).  According to the latter authors, a crossover 
pull through usually results from a crossover entry, and increases the time in the 
impingement position. 
In this study swimmers with a right hand crossing the midline upon hand entry were 
1.6 times more likely to present with a right shoulder injury than swimmers without this 
risk factor.  This finding was inconsistent with the corresponding data for the left 
shoulder.  For swimmers with a left hand crossing the midline upon hand entry the risk 
ratio of injury to the left shoulder was only 0.77.  However, swimmers entering with the 
left hand between the midline of the body and the shoulder were 1.6 times more likely 
to present with a left shoulder injury.  It is not clear whether entering with the hand 
crossing the midline or entering with the hand between the midline of the body and the 
shoulder increases the risk of shoulder injury due to the inconsistent findings between 
right and left shoulders. 
Interestingly, the analysis of the left shoulder revealed that swimmers entering with the 
left thumb first had a 1.6 times higher risk of left shoulder injury than the swimmers 
without this risk factor.  Swimmers with the same risk factor on the right side had a 
moderately increased risk of presenting with a shoulder injury, and were 1.3 times 
more likely to experience symptoms.  Although this is below the observed risk ratio of 
1.5 it increases the risk of injury moderately.

  It seems that entering with the thumb first during hand entry increases the risk for 
shoulder injury.  This is probably due to the fact that this position increases internal 
rotation of the humerus, thus increasing the pressure on the subacromial structures 
and producing symptoms.  We note again, however, that none of these biomechanical 
variables correlated statistically significantly with an injury of the shoulder, 
5.4.8.2 Hand/Arm Position at the end of the Hand Entry Phase 
Yanai and Hay (1998) reported that the hydrodynamic force exerted on the hand 
during entry could forcibly elevate the arm beyond normal maximum active flexion, 
placing the shoulder in a position of hyperflexion, causing impingement.  In 
accordance with this, Becker and Havriluk (2012) found that an intentional effort to 
complete the arm entry with the arm parallel to the surface is a technique factor that 
contributes to an ineffective arm position, increased shoulder stress, minimal force 
production and breaks in propulsion.  This was consistent with the findings of this 
study.  Both swimmers (2 out of 2;100%) with a hand/arm position where the shoulder 
is in hyperflexion with the fingers facing upward on the right arm, presented with a right 
shoulder injury (2/2; 100%), while 75% (3 out of 4) of swimmers with this risk factor in 
the left arm reported a shoulder injury.  Swimmers had a risk ratio of 2.00 and 1.80 on 
the right and left arm respectively, in the presence of this risk factor.  Although this is 
not statistically significant due to the small sample size, this might be a risk factor to 
consider in future studies. 
5.4.8.3 Early Pull Through Phase– Elbow Position 
According to Yanai and Hay (1998) the shoulder is abducted and internally rotated 
during the pull phase.  One of the most commonly described technical faults in 
freestyle swimming is called the “dropped elbow” (Figure 2-11) and occurs during this 
phase (Yanai & Hay 1998).  Dropping the elbow constitutes increasing shoulder 
external rotation, in an attempt to avoid the painful internal rotation causing 
impingement (Richardson et al., 1980).  This position places the muscles of propulsion 
at a mechanical disadvantage (Richardson et al., 1980).  It is still unknown whether 
the stroke alterations seen in swimmers with symptomatic shoulders are the cause or 
the consequence of pain (Heinlein & Cosgarea, 2010). 
In this study, neither swimming with a high elbow, nor a dropped elbow seemed to 
increase risk for a shoulder injury.  None of these biomechanical variables correlated 
73 
  significantly with an injury of the right shoulder, which can be attributed to the relatively 
small sample size. 
5.4.8.4 Early Pull Through Phase– Hand Position 
In this study, it seemed that a left-hand position outside the elbow during the early pull 
through phase increased the risk of injury to the left shoulder.  All (4 out of 4) swimmers 
with this risk factor on the left arm presented with a left shoulder injury, compared to 
33% (4 out of 12) injured swimmers without it.  Swimmers with this risk factor on the 
left hand were 3 times more likely to sustain a shoulder injury.  Comparing this to the 
findings of the right shoulder, in the presence of this risk factor swimmers were 1.24 
times more likely to sustain a right shoulder injury.  Although this is below the observed 
risk ratio of 1.5 it increases the risk of injury moderately. 
It appears that swimming with a hand position outside the elbow during the early pull 
through phase increases the risk of shoulder injury and should therefore be considered 
for future research.  None of these biomechanical variables correlated statistically 
significantly with an injury of the shoulder, which can be attributed to the relatively 
small sample size. 
5.4.8.5 Catch-up Stroke 
Intentional maintenance of the arm in a position parallel to the surface (as in catch up 
stroke), causes torso rotation to increase the time of exposure of the shoulder in a 
hyperflexed position, and exacerbates shoulder stress (Becker & Havriluk, 2012).   
In line with the above notion 75% (3 out of 4) of the swimmers swimming catch up 
stroke with the right hand/arm had a right shoulder injury, compared with 50% (6 out 
of 12) of the swimmers without this risk factor on the same side.  Swimmers presenting 
with this risk factor in the right arm/hand were 1.5 times more likely to sustain a right 
shoulder injury.  In line with the findings for the right shoulder, swimming ‘catch-up 
stroke’ with the left arm also increases the risk for left shoulder injury.  Seventy five 
percent (3 out of 4) of the swimmers with this risk factor left presented with a left 
shoulder injury compared to 43.67% (5 out of 12) without this risk factor.  Swimmers 
presenting with this risk factor in the left arm/hand were 1.8 times more likely to present 
with a shoulder injury on the left shoulder. 
Although this is not statistically significant due to the small sample size, this might be 
a risk factor to consider in future studies. 
74 
  
 Aquanex+Video Quantitative Data Analysis and Shoulder Injuries 
When considering the Aquanex+Video data as outlined in Table 6 (Chapter 4) it 
becomes apparent that the uninjured swimmers outperformed injured swimmers in all 
the variables except stroke length.  The injured swimmers had an average stroke 
velocity (meter per second travelled at the completion of one stroke cycle) of 1.36m/s, 
while the uninjured swimmers had an average stroke velocity of 1.48m/s.  To calculate 
the time to complete an event, the following equation can be used 
Time = Distance (m)÷ Stroke Velocity (m/s) 
This in turn means that the uninjured swimmers can, on average, do a 50m freestyle 
sprint in 33.78s and the injured swimmers in 36.76s.  Swimmers with overuse injuries 
seldom stop swimming, but the injury has a detrimental effect on performance.  
Although these findings are to be expected, this data outlines the importance of injury 
prevention.  
75 
  6 Conclusion and Recommendations 
This study focused on a specific, small population.  The small sample size implied that 
the study had low power to detect statistically significant risk factors.  Nevertheless, 
the study results suggest that some freestyle bio- or pathomechanics might increase 
the risk for shoulder injury and are therefore worthy of further research. 
Objective 1:  Determine the shoulder injury prevalence at the University of the Free 
State’s swimming club (Kovsie Aquatics), during the 2014/2015 swimming season. 
The prevalence of shoulder injuries in this study was 62.5%.  All the injured swimmers 
indicated that their injuries were caused by overuse during swim training.  Interestingly, 
in this study, the female swimmers seem to be at a higher risk for shoulder injuries 
than their male counterparts.  Eighty percent (8 out of 10) of the female swimmers in 
this population presented with a shoulder injury, compared to 30% (2 out of 6) of the 
male swimmers.  The 17 to18 age category seemed to be most susceptible to injury, 
with 75% (3 out of 4) of the swimmers in this age category presenting with a shoulder 
injury.  Bilateral shoulder injuries were experienced by 70% of the injured swimmers 
in this study, while 20% experienced symptoms right only, and 10% left only. 
Objective 2:  Investigate if a correlation between certain freestyle biomechanical hand 
and arm positions and shoulder injuries amongst swimmers from the swimming club 
exist. 
In this study, 6 (60%) of the injured participants only experienced their symptoms 
during the early pull through phase while 1 (10%) swimmer only experienced 
symptoms during the recovery phase.  However, 3 (30%) experienced symptoms 
during both the early pull through and recovery phase.  This is probably due to the to 
the arm being in the vulnerable impingement position (shoulder abduction and internal 
rotation) during both these phases.  Swimming drills advancing increased time spent 
in these positions should be avoided in an attempt to decrease the risk of shoulder 
injury.  Although none of the risk factors investigated in this study was statistically 
significant, the presence of the following freestyle pathomechanics increased the risk 
of shoulder injury (observed risk ratio 1.5 or higher), and should be considered in future 
research of this problem: 
76 
  1. A right hand that crosses the midline upon hand entry (RR 1.61; 95% CI 0.67 
to 3.83) 
2. Thumb first hand entry (Right: RR 1.34; 95% CI 0.58 to 3.09; Left: RR 1.67; 
95% CI 0.58 to 3.09) 
3. A left hand entering between the midline of the body and the shoulder (RR 1.67; 
95% CI 0.57 to 9.43) 
4. Hand/Arm position where the shoulder is in hyperflexion with the fingers facing 
upward at the end of the entry phase (Right: RR 2.00; 95% CI 0.21 to 4.34; Left: 
RR 1.80; 95% CI 0.33 to 5.00) 
5. Hand position outside the elbow during the early pull through phase (Right: RR 
1.24; 95% CI 0.13 to 3.03; Left: RR 3.00; 95% CI 1.13 to 10.08) 
6. Swimming ‘catch-up’ stroke (Right: RR 1.50; 95% CI 0.67 to 3.34; Left: RR 1.80; 
95% CI 0.33 to 5.00) 
 Conclusion 
In the current study the prevalence of shoulder injuries is alarmingly high at 62.5%.  
Female swimmers seem to be at a higher risk for shoulder injuries than their male 
counterparts.  A relationship between certain freestyle pathomechanics and shoulder 
injuries in this population might exist, and some potential risk factors were identified.  
Due to the relatively small sample size none of the risk factors for shoulder injury, 
based on freestyle pathomechanics, was statistically significant.  Only indications and 
directions for future research can be suggested. 
 Recommendations 
This study was done retrospectively and some data recorded using questionnaires are 
subjected to the memory of the participants.  An obvious shortcoming is the relatively 
small sample size (16 participants) resulting that none of the findings were statistically 
significant, which makes drawing conclusions difficult.  
It is recommended that future research should be focused on injury prevention through 
the development of consensus statements for swimming injuries.  This would further 
our understanding of swimming related injuries and injury prevention.

Freestyle Biomechanics and Shoulder Injuries in Competitive Swimming 
Epidemiologic studies have consistently noted a high incidence and prevalence of 
shoulder pain and dysfunction in competitive swimmers.  Although there is a 
substantial amount of information on risk factors for shoulder injuries in swimmers, up 
to date information on the correlation between specific stroke biomechanical errors 
and shoulder injuries seem to be few and wide spread. 
The goal of this study is to investigate if a correlation between certain freestyle 
biomechanical hand and arm positions and shoulder injuries under swimmers from the 
swimming club Kovsie Aquatics, of the University of the Free State, exist. 
Data on freestyle biomechanics will be gathered through a freestyle stroke 
biomechanics analysis with the Aquanex+Video (underwater camera system).  The 
duration of the analysis is between 30 and 45 minutes, and will be done at swimming 
pool of the University of the Free State.  The following measurements will be taken: 
weight, height, shoulder internal and external rotation.  Medical and training history 
data will be gathered through a survey questionnaire, self-administered under 
classroom-style supervision obtaining information regarding the 2014/2015 swimming 
season (1st of May 2104 to the 30 of April 2015) . 
Your participation in this research project will be greatly appreciated.  Your 
participation is voluntary.  The researcher undertakes to handle all personal 
information in a confidential manner. 
The results of the research study may be used by L.G. du Pisani and/or the 
Department of Exercise and Sport Sciences of the University of the Free State for 
presentations at national / international congresses and for articles published in health 
journals.

Freestyle Biomechanics and Shoulder Injuries in Competitive Swimming 
Research is the process to learn the answer to a question.  L.G. du Pisani and the 
Department of Exercise and Sport Sciences are conducting research on competitive 
swimming at Kovsie Aquatics.  This research is done to improve the understanding of 
the correlation between freestyle biomechanics and shoulder injuries under swimmers 
affiliated with Free State Aquatics. 
Data collected from each participant enrolled in this study will include: 
 A Freestyle Stroke Biomechanics analysis with the Aquanex+Video (an 
underwater camera system).  This will be done at the University of the Free 
State swimming pool. 
 The following measurements will be taken: weight, height, shoulder internal and 
external rotation. 
 Medical and training history through a survey questionnaire, self-administered 
under classroom-style supervision obtaining information regarding the 
2014/2015 swimming season (1st of May 2014 to the 30 of April 2015).  
Participation is voluntary and refusal to participate will involve no penalty or loss of benefits to which the participant is otherwise 
entitled; the participant may discontinue participation at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which the participant is 
otherwise entitled.  
I have read the above and understand the nature of this study.  I understand that by 
participating or allowing my child to participate in this study I may contact the 
researchers at the University of the Free State at any time.  I voluntary agree to 
participate or let my child participate in this study.  I understand that I may refuse that 
me or my child participate and may withdraw from the study at any time without 
prejudice.

Freestyle Biomechanics and Shoulder Injuries in Competitive Swimming 
 
You are being asked to participate in a research study.  Research is the process to 
learn the answer to a question.  L.G. du Pisani and the Department of Exercise and 
Sport Sciences are doing research on competitive swimming at Kovsie Aquatics and 
is inviting you to participate.  In this study we are interested in finding out what in your 
freestyle stroke might cause a shoulder injury. 
 
If you decide to take part in this study, the following will be expected from you: 
 An underwater video of you swimming freestyle will be recorded for analysis.  
When doing this, sensors will be placed between your fingers, which will give 
the researcher feedback on how much force you are generating while 
swimming.  This will be done at the University of the Free State swimming pool. 
 The following measurements will be taken: weight, height, shoulder range of 
motion. 
 You will be asked fill out a questionnaire collecting information on possible 
shoulder injuries, as well your training history, during the last year.  
By signing this you are showing that you understand what is going to be happening 
and have asked any questions you may have about the research. You can also ask 
questions later if you cannot think of them now. Signing this form does not mean you 
have to finish the study – you withdraw from this study at any time without giving 
reasons for doing so.
