Abstract
Spasticity isafrequent chronic complication inindividuals with spinal cord injury (SCI). How-
ever, theseverity ofspasticity varies inpatients with SCI. Therefore, anevaluation method
isneeded todetermine theseverity ofspasticity. Weused acontusive SCImodel thatissuit-
able forclinical translation. Inthisstudy, weexamined thefeasibility oftheswimming test
andanEMG forevaluating spasticity inacontusive SCIratmodel. Sprague-Dawley rats
received aninjury atthe8ththoracic vertebra. Swimming tests were performed 3to6weeks
after SCIinduction. Weplaced theSCI ratsintospasticity-strong orspasticity-weak groups
based onthefrequency ofspastic behavior during theswimming test. Subsequently, we
recorded theHoffman reflex (H-reflex) andexamined theimmunoreactivit yofserotonin (5-
HT)anditsreceptor (5-HT 2A)inthespinal tissues oftheSCI rats. The spasticity-s trong
group hadsignificantly decreased rate-dependent depression oftheH-reflex compared to
thespasticity-weak group. The area of5-HT 2Areceptor immunoreactivity was significantly
increased inthespasticity-strong group. Thus, both electrophysiologica landhistological
evaluations indicate thatthespasticity-strong group presented with amore severe upper
motor neuron syndrome. Wealso observed thegroups intheir cages for20hours. Our
results suggest thattheswimming testprovides anaccurate evaluation ofspasticity inthis
contusive SCImodel. Webelieve thattheswimming testisaneffective method forevaluat-
ingspastic behaviors anddeveloping treatments targeting spasticity after SCI.
Introduction
Spasticity isacommon complication after traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI). Traumatic dis-
connection between theupper and lower motor neurons isknown toresult inhyperexcitability
ofspinal circuits and subsequent spastic symptoms, including muscle spasms, muscular hyper-
tonia, and clonus [1±5]. Spasticity frequently impairs voluntary motor control, and itsseverity
varies among individuals with SCI. Skold etal.(1999) reported that approximately 65±80% of

patients with SCIpresent with muscle spasticity, whereas others have reported that 50±60% of
patients complain ofspastic symptoms that interfere with voluntary motion [2,6,7].Although
aseries ofpharmacological treatments, such asGABA agonists, have been used clinically,
there arestillmany patients with unsolved spastic symptoms. Toimprove upon and develop
new spasticity-targeted therapeutic interventions, theunderlying mechanisms ofspasticity and
voluntary motor control need tobeelucidated.
The pathophysiology ofspasticity hasbeen well studied inrodent models mainly using
complete spinal cord transection models, wherein supraspinal input iscompletely discon-
nected beyond thelesion [8,9].These studies have provided insights into spasticity mecha-
nisms, including exaggerated spinal reflexes, alternations insynapses, and changes inthe
expression ofmotor neuron receptors after SCI[10±16]. However, inflammatory tissue reac-
tions and thespared neural network, which exerts acritical influence onthespinal circuitry
after injury, differ greatly between thecomplete spinalized model and thecontusive model
with incomplete paralysis [17±19]. Considering that most patients with spasticity have atrau-
matic contusive spinal cord injury, using anincomplete contusive rodent model ismore
appropriate forclinical translation than theuseofacomplete model. Although several studies
onspasticity using contusive injury animal models have shown increased muscle resistance
and spinal hyperreflexia after SCI[20±22], individual variation inspastic symptoms remains
anobstacle forthedetailed analysis ofmolecular mechanisms underlying spasticity. Therefore,
methods need tobedeveloped toevaluate spasticity inacontusive SCImodel toenable further
quantification and analysis ofspasticity.
The swimming testisawell-established approach forevaluating behavior after SCI[23, 24].
Gonzenbach etal.(2010) reported muscle spasms inanincomplete transection SCIratmodel
during swimming. However, toourknowledge, there arenocriteria forevaluating spastic
behavior inacontusive SCImodel. Wetherefore attempted touseaswimming testforthe
screening and quantification ofspasticity, aswell astodetermining itsvalidity inacontusive
SCIratmodel. Inparticular, wesought todetermine whether aswimming testcanbeeffec-
tively used toquantify spastic behaviors and todetermine theseverity ofspasticity inacontu-
sive SCIratmodel. These findings areexpected tohelp inthedesign offuture experiments and
representative models used toimprove ourunderstanding ofthemechanisms underlying the
development ofspasticity following SCI.
Materials and methods
Experimental animals, surgery, andpost-operative care
Ten-week-old female Sprague-Dawley rats(n=60,200±300 g,Charles River Japan) were used
inthisexperiment. Fifty ratsreceived thecontusive injury, and 10were used asuninjured con-
trols. The ratswere anesthetized using pentobarbital sodium (50mg/kg, intraperitoneal [I.P.],
Kyoritsu Seiyaku Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) and received a250-kilodyne (kd) contusive
injury from anInfinite Horizon impactor device (Precision Systems and Instrumentation, VA,
USA) atthe8ththoracic level. After surgery, theinjured ratswere treated with asingle shot of
antibiotic (Baytril, 5mg/kg, SC,Bayer). Manual bladder expression wasconducted twice per
dayuntil theinjured ratsspontaneously urinated. The housing room wasunder a12-hour/
12-hour light/dark cycle and thetemperature wasmaintained at23ÊC. Food and water were
suppliedadlibituf. Uninjured ratswere used ascontrols. Allanimal experiments were
approved bytheethical committee oftheNational Rehabilitation Center forPersons with
Disabilities.

Swimming tests
Swimming tests were performed inarectangular Plexiglas chamber (150×14.5×40cm) filled
with tapwater toadepth ofapproximately 20±23 cm.The water temperature wasmaintained
at23ÊC, which isconsidered tobeanoptimal temperature fortheratswimming test[25]. The
swimming direction oftheratswascontrolled from thelefttotheright side ofthechamber
using aramp and anisland attached totheleftside ofthechamber (Fig 1A). Assessment of
swimming wasconducted atapoint 100cmfrom thestarting and ending points. Swimming
from thestart point totheend point wasregarded asasingle runoftheswimming test. We
performed theswimming testover 5runs 3weeks after SCIand over 10runs each 4,5,and 6
weeks after SCI. IftheSCIratshadatleast oneclonus phase oraspastic phase inasingle run
during thetest, they were classified asaªspasticity-positiveº rat(orcecitnciaorcelrsu-asd-ha--
tiehha-n-,-nnthnResults-netirs). Even iftheanimals hadmultiple ormixed phases during a
run, therunwasconsidered tobeaªspasticity-positiveº runbecause itwasdifficult toinde-
pendently determine thespecific episodes. Ifboth spastic and clonus phases were observed
during arun, therunwasclassified asaclonus phase run. Importantly, behaviors related to
defecating orurinating during swimming were excluded. Allswimming tests were videotaped
using aSony Handycam HDR-CX700 camera at60frames persecond.
EMG telemetry implantation andrecording
Weimplanted anEMG telemetry device (model: F40-EET, DSI/Receiver model: RPC-1, DSI,
MN, USA) toobtain EMG data while theratsmoved freely. The EMG telemetry device was
inserted between 3and 4weeks after theSCI. The device wasimplanted atthesame ageinthe
uninjured animals. The rats(n=15)were anesthetized using pentobarbital sodium (50mg/kg,
I.P.). After anesthesia, thebody oftheEMG telemetry device wasinserted subcutaneously into
theneck region and fixed using sutures. The EMG wires were ledviasubcutaneous injection
and implanted intramuscularly into thelefttibial anterialis (TA) muscle, which acts asan
ankle flexor, and theleftmedial gastrocnemius (MG) muscle, which hastheopposite action as
anankle extensor. The wires were tightly fixed using 6±0nylon sutures. EMG recording was
performed atleast 3days after surgery. After EMG implantation, theratswere treated with a
single shot ofantibiotic (Baytril, 5mg/kg, SC). The EMG signal (sampled at1,000 Hz) wasdig-
itized and filtered using ahigh-pass filter (30Hz). EMG recordings were synchronized with a
video recording using alight cuetrigger. Spike2 software (CED, Cambridge, England) was
used fortheEMG recording and analysis. AllEMG recordings were obtained inanelectro-
magnetic-shielded room.
Twenty-hour cage observation
Cage observations were conducted 4weeks after SCIfrom 16:00 onthefirst dayto12:00 on
thefollowing day. Each rat(n=10)with animplanted EMG telemetry device wasindividually
housed inalarge plastic cage (40×25×18cm) under dim light. Video wascaptured using a
web camera during simultaneous EMG recording. EMG recording wassynchronized tothe
video recording using alight-cue trigger. Forquantitative evaluation, wecounted thenumbers
ofclonus and spasm episodes during the20-hour cage observations, which were confirmed
with using EMG recordings (see Results section). Behaviors during defecation orurination
were excluded. The same ratsthat were used forthecage observations were used fortheEMG
recordings onatreadmill (Robomedica, Inc., CA, USA) with body weight support 4weeks
after SCItoexamine muscle activity during voluntary motion. EMG recordings during 10
cycles ofwalking gaits onatreadmill were obtained atarate of7.5m/minute.

Hoffmann reflex (H-reflex) recording
Under chloral hydrate anesthesia (2.5 g/kg, Sigma) delivered viaintraperitoneal injection, we
measured theHoffmann reflex (H-reflex). After anesthesia, theleftorright hindlimb was
incised toexpose thedistal tibial nerve. The Bipolar cuff washooked onto thedistal tibial
nerve atankle level and apair ofrecording electrodes wasinserted into thesame side ofthe
plantar muscle ofhind limb subcutaneously. The distance between therecording electrodes
was3mm and thetipofelectrodes wasexposed toalength ofabout 1.5mm. Aground elec-
trode wasattached tothesurface ofthetail.Todetermine therate-dependent depression
(RDD) oftheHreflex, thetibial nerve wasstimulated at0.2,0.5,1,2,and 5Hzusing astimula-
tor(1±2 Vofintensity, Nihon Kohden, Japan). The EMG signal (sampled at5,000 Hz) was
passed toanamplifier (NEC Biotop 6R12, Nihon Kohden) and band-pass filtered (5±3,000
Hz). Ateach stimulation frequency, 20serial stimulations were performed and thefirst 5
waves were discarded. The amplitudes oftheMwave and theHwave were calculated byaver-
aging 15waves ofeach waveform measured using peak-to-peak values. The rate-dependent
changes ateach stimulation frequency were calculated asapercent oftheresponse at0.2Hz.
Spike2 (CED) wasused forsignal analysis.
Tissue processing andimmunohistochemistry
Sixweeks after SCI, theratswere deeply anesthetized using sodium pentobarbital, perfused
with PBS, and fixed using a4%PFA solution delivered transcardially. The cervical region and
thelumbar region (C1±C3 ofthecervical enlargement and L4±L6 ofthelumbar enlargement,
respectively), and theepicenter oftheSCIwere removed and post-fixed ina4%PFA solution
foranadditional 24hours at4ÊC. The tissues were cuttransversely into 20-μm-thick sections
onacryostat (Leica CM3050S, Leica Microsystems). The tissue sections were incubated with
diluted primary antibodies (goat-anti choline acetyltransferase, 1:100, Millipore; rabbit-anti
serotonin 2Areceptor, 1:200, Calbiochem; rabbit-anti NeuN, 1:500, Millipore; goat-anti sero-
tonin, 1:500, Abcam; mouse-anti glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP], 1:500, Millipore) over-
night. The next day, thesections were incubated with fluorescent secondary antibodies (Alexa
Fluor 488and 568foreach species-of primary antibody, 1:200, Life Technologies) and DAPI
(1:1,000, Sigma) for2hours. Allimages were acquired using aBZ-9000 HSAll-in-one Fluores-
cence Microscope (Keyence BZ-9000).
Quantification anddata analyses
The area ofimmunoreactivity (IR) wasmeasured using Image Jsoftware (National Institutes
ofHealth, USA). Serotonin 2Areceptor (5-HT 2A)levels were measured according tothemeth-
odsdescribed byKong etal.(2011). Inbrief, wesetthresholds forand binarized each image.
Next, wecalculated the5-HT 2Areceptor-labeled area corresponding totheChAT (choline
acetyltransferase)-labeled areas ofthesoma and proximal dendrites ofthespinal motor neu-
rons located intheventral horn. Quantification ofthearea ofserotonin (5-HT) staining was
limited totheventral horn ofthespinal cord. Images oftheventral horn obtained at20× mag-
nification were analyzed for5-HT immunoreactivity. Five sections (each section wasseparated
byover 300μm) were used forimage analyses ofthe5-HT 2Areceptor and 5-HT fibers.
The spared area oftheepicenter oftheinjury wascalculated bymeasuring theGFAP(+)
area ineach spinal section outline area. EMG recordings were obtained and analyzed using
MATLAB software (Mathworks). EMGs obtained over 1second during spastic behaviors were
used todetermine themean amplitude ofmuscle activity. Video analyses and motion captur-
ingwere performed using Vegas Prosoftware (Sony).

Results
Spastic behaviors during swimming: clonus phase andspastic phase
After themid-thoracic SCI, theinjured ratswere almost entirely dependent ontheir forelimbs
during swimming. However, they occasionally used their hindlimbs innormal reciprocal
strokes butwith aslower cycle (<2Hz) compared touninjured rats(4±5 Hz). During thenor-
mal strokes, theinjured ratshadclear reciprocal muscular activations intheir hindlimbs,
although some portions oftheEMG pattern were overlapping (Fig 1B). Wedefined normal
and reciprocal activation ofthehindlimbs astheªnormal stroke phaseº forEMG comparisons.
After atleast 3week ofSCI, theinjured ratshadtypical symptoms ofspasticity during swim-
ming. These symptoms were referred toastheªclonus phaseº ortheªspastic phaseº. The clo-
nusphase presented asrapid (5±8 Hz) jerking movements ofeither oneorboth legs during
swimming (S1Video). During thisphase, simultaneously recorded EMGs showed reciprocal,
high intensity bursts ofTAand MG muscle activity (Fig 1Band 1C). Itisnotable that theclo-
nusphase wasoften observed immediately after theratsstretched orcontracted their hin-
dlimbs. The spastic phase typically presented asaventro-flexed trunk posture with stretched
hind limbs during swimming (Fig 1Band S2Video). Acommon feature ofthespastic phase
wastheextended hindlimb posture, which wasrepresented byco-contraction patterns ofhigh
bursts oftheTAand MG muscle activity. The spastic behaviors, which were divided into the
clonus phase and thespastic phase, were observed either simultaneously orindependently
within asingle swimming runand were easily verified during theswimming test. Given that
some ofthecommon spastic symptoms observed after SCIinclude hyperreflexia, clonus,
hypertonus ofthemuscles, and muscular spasm inboth human patients and animal models
[4,26], wepostulated that theclonus phase and thespastic phase observed during swimming
represent thespastic symptoms ofcontusive SCIrats. The mean amplitude ofmuscle activity
during thespastic phase inSCIratswassignificantly higher than that during thenormal stroke
phase ofboth SCIand uninjured rats(s=4foruninjured rats,s=5forSCIrats, one-way
ANOVA with Tukey'shr-t-hre test; Fig1C). Insummary, thesymptoms ofspasticity inthe
contusive SCIratmodel were observed during theswimming test.
The swimming testcanbeused toclassify SCI ratsaccording to
frequency ofspastic behaviors
Intheswimming experiment, wecalculated thefrequency ofspastic behavior. The histogram
oftheoccurrence frequency indicates theexistence oftwogroups based onspastic behavior
(s=50SCIrats; Fig1D). Because thegroups were apparently divided based on40% frequency,
weused acut-off of40% (i.e., 4ormore ªspasticity-positiveº runs among the10swimming
runs) asthecriterion forgrouping SCIratsinto theªspasticity-strong group.º The other SCI
ratswere grouped into theªspasticity-weak groupº.
Three weeks after SCI, over 50% oftheSCIratswere placed inthespasticity-strong group.
However, some oftheSCIratsinthespasticity-weak group were subsequently classified inthe
spasticity-strong group 4weeks after SCI. The percentage ofratsinthespasticity-strong group
reached aplateau 4to5weeks after SCI(s=36tested SCIrats, Fig1E). The spared tissue area
oftheepicenter oftheinjured site, which wasmeasured bystaining forGFAP 6weeks after
SCI, wasnotsignificantly different between thetwogroups (s=5pergroup, Student's t-test;
Swimming testforspasticity
PLOS ONE |DOI:10.137 1/journal.po ne.0171 937 February 9,2017 6/15
Fig1F). These results indicate that theSCIratscanbegrouped according toseverity based on
theoccurrence frequency ofspastic behaviors, including theclonus phase and thespastic
phase, during theswimming test.
Spasticity during theswimming testwas consistent andreproducible
Todetermine whether theoccurrence ofspastic behaviors and theamplitude ofmuscle activity
ofeach ratchange over time, weperformed theswimming tests weekly from 4to6weeks after
SCI. Inthespasticity-strong group, theoccurrence frequency ofclonus and spastic phases dur-
ingthe10swimming runs wasnotsignificantly different from 3weeks to6weeks after SCI
(s=10,one-way ANOVA with Tukey'shr-t-hre test; Fig2A). Furthermore, themean ampli-
tude ofmuscle activity during spasticity didnotdiffer significantly between testperiods inthe
spasticity-strong group (s=6,Kruskal-Wallis H-test; Fig2B). These results suggest that the
occurrence frequency ofspastic behaviors and theamplitude ofmuscle activity tend tobecon-
sistent during thetime course, atleast over ourobservation period.
The spasticity-strong group hadmore hyperexcitability ofthespinal
reflex circuit
Toexamine differences inthehyperexcitability ofthemonosynaptic lumbar spinal circuit
between thespasticity-strong and spasticity-weak groups, theRDD oftheH-reflex, which is
classically used forevaluating spasticity, wasobtained 6weeks after SCI(Fig 3A). Incontrol
animals, theRDD oftheM-wave wasnotchanged bythestimulation frequency applied and
wasnotsignificantly different between theuninjured group, thespasticity-strong group, and
thespasticity-weak groups (s=7±8pergroup, two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni's hr-t-hre
correction; Fig3B). The RDD oftheH-wave forallSCIrats, including both spasticity-strong
and spasticity-weak groups, wassignificantly lessdepressed than that ofuninjured ratsatstim-
ulation frequencies of2Hzand 5Hz,respectively (s=7foruninjured rats,s=15forSCIrats,
two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni's hr-t-hre correction; Fig3C). The RDD ofthespasticity-
strong group wassignificantly more decreased than that ofthespasticity-weak group atthe
stimulation frequency of5Hz.Furthermore, only thespasticity-strong group hadstatistically
significant differences atstimulation frequencies of1Hz,2Hz,and 5Hzcompared tothe
uninjured group (n=7±8pergroup, two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni's hr-t-hre correction;
Fig3D). These results suggest that thespasticity-strong group ofSCIratshadmore hyperexcit-
ability ofthelumbar circuit than thespasticity-weak group, which isconsistent with theresults
ofthebehavioral screening performed during theswimming test.
The spasticity-strong group hasmore up-regulated serotonin receptor
expression inspinal motor neurons
Todetermine other factors that might influence thevariation between thespasticity groups,
weexamined serotonin (5-HT) fibers and 5-HT 2Areceptors inboth pre(cervical) and lower
(lumbar) regions based onareport byKong etal.(2011), who showed that expression ofthe
serotonin 2Areceptor wasrobustly increased after spinal cord transection inaratmodel. Con-
sistent with previous results, theIRofthe5-HT 2Areceptor wasgreatly upregulated inthe
region below theepicenter ofthespinal cord after SCI(Fig 4A). Furthermore, expression of
the5-HT 2Areceptor inthelumbar motor neurons ofthespasticity-strong group wassignifi-
cantly more upregulated compared tothat ofthespasticity-weak group (s=5±6pergroup,
one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni's hr-t-hre correction; Fig4B). Conversely, thepositive area
ofthe5-HT fibers intheventral horn ofthelumbar spinal cord wassignificantly reduced after
Swimming testforspasticity
PLOS ONE |DOI:10.137 1/journal.po ne.0171 937 February 9,2017 7/15
SCIwhen compared tothat oftheuninjured rats. The 5-HT-positive area inthespasticity-
strong group wasalso decreased when compared tothat ofthespasticity-weak group. How-
ever, thisdifference wasnotstatistically significant (s=5±6pergroup, one-way ANOVA with
Bonferroni's hr-t-hre correction; Fig4Cand 4D). The IRareas of5-HT 2Areceptors and 5-HT
fibers intheventral horn ofthecervical spinal cord didnotshow anysignificant differences
between groups (s=5±6pergroup, one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni's hr-t-hre correction;
Fig4Cand 4D). Plots ofreserved 5-HT fibers and expression patterns ofthe5-HT 2Areceptor
ineach animal suggest thepresence ofastrong relationship between thereserved 5-HT fiber
area and 5-HT 2Areceptor density inthelumbar spinal cord (r2=0.602, p=0.001, logarithmic
regression analysis; Fig4E). The plot inFig4Ealso shows that uninjured ratshave high 5-HT/
5-HT 2ARratios, while spasticity-strong ratshave low5-HT/5-HT 2ARratios and spasticity-
weak ratshave intermediate ratios. These results indicate that thealtered 5-HT/5-HT 2ARratio
inthelumbar spinal cord may correlate with thefrequency ofspastic behaviors observed in
theswimming test.
Types andoccurrence ofspastic behaviors during the20-hour
observation period confirm theresults oftheswimming test
Toexamine thecorrelation between spastic symptoms observed intheswimming test(Fig 1)
and spastic behaviors under free-moving conditions ontheground, weconducted EMG
recordings ofthesame SCIrats, which were tested and grouped using theswimming test, over
20hours. The recordings were synchronized with video capture during normal behavior ina
housing cage. Four weeks after SCI, theSCIratshadanepisodic EMG pattern corresponding
toaclonus orspasm episode inacage situation (Fig 5A). Clonus during cage observations
occurred episodically and wasspontaneously accompanied bylong-term (over 3seconds
based ontheEMG recordings) reciprocal bursts ofTAand MG muscle activity and abnormal
motions, such aswhirling ofthetail(S3Video). Spasms during thecage observations also
occurred spontaneously with hyper-stretched limbs orhyper-contracted limbs, even when the

ratswere apparently sleeping orresting (S4Video). The EMG patterns ofthespasms during
cage observations were represented bysimultaneous and extensive bursts ofTAand MG mus-
cleactivities. Since themuscle activities obtained during continuous gaits intheinjured rats
could notbeassessed under normal cage conditions, weobtained abaseline amplitude forthe
gaitonthetreadmill. The mean amplitude ofspastic muscle activity during thecage observa-
tions wassignificantly higher than that observed over 10gaitcycles onabody weight-sup-
ported treadmill inthesame rats(s=5,Student's t-test; Fig5B). The spasticity-strong group,
which wasassigned based ontheresults oftheswimming test, hadsignificantly more spasm
and clonus episodes than thespasticity-weak group during the20-hour observation period
(s=5pergroup, Student's t-test; Fig5C). Although wealso observed some specific types of
spasms, such asextensor (MG)-related spasms orflexor (TA)-related spasms, these were not
analyzed. Uninjured ratsdidnothave anyspasm orclonus episodes during the20-hour obser-
vation period (s=3).The average counted number ofspasm and clonus episodes peaked in
theearly morning (08:00±09:00) and early evening (17:00±19:00) (s=5pergroup; Fig5D),
which isconsistent with other reports regarding thespastic symptoms ofratsand humans [25,
27]. These results indicate that thespasticity-strong group ofSCIratshadmore severe spastic-
itysymptom than thespasticity-weak group during cage observation aswell asduring the
swimming test.

Discussion
Weobserved spastic behaviors during aswimming testincontusive SCIrats. The spastic
behavior consisted ofclonus and spastic phases. These behaviors were easily reproducible and
detectable, and could bereadily quantified based onoccurrence frequency. Inaddition, the
swimming testcould discriminate SCIratswith different severities ofspasticity. Weused this
testtoclassify theratsinto thespasticity-strong group and thespasticity-weak group based on
theoccurrence frequency ofthespastic behaviors. Weconfirmed thefeasibility ofthisgroup-
ingusing theH-reflex test, immunohistochemistry fortheserotonin receptor, and the20-hour
cage observations. Allmeasures consistently showed that thespasticity-strong group, which

wasassigned based ontheswimming test, hadmore severe changes related toupper motor
neuron syndrome compared tothespasticity-weak group. Furthermore, thepercentage ofSCI
ratsthat were placed inthespasticity-strong group and thetime course ofspasticity after SCI
arelargely consistent with theresults ofaprevious study using anincomplete transection rat
model [25]. Therefore, theswimming testresults reflect theseverity ofupper motor neuron
syndrome, atleast tosome extent.
While weobserved variations inseverity among thespasticity-strong and spasticity-weak
groups intheswimming test, weassume that ourdivision into thetwogroups isreliable based
ontheresults ofmultiple other modalities. Considering that incomplete SCIresults invarious
degrees ofspasticity (2,6,7),itisimportant toobtain homogenous experimental groups for
SCIresearch. Wethus suggest that theswimming testisauseful screening tool forincomplete
SCImodels.

Wetested thehyperexcitability ofthelumbar spinal circuit using theH-reflex test, which is
astandard method ofmeasuring hyperreflexia inboth humans and animal models [15, 17,28,
29]. Wefound that thespasticity-strong group hadlower RDDs intheH-reflex, aswell as
increased expression ofthe5-HT 2Areceptor inthelumbar spinal motor neurons compared
with thespasticity-weak group. Overexpression ofthe5-HT receptor causes supersensitivity to
serotonin, which isrelated tospasticity [30]. Therefore, weexpected that such supersensitivity
toserotonin, caused bytheoverexpression ofserotonin receptors, may betheprimary reason
forthereduced RDD inthespasticity-strong group.
Supersensitivity ofserotonin and up-regulation ofserotonin receptors below theinjury site
after SCIhave previously been reported toberelated tothehyperexcitability ofspinal motor
neurons and consequent spasticity [13, 14,16,31±33]. Itisknown that several types of5-HT 2
receptors, such as5-HT 2A,5-HT 2B,and 5-HT 2C,areclosely related tothehyperexcitability of
motor neurons after SCI[14]. However, immunohistochemical studies have clearly shown
robust elevation ofthe5-HT 2Areceptor after SCIand reported theupregulation ofmRNA for
thisreceptor [34, 35]. Therefore, weselected the5-HT 2Areceptor asarepresentative serotonin
receptor that ismainly expressed inspinal motor neurons forthepresent immunohistochem-
istry analysis [34, 36]. Our results indicate acorrelation between thedegree ofserotonin super-
sensitivity and theseverity ofspasticity given thesame severity ofSCI.
During the20-hour cage observations, wenoted some spasticity-related behaviors inthe
ªspasticity-weakº rats. Nevertheless, thetotal occurrence ofspasm and clonus episodes wassig-
nificantly lower inthisgroup than inthespasticity-strong group. Therefore, ourresults suggest
that theseverity ofspasticity inacontusive SCIratmodel may bereflected bytheoccurrence
frequency ofspastic behaviors.
Our assessment using behavioral features may notdirectly reflect velocity-dependent mus-
clerigidity, which istheclassical criterion forspasticity [37]. Itshould benoted that there are
other established assays that useankle-rotation evoked EMG responses (21, 22). Nevertheless,
according toourEMG and H-reflex results, thebehavioral patterns oftheSCIratsduring the
swimming testcorrespond well topatterns ofspastic symptoms observed inhuman patients
with respect to1)muscle spasms, 2)clonus, 3)co-contraction ofthemuscles, and 4)hyperto-
niaand hyperreflexia. Therefore, theswimming testisable toshow direct manifestations of
clinically relevant symptoms ofspasticity and may beuseful forsubsequent behavioral assess-
ments. This testprovides anadvantage inprospective design bydefining homogenous
samples.
Our study hasseveral limitations. First, thecorrelation ofspastic behavior frequency
during theswimming testand theHreflex testwas notperfectly matched. Despite this limi-
tation, webelieve that theswimming testisuseful forscreening incomplete SCI rats to
obtain more homogenous experimental groups. Second, spastic behaviors during theswim-
ming testmay notbeable tobeused todiscriminate between voluntary attempts and invol-
untary movements. However, wefound that those behaviors were unique, which allowed us
todistinguish between thespasticity-strong and spasticity-weak groups. Furthermore, the
behavioral assessment hastheadvantages ofease and repeatability forlongitudinal
experiments.
Insummary, ourresults show that quantification and screening ofspasticity incontusive
SCI rats ispossible bymeasuring theoccurrence frequency ofspastic behaviors during a
swimming test. Our results may help todiscriminate spasticity-weak rats from spasticity-
strong rats after SCI. Taken together, ourfindings suggest that theswimming testisaneffec-
tivemethod forevaluating symptoms ofspasticity and developing treatments targeting spas-
ticity after SCI.
