Context: Swimmers are known for experiencing high
training loads and a high incidence of overuse injuries, but fewresearchers have investigated the relationship between the two
at the collegiate level.
Objective: To determine the association between workload
and noncontact musculoskeletal injury in collegiate swimmers.
Design: Prospective cohort study.
Setting: College natatorium.
Patients or Other Participants: A total of 37 National
Collegiate Athletic Association Division III swimmers, 26
uninjured (age ¼19 years [interquartile range ¼3 years], height
¼175611 cm, mass ¼70.2610 kg) and 11 injured (age ¼19
years [interquartile range ¼3 years], height ¼17369 cm, mass
¼69.4613.5 kg) individuals.
Main Outcome Measure(s): Logistic regression using
generalized estimating equations was conducted to calculate
odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs for injury relative to high
workloads and high acute:chronic workload ratio (ACWRs).Injury rates for several ranges of workloads and ACWRs were
also calculated.
Results: A total of 11 participants (29.7%) sustained 12
injuries, with 7 injuries occurring during the participants’ winter
training trip. Injury was associated with high acute workloads (OR
¼27.1; 95% CI ¼8.2, 89.8) and high ACWRs (OR ¼25.1; 95% CI
¼7.7, 81.4) but not high chronic (OR ¼2.6; 95% CI ¼0.3, 20.0) or
overall (OR ¼1.00; 95% CI ¼0.99, 1.01) workloads. High acute
workloads ( .37.2 km/wk) and ACWRs ( .1.56) increased the
injury rate from /C201% to 15% and 14%, respectively, compared
with all lower acute workloads and ACWRs.
Conclusions: Collegiate swimmers tolerated high work-
loads spread out during the season. However, caution should
be used when prescribing high acute workloads and highACWRs (eg, winter training trip) because of the increased odds
of injury.
Key Words: training monitoring, acute workload, chronic
workload
Key Points
/C15For their student-athletes, collegiate swim coaches may prescribe high overall workloads spread out over the
season without risking increased odds of injury.
/C15However, coaches should be cautious in prescribing high acute workloads (ie, weekly workloads) and highacute:chronic workload ratios (ie, the ratio of the acute workload to the current month’s chronic workload).
/C15Given the concentrated number of injuries during the winter training trip, coaches should carefully weigh theperformance beneﬁts of these trips against the increased odds of injury.
Competitive swimmers are well known for experi-
encing both high workloads1–3and a high incidence
of overuse injuries.3,4These overuse injuries may
reﬂect errors in the workload prescription (eg, sudden
increases in training volume or intensity).5However, in
reviews of injury risk factors in swimmers, researchers6,7
have drawn mixed conclusions on the relationship between
workload and injury. In a recent systematic review,6the
investigators found moderate-quality evidence for highworkloads increasing the injury risk in adolescent swim-mers but low-quality evidence in older and younger
swimmers. The lack of high-quality evidence for college-
aged swimmers (age range ¼18–22 years) was unexpected,
given that they undertake the highest workloads.
6Only 2 ofthe 12 studies in the systematic review6were prospective.8,9
In both prospective studies, the authors observed no
association between workload and injury, although 1 study8
was limited by 85% missing data. Additional prospective
evidence is needed, especially in collegiate swimmers.
An emerging method for assessing the relationship
between workload and injury is the acute:chronic workload
ratio (ACWR).10The ACWR is typically calculated as the
workload during the most recent week (acute) divided bythe workload during the most recent 4 weeks (chronic).This metric is thought to be more relevant to injury thanacute or chronic workload alone.
10High ACWRs have been
associated with injury in several sports (eg, cricket, rugby,
and Australian football).10The current evidence suggests a
470 Volume 57 /C15Number 5 /C15May 2022
‘‘danger zone ’’for increased injury risk when the ACWR
exceeds 1.5 (ie, acute workload 50% higher than thechronic workload).
10Although no researchers have mea-
sured the ACWR in swimmers, Sein et al3did provide a
danger zone for average weekly workload in their cross-sectional study of elite swimmers aged 13 to 25 years.Swimming .35 km/wk increased the risk of supraspinatus
tendinopathy 4-fold compared with all lower workloads.
3A
metric such as this for the ACWR in swimming could helpcoaches plan training.
11In fact, multiple authors4,6,11have
called for an ACWR-type analysis in swimmers.
The purpose of our prospective surveillance study was to
determine the extent to which workload was associated
with noncontact musculoskeletal injury in collegiateswimmers. We hypothesized that higher overall workloads(kilometers swum throughout the season) would beassociated with increased odds of noncontact musculoskel-etal injury. We also hypothesized that high ACWRs wouldbe more strongly associated with odds of noncontact
musculoskeletal injury than would high acute or chronic
workloads alone.
METHODS
Participants
For this prospective cohort study, we recruited partici-
pants at a preseason team meeting of 1 National CollegiateAthletic Association (NCAA) Division III swim team.Athletes were eligible for inclusion if they were at least 18years old and medically cleared to participate in sport.
Volunteers who were non-English speakers and were
unable to provide consent were excluded. A sample-sizecalculation for this study was based on the coach-reportedinjury incidence from the previous season (27%) and theneed for a minimum of 10 injuries for logistic regression.
12
This calculation suggested a minimum of 37 participantswere required. Forty-one student-athletes provided written
informed consent to participate during their 2018–2019
season and 37 completed the season (Table 1). This study,which the Drexel University Institutional Review Boardapproved, was part of a larger study in which intrinsic riskfactors for injury were also examined.
Procedures
The swim coach provided practice attendance, team
training, and competition logs throughout the season. At thebeginning of the season and during breaks in mandatorytraining (eg, Thanksgiving break, winter break), partici-
pants self-reported their preseason and self-directed work-
loads, respectively, via the Research Electronic DataCapture Web application (REDCap). Participants who didnot respond to any questionnaire received 2 follow-upemail reminders. The return rates for preseason and in-season REDCap workload questionnaires were 100% and95.5%, respectively, resulting in 5 (0.6%) athlete-weeks of
imputed data using team averages. Most training took place
in a 25-yd (22.5-m) pool. We converted workloads in yardsto kilometers. Our preliminary work veriﬁed the coach-reported workloads, with student-athletes completing anaverage of 97% 63% (range ¼89%–103%) of the
workloads indicated on the logs.We deﬁned injury as any noncontact musculoskeletal
pain that resulted from team activities and prevented theswimmer from participating in a competition or at least50% of 1 practice as prescribed. This deﬁnition is similar tothat of interfering pain in a previous study
8but has a
concrete threshold for interference of 50%. We chose thisdeﬁnition based on evidence that high-volume swimmersh a dh i g hp a i nt h r e s h o l d s ,
13and swimmers tended to
continue training despite pain.2As a result, only about 3
in 10 injuries caused time loss in swimmers.4Thus, the 50%
threshold included pain that did not result in complete timeloss but still substantially interfered with training. Alongwith the practice attendance and training logs, the swim
coach completed weekly injury reports. When the coach
reported that a student-athlete had sustained an injury, thatindividual received a REDCap questionnaire in which he orshe veriﬁed the injury, selected the mechanism (contact,noncontact, or overuse), described it in detail, and indicatedthe number of days affected (see Supplemental Figure,available online at http://dx.doi.org/10.4085/1062-6050-0135.21.S1). An injury episode ended when the swimmerreturned to full sport participation. At the midpoint and endof the season, participants also described (via REDCap) anyinjuries they had not previously reported. They returned93.2% of these questionnaires. Although using electronicmedical records is the norm for NCAA injury surveillance,
4
the college’s athletic trainer discouraged querying theserecords because of the potential for underreporting. Forsports with predominantly overuse injury mechanisms, theuse of periodic self-report questionnaires has been encour-
aged.

Data Analysis
We calculated weekly workloads (Monday through
Sunday) for each participant based on practice attendanceand team training or competition logs. We categorizedworkload in 4 ways: (1) overall workload throughout theseason, (2) acute workload, (3) chronic workload, and (4)ACWR. Overall workload was the number of kilometersTable 1.

swum over the entire season.15Acute workload for each
week was the number of kilometers swum that week.Chronic workload for each week was the average
kilometers swum per week over that week and the
preceding 3 weeks. The ACWR for each week was the
quotient of the acute workload and chronic workload.
10
During the ﬁrst 3 weeks of the season, self-reportedpreseason workloads factored into the chronic workload
and ACWR calculations. We calculated all workloads using
Excel (version 16; Microsoft Corp).
Statistical Analysis
The Shapiro-Wilk test and visual inspection of histo-
grams were performed to determine the normality of all
data. We used mean 6SD to describe normally distributed
data and median (interquartile range [IQR]) to describe
nonnormally distributed data. We conducted independent-
samples ttests to assess differences in descriptive data
between injured and uninjured student-athletes except for
age and months per year swum (Mann-Whitney Utests)
and sex and training groups (Fisher exact test).
For the ﬁrst hypothesis, we used logistic regression to
assess the association between the overall workloadthroughout the season (continuous independent variable)
and injury (binary dependent variable). For the second
hypothesis, we pooled the data for each of the other 3
workload categorizations (acute workload, chronic work-
load, and ACWR) for all athlete-weeks of training. We thendichotomized each workload categorization into high or
typical . Because the pooled workload data were not
normally distributed, outliers (third quartile þ[1.53
IQR]) signiﬁed high workloads and ACWRs. We denoted
all other workloads and ACWRs as typical. We calculated 3
logistic regression models (1 for each workload categori-
zation) using generalized estimating equations to assess the
association between workload (the dichotomized indepen-dent variable) and injury during each athlete-week (the
binary dependent variable). The generalized estimating
equations accounted for repeated measures. Logisticregression provided odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs.
Finally, the injury rate for a given range of acute workloads
and ACWRs represented the number of injuries thatoccurred within that range divided by the total number of
athlete-weeks in that range. The alevel was set at .05. We
completed all statistical analyses using SPSS (version 24;
IBM Corp).
RESULTS
The 2018–2019 season spanned 21 or 22 weeks,
depending on whether the swimmer qualiﬁed for the end-
of-season championship meet. Competitions began in week
5. Final examinations and winter break interruptedmandatory team practice from weeks 12 to 15. After
returning from winter break in week 16, the team went on a
trip for 10 days of high-volume training. Before mid-
season, 4 student-athletes quit the team (reasons unknown),
leaving 37 participants. Data from the 37 student-athleteswho completed the season yielded a total of 809 athlete-
weeks.
Of the 37 participants, 11 (29.7%) sustained 12 injuries.
No differences existed in characteristics, training groups,months per year swum, or swimming experience between
the uninjured and injured student-athletes (Table 1). Eight
injuries were to the shoulder, 3 were to the back orsacroiliac joint, and 1 was to the knee. Participants
described the mechanism of 11 injuries as overuse and 1
asoverstretching . Ten injuries were incurred in the water; 2
were incurred on dry land. Participation time altered or lost
ranged from 1 day to 2 weeks, with a median (IQR) of 2(10) days. Nine of the 12 injuries affected participation for
/C204 days. One injury occurred in each of weeks 1, 3, 4, 5,
and 18. Seven injuries (6 shoulder and 1 back, all self-
reported overuse mechanisms) occurred in week 16.
A sample participant’s workload throughout the season is
shown in Figure 1. Across participants, the median (IQR)
overall workload throughout the entire season was 532 (65)km, which corresponded to a weekly workload of 24.2 (3.4)
km. No association existed between overall workload and
injury (OR ¼1.00; 95% CI ¼0.99, 1.01; Figure 2). The
demarcations for high acute and chronic workloads and
ACWR were 37.2 km/wk and 1.56, respectively. Injury wasassociated with both a high acute workload and a high
ACWR but not a high chronic workload (Table 2, Figure 3).

472 Volume 57 /C15Number 5 /C15May 2022
ACWR athlete-weeks ranged from 28 (3.5%) to 49 (6.1%;
Table 2). Of the 49 high ACWR athlete-weeks and 46 highacute workload athlete-weeks, 32 involved both a high
ACWR and a high acute workload. Most high acute
workload athlete-weeks (n ¼35/46; 76.1%) and high
ACWR athlete-weeks (n ¼31/49; 63.3%) coincided with
the winter training trip (week 16). All 7 of the injuries
during week 16 occurred in the presence of a high acuteworkload and high ACWR. The injury rate was /C201% for
typical acute workloads and ACWRs, 15% for high acute
workloads, and 14% for high ACWRs (Figure 4).
DISCUSSION
The purpose of our study was to prospectively determine
the association between workload and noncontact muscu-loskeletal injury in collegiate swimmers. The data did not
support our ﬁrst hypothesis: we found no associationbetween overall workload and injury. Our second hypoth-
esis was partially supported. We found that a high ACWRwas strongly associated with injury, whereas a high chronicworkload was not. Contrary to our hypothesis, a high acuteworkload was also associated with injury.
Overall Workload and Injury
The lack of association between overall workload and
injury was consistent with that reported in a previousstudy
16of collegiate swimmers. Most researchers who
examined college-aged swimmers along with younger andolder swimmers also found no relationship between overallworkload and injury.
8,9,16–20The authors of only 2
studies3,15that included college-aged swimmers along with
other age groups provided evidence for an associationbetween high overall workloads and injury. The contrastingﬁndings from those 2 studies could be due to differences inage ranges and injury deﬁnitions.
6The age ranges reported
by Sein et al3and Ristolainen et al15were 13 to 25 and 15 to
35 years, respectively. In a recent systematic review, Feijen
et al6suggested that adolescent swimmers may be at high
risk of load-related injuries because they have not reachedfull musculoskeletal and psychosocial maturity. Comparedwith youth swimmers, athletes who choose to continueswimming in college may be better able to withstand therigors of high workloads (the ‘‘healthy athlete effect ’’).
21
Meanwhile, 1 investigation22of masters swimmers (age
.23 years) showed that those with shoulder pain had
higher workloads than did those without shoulder pain. Inaddition, whereas we studied interfering pain anywhere inthe body, Sein et al
3studied shoulder pain only and
included all severities.
Acute Workload, Chronic Workload, and ACWR and
Injury
We observed that high ACWR was no more strongly
associated with injury than was high acute workload alone.Although earlier research
23,24supported the ACWR model
of Gabbett,10our data did not. Injuries tended to occur as
often during weeks with high acute workloads as duringweeks with high ACWRs. These results are consistent witha recent analysis
25of data from 34 elite footballers in
which the authors noted that ACWR was no more strongly
associated with injury than was acute workload alone oreven acute workload scaled by a random chronic workload.In our study, considerable overlap ( .65%) existed between
high ACWR weeks and high acute-workload weeks. Ourﬁndings could be attributed to the nature of this team’s
training program, which had small week-to-week ﬂuctua-
tions, except for the training trip in week 16. Anotherpossible explanation for the lower-than-expected associa-tion between ACWR and injury could be self-report andrecall biases. Two injuries occurred during the ﬁrst 3weeks of the season, during which time the participants’self-reported preseason workloads factored into calcula-
tions for the ACWR. Overestimation of preseason
workloads could have resulted in underestimation ofACWRs.
Previous researchers
11have expressed concerns about an
elevated load-related injury risk during winter trainingtrips. We are the ﬁrst, to our knowledge, to corroboratethese concerns with workload surveillance. Seven of the

12 injuries in this study occurred during the winter
training trip. Swimming tradition dictates that the purpose
of the training trip is to expose the student-athletes to high
acute workloads.11In fact, it is common practice to plan
the highest workloads of the season for 6 weeks before theend-of-season competition.
26Based on supercompensation
theory, these workloads are believed to facilitate enhanced
performance after tapering for the end-of-season compe-
tition.1Fittingly, 35 (94.6%) of 37 student-athletes
encountered a high acute workload ( .37.2 km/wk) during
the training trip, and 31 (83.8%) student-athletes encoun-
tered a high ACWR ( .1.56). Five of the 7 injuries during
the training trip affected /C204 training days. However, the
potential long-term effects of these injuries cannot be
determined from these data. Regardless, these results raiseconcerns about whether the performance beneﬁts of a
traditional training trip outweigh the increased injury
odds.
Because our workload data were not normally distribut-
ed, we demarcated high workloads and ACWR via outliers.
Ahigh ACWR was.1.56, which aligns with the danger
zone of /C211.5 that Gabbett
10proposed. A high acute
workload was.37.2 km/wk; this value is similar to that
reported by Sein et al3(35 km/wk) for an increased risk of
supraspinatus tendinopathy. However, their metric corre-
sponded with the average weekly workload (akin to our
overall workload) and not acute workload. Workloadclassiﬁcations based on SDs above the mean workload or
ACWR have been used previously.
23Had we used 1 SD
above the mean, our demarcations would have been lower:
33.4 km for high acute workloads, 30.5 km for high chronic
workloads, and 1.39 for ACWRs. These values would havereduced the associations with injury by classifying more
athlete-weeks as high workload or ACWR without a
commensurate increase in injuries. Given these data, we
recommend adopting outlier-based values for high ACWR
and high acute workload. Future authors should validate the
demarcations from our study among larger, diverse samples
of swimmers. Swim teams with workloads much differentfrom those of the team in this study may require different
values. Furthermore, we caution coaches against treating
acute workloads .37.2 km or ACWRs .1.56 as values
student-athletes should never exceed. Instead, coaches
should continually monitor student-athletes’ well-beingand readiness to determine whether they are prepared for
a certain workload.
27Methodological Considerations and Limitations
Our injury deﬁnition yielded injury mechanisms, time
loss, and injured body regions consistent with epidemio-logic data.
4,28Our methodological choice to rely on coach
and student-athlete reports yielded 11 injured participants
(29.7% of the sample). Although a student-athlete seeking
medical attention did not constitute an injury in our study,we asked participants whether they had done so in ourquestionnaires. Only 4 of the 11 student-athletes reportedseeking medical attention for their injury, which supportsour methodological choice of coach- and self-report. Givenour injury deﬁnition and reporting methods, overuse wasthe predominant injury mechanism, accounting for all but 1injury. This ﬁnding is consistent with observations in aprior epidemiologic study
4of collegiate swimmers, in
which overuse was the most common injury mechanism. In
addition, only 3 injuries affected participation for .4 days.
These outcomes also correspond with epidemiologic datashowing that swimming had the lowest rate of severeinjuries (based on time loss) across NCAA sports.
28
Because swimmers tend to continue training in the presenceof pain, however, this low severe injury rate likelyunderrepresents their prevalence of pain.
2,3Finally, also
in keeping with epidemiology data, the injured bodyregions we observed (shoulder, trunk, and knee) align with
those in a previous epidemiologic report on collegiate
swimmers.
4Most of the swimming literature has been
focused on the shoulder. Because nearly two-thirds ofcollegiate swimming injuries affect body regions other thanthe shoulder,
4we recommend future investigations of
injuries to all body regions and not just the shoulder.
The small number of participants and injuries in this
study meant that the 95% CIs surrounding the ORs for bothacute workload (95% CI ¼8.2, 89.8) and ACWR (95% CI ¼
7.7, 81.4) were wide. Based on these wide CIs, readersshould interpret the magnitude of the associations we notedwith caution. To improve precision, future studies wouldbeneﬁt from multiteam samples or data from 1 team over
several seasons. Furthermore, in addition to swimming,
participants engaged in strength training. However, we didnot assess the possible inﬂuence of strength training oninjury. Moreover, it was not feasible to measure thestudent-athletes’ internal workload (ie, heart rate or ratingof perceived exertion), which represents their physiologicalor psychological response to imposed external workloads
Figure 4. Compared with lower ranges of (A) acute workloads and (B) acute:chronic workload ratios (ACWRs), injury rates during the
season increased by an order of magnitude with acute workloads .37.2 km/wk and ACWRs .1.56 (from /C201% for all lower ranges to 15%
and 14% for the high acute workloads and high ACWRs, respectively).
Journal of Athletic Training 475
(distance swum).27With that said, researchers29studying
swimmers have shown a strong correlation between rating
of perceived exertion and distance swum ( r¼0.71).
Nevertheless, the relationship between injury and combinedinternal and external workload in swimmers remains
unknown. In addition, in this study, external swimming
workloads were coach- and self-reported. In accordancewith our preliminary work verifying coach-reported
workloads, authors
30found that student-athletes complied
with coach-prescribed training volume at a high rate. A lowpercentage of missing data further strengthened ourworkload data. Thus, although our data were limited to
coach- and self-reported external swimming workloads,
high compliance and response rates bolstered the dataﬁdelity. Finally, our analyses did not incorporate intrinsicrisk factors for injury. Given the multifactorial nature of an
injury, a comprehensive approach to reducing risk should
consider both extrinsic and intrinsic factors.
31
CONCLUSIONS
High acute workload and ACWR were both associated
with injury in collegiate swimmers; high overall and
chronic workloads were not. Therefore, collegiate coachesmay prescribe high workloads spread out over the seasonwithout increased injury odds. However, they should be
cautious in prescribing high acute workloads and high
ACWRs. In this sample, acute workloads .37.2 km/wk and
ACWRs .1.56 corresponded with increases in injury rates,
from/C201% for typical workloads and ACWRs to 15% for
high acute workloads and 14% for high ACWRs. More than
half of the injuries occurred during the team’s wintertraining trip. These data raise concerns about the risk of
these high acute-workload trips, particularly when they
occur after ﬁnal examinations and winter break, which areoften periods of reduced workloads. Moreover, one-third ofthe observed injuries occurred during the ﬁrst 5 weeks of
the season. Considering the potential inaccuracy of the self-
reported preseason workload in this study, swimmers maystill beneﬁt from focusing on building their chronicworkload in the preseason.
