ABSTRACT  
No prior investigations have evaluated the musculoskeletal (MSK) injuries charact eristic to swimming sport in 
Jordan. This study aimed to identify the most common sports injuries among male and fem ale swimmers in 
Jordan. Through a survey distributed to the Jordanian Swimming Federation ’s registered swimmers, 173 
participants (72 female, 101 male) aged 18 to 25 completed the questionnaire. The results of  the study showed 
that the most common injuries were arranged as follows: muscle spasm, muscle cramps and sprains; 29.8% , 
28.6% and 17.7%, respectively. The most vulnerable areas were Shoulder 35.3%, followed by the back 14.4 %, 
knee 10.7% and neck 10.2%. The most common cause of injuries were Inadequate warm up where hi s 
percentage reached 34% followed by Overtraining with a percentage of 27%. Reduc ed training intensity or 
frequency,  impaired stroke technique , limited range of motion or flexibility and  required complete cessation 
of swimming had the main effectiveness the swimming performance and training ,were  the percent was 34.9%, 
20.8%,10.3% and 4.3% , respectively.

INTRODUCTION: 
Swimming is an exercise that engages most of the 
body's muscles, promoting physical efficiency and 
improving physiological aspects. It enhances resis-
tance to diseases, boosts self-confidence, and aids in 
leisure time management while enhancing mental 
capabilities. Swimming is a comprehensive exercise 
that carries both physical benefits and injury risks. The 
study focuses on understanding and preventing muscu-
loskeletal injuries in Jordanian swimmers, considering 
various factors that influence injury occurrence and 
their impact on performance. The research aims to 
enhance knowledge of swimming-related injuries and 
contribute to the development of injury prevention 
strategies (Trikha, 2022).  
The science of sports injuries plays a vital role in 
sports medicine, focusing on the diagnosis and preven-
tion of injuries. It enhances athletes' awareness of 
injury causes and preventive measures, highlighting 
the need for specialized training and first aid. Fatigue, 
stress, and excessive training pressure contribute to 
sports injuries (Struck et al.,  2020; Croteau et al.,  
2021). Swimming, a low-impact exercise, is popular in 
coastal regions, emphasizing the importance of under-
standing swimming-related injuries and their preven-
tion. This research explores musculoskeletal injuries 
among Jordanian swimmers, aiming to identify injury 
types, causes, and their impact on performance. The 
study utilizes mixed methods, incorporating quanti-

and physical examinations, with a focus on gender, 
age, swimming styles, starting age, training time, dis-
tance, and competitiveness (McLean et al.,  2020). 
 
MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
The data collection method chosen for this study 
involved conducting an internet-based survey, specifi-
cally utilizing Qualtrics survey software due to its 
accessibility and the availability of diverse question 
formats. The survey was directed at 195 swimmers 
who were affiliated with the Jordanian Swimming 
Federation. Data was collected through an extensive 
survey distributed to adult swimmers aged 18 and 
older. Statistical analysis, including calculations of 
frequencies, percentages, mean sand standard dev ia-
tions was performed using SPSS. Various statistical 
techniques were applied during the analysis, and ethi-cal considerations played a central role in the rese-arch 
process, ultimately enhancing the reliability of the 
findings regarding musculoskeletal injuries in Jordan-
ian swimmers.

main types of medical treatment that participants have 
received. Physical therapy was the main type with 
86% followed by the surgery of 3% and medication 
treatment of 26 %. With respect to applying modifi-
cations to swimming technique or training routine in 
order to reduce their injuries in the future 72.2% of 
them said yes and of 27.8% said no. Participants were 
also asked if they were aware of any exercises or 
specific stretches that can help prevent swimming 
injuries, 63.3% answered yes and 36.7% said no. Fig. 
6 demonstrates how critical is to perform warming up 
and stretching exercises for injury prevention, where 
according to Likert scale, 62 % strongly agreed, 26% 
agreed 7 % were neutral, and those who disagreed were 
only 0.5%.and those who strongly disagreed made 5%. 
with respect to equipment or aids use for swimming 
(such as swim fins, swimming paws, swimming rafts, 
etc.) during training, 76.9 % answered with yes and 
23.1% said no answer. With regard to adhering to 
proper warm-up sessions before starting swimming, or 
cool-down exercises after the sessions, 50.3% answ- 
ered yes and 49.7% said no. The participants have 
been also asked if they were currently experiencing  any swimming-related injury. 30.8% of them actually 
answered yes and 69.2% answered no. Concerning 
undergoing a surgical procedure related to muscu-
loskeletal injuries  (Roy et al.,  2020) , ligaments, ten-
dons, or cartilage, 11.8% answers were positive and 
88.2% answers were negative. Then they were asked if 
they had received a confirmed diagnosis of a muscu-
loskeletal injuries by a doctor, the majority with 75.1% 
answered negative. Finally, the answer was yes with a 
percentage of 95.3% for a question about if they agree 
on the importance of implementing clear, scientifically 
based training programs to reduce sports injuries. Fig. 
7 show that the injuries occurrence whiles the partici-
pants were either inside or outside the water, of 86 % 
and 14 % percentages, respectively.

dual increase in the exercise load and continuity in 
training when an injury occurred. In addition to the 
invalidity of sportswear, non-adherence to a clear 
training program, absence of the coach ’s guidance, 
bad weather, lack of compliance with security and 
safety rules, allowing the player to return to training 
before full recovery, non-adherence to diet program and lack of knowledge about swimming injuries, cau-
ses and ways to prevent them.  
Question Five: How have swimming injuries 
affected swimming performance and training? 
To address the question and achieve the objective, the 
researcher used frequencies and percentages value for 
each of the variables as shown in Table 5  and Fig. 10 .

Fig. 10:  Injuries effect on swimmer ’s performance. 
 
As presented in Table 5 and Fig. 10 , decreased swim-
ming speed or endurance, reduced training intensity or 
frequency,  impaired stroke technique, limited range of 
motion or flexibility and requiring complete cessation 
of swimming cause the main effects on the swimming 
performance and training, with the following weights 
respectively: 34.9% , 20.8% ,20.3%,10.3%  and 4.3%. Question Sex : if the swimmer adhered to warming 
up before or cooling down after sessions?

According to the results in the current study, the most 
causes of injuries were inadequate warm up. Partici-
pants were asked if they have been adhering to proper 
warming up before and cooling down after sessions, 
the result in table 4.8 shown that participants who 
answer ed yes made 50.3%. These have reported the 
following injuries percentages: (the muscle spasm; 
24.3%), (muscle cramps; 23.7%), (no injuries; 11.8%), 
(sprains; 7.1%) and (ligament or tendon tears; 5.3%). 
Whereas those who answered no made 49.7%, and, 
reported the following injuries: (muscle spasm; 
19.5%), (sprains; 18.9%) (muscle cramps; 17.8%), 
(ligament or tendon tears; 9.5%), and (no injuries ; 
7.7%). According to the se results, we found that the 
despite 50.3% of the participants have been warming 
up, there are still injuries present among them. This 
leads us to question the adequacy and nature of the 
exercises they perform and their duration. 
 
DISCUSSION: 
The study revealed that shoulder injuries were the 
most common musculoskeletal injuries among swim-
mers in Jordan, followed by back, knee, and neck 
injuries. These findings align with the biomechanics of 
swimming, where shoulder involvement is integral to 
propulsion. Rotator cuff impingement and tendinitis 
were prevalent shoulder injuries, consistent with elite 
swimmers. Interestingly, these results diverge from 
some previous studies, underlining the importance of 
recognizing sport-specific injury risks. Question two 
explored participants' engagement in strength training 
and their receipt of injury prevention guidance. The 
majority (68.8%) acknowledged participating in stren-
gth training, emphasizing its perceived importance for 
swimmers. Swimming coaches played a pivotal role in 
providing injury prevention guidance, reinforcing their 
influence in fostering injury prevention awareness. 
Furthermore, the prevalence of swimmers seeking 
medical treatment (68.8%) emphasizes the need for 
enhanced preventive measures. The diverse treatment 
methods used reflect the multifaceted nature of these 
injuries, with physical therapy being prominent for 
musculoskeletal imbalances. Surgical intervention was 
necessary for severe cases. Many swimmers (72.2%) 
adapting their training routines demonstrated a pro-
active approach to injury prevention. The awareness of 
exercises and stretches for injury prevention (63.3%) indicates an informed cohort. The use of equipment 
and aids (76.9%) underlines their role in optimizing 
training and potentially mitigating injuries. However, 
variations in warm-up and cool-down practices sug-
gest the need for enhanced awareness campaigns. Que-
stion three examined common musculoskeletal injuries 
among Jordanian swimmers, revealing muscle spasm, 
muscle cramps, sprains, and other injuries such as 
ligament or tendon tears. This aligns with some liter-
ature, although variations in findings can be attributed 
to sample differences, capacities, interests, injury 
causes, and circumstances. The diverse injury patterns 
emphasize the complexity of injuries among swim-
mers. Question four addressed the causes of sport s 
injuries, with inadequate warm-up emerging as a 
leading cause. Proper preparation through warm-up 
routines readies the body and optimizes joint perfor-
mance. Nevertheless, these results contrast with some 
studies in the literature, highlighting the impact of 
overtraining, especially in swimmers with multiple 
commitments and varied coaching methods. These 
findings underscore the significance of understanding 
sport-specific injury risks. Swimming injuries have 
multifaceted effects on performance, involving physio-
logical and biomechanical changes. They lead to the 
reduced swimming speed or endurance, decreased 
training intensity, compromised stroke technique, 
limited range of motion, and even complete cessation 
of swimming. These effects are attributed to th e 
complex nature of injuries, causing pain and discom-
fort and altering movement patterns and muscle 
tension. Reduced training intensity results in detrain-
ing effects, compromising cardiovascular fitness, mus-
cle strength, and neuromuscular coordination. Addi-
tionally, stroke technique is compromised due to 
compensatory movements, and the joint flexibility is 
reduced. Even a brief hiatus from swimming leads to 
performance decline, with muscle atrophy, weakened 
neural pathways, and diminished cardiovascular fitn-
ess. These multifaceted effects encompass pain-related 
changes, biomechanical alterations, detraining conse-
quences, muscle loss, and neuromuscular adaptations, 
with several factors determining the extent of per-
formance impact. In question five and six, inadequate 
warm-up practices significantly contributed to injuries. 
Approximately 50.3% of participants followed warm-
up protocols, experiencing injuries like muscle spasms

UniversePG I www.universepg.com                                                                                                                                                           28 and cramps. Interestingly, even some of those who 
adhered to warm-up routines experienced injuries, 
prompting questions about the efficacy and nature of 
these exercises. These findings underscore the intricate 
relationship between warm-up practices and injury 
prevention, emphasizing the need for a more nuanced 
and comprehensive approach to exercise prescription 
and injury mitigation. A scientifically informed warm-
up is a pivotal component of any physical activity 
regimen, offering multifaceted physiological and 
neurological benefits, enhancing circulation, impro-
ving muscle elasticity, and reducing injury risks.  
 
CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS:  
The study investigated prevalent the musculoskeletal 
injuries among swimmers in Jordan, revealing that 
muscle spasm (29.8%), muscle cramps (28.6%), and 
sprains (17.7%) were the most common injuries, 
primarily of abrupt nature. These injuries were often 
attributed to factors like insufficient warm-up (34%), 
overtraining (27%), the exercise errors (16%), poor 
technique (14%), and other causes (10%). These inju-
ries had various impacts on swimmers' performance 
and training, such as reduced speed or endurance 
(34.9%) and compromised stroke technique (10.3%). 
Specific body positions were identified as more prone 
to injuries, with the shoulder (35.3%), back (14.4%), 
knee (10.7%), and neck (10.2%) areas being parti-
cularly susceptible. The study underscores the signi-
ficance of injury prevention, proper technique, and 
gradual training in swimming, offering valuable in-
sights for swimmers, coaches, and professionals 
seeking to enhance training practices and prioritize 
swimmers' well-being. The recommendations provided 
encompass various aspects of swimming, including 
training, coaching, and injury prevention. They emp-
hasize the importance of incorporating scientifically 
designed warm-up programs to reduce the risk of 
injuries, the necessity of imparting precise guidance on 
swimming techniques to ensure correct form, the 
inclusion of supplementary dryland training, and the 
significance of refraining from training until a full 
recovery from injury. Education on injury theory is 
deemed crucial for both coaches and swimmers, along 
with the cultivation of a holistic coach-athlete rela-
tionship. Swimmers should also embrace personal 
responsibility, while administrative officials are res-ponsible for providing adequate training facilities. The 
regular maintenance of training equipment is pivotal, 
and the sharing of injury study findings with trainers is 
encouraged to enhance the safety of training programs. 
Collectively, these recommendations serve as a comp-
rehensive framework for injury prevention and the 
overall well-being of swimmers in the field of swim-
ming.
