Abstract  
This twelve months survey compared injury risk and injury 
types by genders (312 females, 262 males) in 15- to 35-year-old 
cross-country skiers, swimmers , long-distance runners and 
soccer players. More male than female athletes reported at least 
one acute injury (44% vs. 35%, p < 0.05), and more male than 
female runners reported at leas t one overuse injury (69% vs. 
51%, p < 0.05). When the incidence of acute and overuse inju-
ries both separately and combined was calculated per 1000 
training hours, per 1000 competition hours and all exposure 
hours combined we found no gender differences in either of 
these comparisons. After adjustment for sport event males were 
at increased risk for posterior thigh overuse injuries compared to 
females (relative risk (RR) 5.8, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3 
to 26.4, p < 0.05) while females were at increased risk for over-
use injuries in the ankle compared to males (RR 3.1, 95% CI 1.0 
to 9.3, p < 0.05). After adju stment for exposure time (inju-
ries/1000 exposure hours) signifi cance of the difference between 
the sexes in overuse injury to the ankle persisted (female 0.11 
vs. male 0.02 injuries/1000 exposure hours, p < 0.05). Six ath-
letes had an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury, of whom 
four were female soccer player s. After combining all reported 
acute and overuse ankle and knee injuries, the proportion of 
athletes with such injury was higher in the female compared to 
male soccer players (75% and 54% respectively; p < 0.05), but 
no difference was found in such in juries when ca lculated per 
1000 exposure hours. In conclusi on, we found some gender 
differences in sport-related injuries, but most of these differ-
ences seemed to be explained at least in part by differences in 
the amount of training.   
 
Key words:  Male, female, athletic injuries, acute injury, over-
use injury. 
 
 
Introduction 
 
In general patterns of injuries in athletes have been as-
sumed to be more sport-specific than gender-specific. 
Presently, most sport injury studies that have investigated 
gender differences have focused exclusively on knee injuries (Arendt and Dick, 1995; Dugan, 2005). To date, 
only a few sport injury studies have compared acute in-
jury rates (Kujala et al., 1995 ) or overall injury rates (de 
Loes et al., 2000; Sallis et al., 2001) between the sexes.  
Previous studies have found similar overall injury 
rates in men and women (Lanese et al., 1990; Sallis et al., 2001). In contrast some sports and recreation-related 
injury studies have shown male  athletes to be at greater 
risk for injury than their female counterparts (Conn et al., 2003; Dempsey et al., 2005). Powell and Barber-Foss 
(2000) and Elias et al. (2001) have reported that female 
soccer players had a higher incidence of injury than 
males .  
Male athletes have been reported to have a higher 
risk for severe sport-related injuries than female athletes 
(Conn et al., 2003). Only a few studies have reported on 
gender differences in injuri es related to cross-country 
skiing (Sandelin et al., 1980) and swimming (McMaster 
and Troup, 1993).  
Specific to body location,  females athletes have 
been reported to have more injuries to  the hip  (Sallis et 
al., 2001; Satterthwaite et al., 1999), lower leg and shoul-
der than male athletes, while males had more injuries in the thigh than females (Sallis et al., 2001). In marathon 
runners Satterthwaite et al. (1 999) noticed that males had 
greater risk for hamstring and calf injuries than female runners. de Loes et al. (2000) reported that overall risk for 
knee injury in 12 sports was significantly higher for fe-
males than males. Similarly Arendt and Dick (1995) found that knee injuries were more prevalent among fe-
male than male soccer players. 
Overall, the literature of gender differences in inju-
ries is limited. It is not known precisely whether the gen-
der differences found are sport-specific only and thus 
related to training behaviors, or whether the difference in 
risk is related to biological gender differences.  
Our purpose was to study differences in sport-
related injuries between male and female elite athletes in 
four sports with different loading patterns. The sports 
were cross-country skiing, swimming, long-distance run-ning and soccer.  
 
Methods 
 
Subjects  
A questionnaire was sent to competitive top-ranking Fin-
nish female and male athletes (age 15 - 35 years) after each competitive season. Ov erall, 1200 questionnaires 
were distributed with the sample represented four differ-
ent sports and loading modalities for 300 cross-country skiers (repetitive loading to upper and lower extremities 
with pliant movements), 268 swimmers (repetitive load-
ing to upper extremities without impact loads), 265 long-distance runners (repetitive loading to lower extremities 
with moderate impact loads) and 367 (21 teams) soccer 
players (higher for imp act loads and sprains) Research article

The long-distance runners whose running distance was from 1500m to marathon were 
included in to the study. Afte r excluding participants over  35 years of age and soccer 
teams with a low response rate, the final study target group consisted of 1075 athletes 
(Ristolainen et al., in press, 2009). The study protocol was approved by the ethics com-
mittee of the University of Jyväskylä. 
 
Questionnaire 
The 12-month structural retrospective sport injury questionnaire included items on an-
thropometry, training history, training and competition volume as well as on acute and 
overuse sport injuries during the past 12-mont h period. In addition, questions were asked 
about the anatomical location of the injury, type of injury and situation in which the 
injury was sustained (in training or competit ion). Female athletes were also asked about 
if the menstruation had begun, and in what age they started, the regularity or irregularity 
of menstrual cycle (oligo- or amenorrhea). The menstrual irregularity was defined as 6 menstruations or less per year or missing menstruation (Bennell and Alleyne, 2007). 
Also the number of menstrual cycles was asked during the past 12 months.  The ques-
tionnaire has been previously validated agai nst interview data (Eloranta and Tittonen, 
2006; Karhula and Pakkanen, 2005). 
The term acute injury was defined as an injury that occurs suddenly or acciden-
tally, interrupting the athlete´s training or performing in a competition or causing an 
identifiable trauma. An acute injury was any ph ysical injury which kept the athlete away from at least one training session, or competition, or needed a physician’s care.  The 
term overuse injury was defined as an injury  that causes pain during exercise loading 
without any noticeable ex ternal cause of injury. The inju ry gradually caused worsening 
pain during or after exercise.  The pain got worse when the loading was continued and 
might cause the exercise to be stopped completely.  
 
Statistics 
The statistical analyses were done with the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences, 
version 15.0 (Norusis/SPSS, In c., Chicago, Illinois). We calculated the results as abso-
lute injury rates, comparing between the sexe s. We then calculated injury rates as num-
ber of injuries per 1000 exposure hours i.e. hours spent on any type of training or on 
performing in competitions separately and combined. Injury rates were calculated sepa-
rately for acute, overuse and all injuries. χ
2 statistics, t tests and analysis of variance 
(ANOVA) were applied to calculate statisti cal differences in gender distributions and 
between sports. Poisson regression was used to calculate the injury risk, adjusted for 
sport event, between the sexes.  
 
Results 
 
Six hundred and thirty-nine out of 1200 (53%) returned a questionnaire, from which 574 
(312  female  and  262  male)  agreed  to  participate  to  this  study.  Final   participation

response rate was 48%.  To investigate the reasons for not responding we sent one-page questionnaire to long-distance runners (99 athletes) who did not respond to our long 
questionnaire. The most common reported reason for non-response was the length of the 
questionnaire. Females reported less training  (566 hours/year [h/yr]) during the past 
twelve months than males (636 h/yr, p < 0.05). The athletes reported on average 16.2 
competition hours per year (female: 14.8 and ma le: 17.9, p = 0.08) for the whole sample.  
The average number of competition hours vari ed by sport because of different duration 
of competitions i.e. in swimmers vs. soccer players. Detailed sex-specific, anthropomet-
ric and training and competition information are shown in Table 1. 
 
Acute injuries 
Two hundred and twenty-five at hletes (39%) reported 432 acute injuries. More male 
than female athletes reported an acute inju ry (44% vs. 35%, p < 0.05); this was espe-
cially seen in soccer players (84% vs. 64%, p = 0.01).  However, af ter the acute injuries 
were calculated per 1000 exposure hours (training and competition hours combined), no gender differences were found (Table 2). Moreover, no gender difference was found in 
any specific sports in acute injuries sustai ned in a competition when calculated per 1000 
competition hours.  
There were only a few significant gender di fferences in what body locations acute  injuries occurred. A higher proportion of female  athletes than male athletes had an acute 
injury at the heel (p < 0.05). More male than  female athletes had an  acute injury in the 
upper back (p < 0.05). After adjustment for sport event these differ ences were no longer 
statistically significant. The locations of acute injuries by genders are shown in more detail in Figure 1.  
A higher proportion of men than women reported an acute muscle injury (44% vs. 
31%, p < 0.05). After adjustment for spor t event the difference was no longer statisti-
cally significant. A higher proportion of female (46%) than male athletes (33%) reported 
an acute ligament injury (p < 0.05) (Figure 2) ; this was seen especially in soccer players 
(71% vs. 42%, p < 0.01).  
 
Overuse injuries 
Four hundred and thirty-three overuse injuri es were sustained by 292 athletes (51%). 
Overuse injuries were more prevalent among male than female runners (69% vs. 51%, p 
< 0.05), but there was no statistical signifi cant difference found when the overuse inju-
ries were calculated per 1000 exposure hours (Table 2).   
The specific anatomical locations of overuse injuries by gender are shown in Fig-
ure 3. A higher proportion of men than women reported an injury in the posterior thigh (p < 0.01). This  was  especially  seen  in  soccer players (p < 0.05).  After  adjustment for

women reported toe (p < 0.05) and upper back (p < 0.05) 
injuries. A higher proportion of female than male athletes reported ankle (p < 0.05) injuries (Figure 3). After ad-justment for sport event the ri sk for overuse ankle injury 
was greater in females than males (RR 3.1, 95% CI 1.0-
9.3, p < 0.05). The ankle injury rate per 1000 exposure 
hours was also greater in fema le than male athletes (0.11 
vs. 0.02, p < 0.05). A higher proportion of female than 
male cross-country skiers reported an overuse injury at

There was found no gender differences in the proportion 
of overuse injuries by tissue type (Figure 4).  
All injuries  
A significantly higher proportion of male (92%) than 
female soccer players (79%, p < 0.05) reported at least 
one injury during the past twelve months. The same trend 
was found in long-distance runners, among whom 68% of female and 82% of male runners reported injury (p = 0.06 between the sexes).   
When combining acute and overuse injuries of the 
ankle and the knee among all athletes, no difference was 
observed in the proportion of injured athletes between females (49%) and males (41%) (p = 0.13). After repeat-
ing the same analysis within sports between the sexes, the 
only significant difference wa s seen among soccer play-
ers. The proportion of female players with such an injury 
was higher than the proportion of male players (75% and 
54% respectively; p < 0.05). In our study an anterior cru-ciate ligament (ACL) injury was identified in six cases,

four of which were women. Five of these ACL injuries 
occurred in soccer players and one female player had been injured twice.  
 
Menstrual irregularities and injuries 
Menstrual irregularities were reported by 40 (13%) 
women and were more common among long-distance 
runners (26%) than soccer pl ayers (6%, p = 0.002) or 
swimmers (6%, p = 0.001). Cross-country skiers (16%) 
reported menstrual irregularities more often than swim-mers (6%, p = 0.05) and the same trend was seen also in 
soccer players (6%, p = 0.07 ). The only difference be-
tween athletes with regular and those with irregular men-ses was found in overuse injury among cross-country 
skiers (46% vs. 85%, p = 0.01).   
 
Discussion 
 
The primary goal of our study was to investigate gender 
differences in sport-related injuries during the previous 
twelve months in four sports with different loading pat-
terns. More male than female athletes had at least one acute injury. Also more male than female long-distance 
runners had at least one overuse injury. However, when 
we calculated the incidence of acute or overuse injuries as 
the number of injuries per 1000 exposure hours, we found 
no gender differences. A few gender differences were 
observed in the anatomical location of injuries. The main difference was a greater number of overuse injuries in the 
posterior thigh in male than female athletes, whereas 
females had a greater risk for overuse injuries to the an-
kle. The risk for such injuries remained after adjustment 
for sport event. A higher proportion of female soccer 
players had more combined acute and overuse injuries in the ankle and knee than male players.  
More acute injuries per year have been reported 
among male than female athl etes (Kujala et al., 1995; 
Sandelin et al., 1980).  Powell and Barber-Foss (2000) 
reported more acute injuries in girl than boy soccer play-ers and Elias (2001) showed slightly greater aggregate 
injuries in female than male  soccer players. In addition, 
increased injury risk in female than male for swimmers (Sallis et al., 2001) and high -school cross-country runners 
(Rauh et al., 2000) has been reported. Overall, in accor-
dance with our findings, Lanese et al. (1990) found no differences in overall injury in cidence in different sports 
after adjustment for exposure time. However, Rauh et al. 
(2006) found gender differences after adjusting exposure time. It seems that possible gender differences in the 
injury rate may be partly due to or explained by differ-
ences in exposure time.  
In a review, van Gent et al. (2007) reported that in-
jury rates in the lower extremities were common in both 
female and male runners. The same finding was reported for cross-country skiers (Sandelin et al., 1980; Orava et 
al., 1985), which is in line with our results. An equal 
number of overuse injuries of the lower limbs was also found between males and females in sports other than 
swimming. In contrast to Sallis et al. (2001) and Satter-
thwaite et al. (1999) we found no gender difference be-
tween different groups of sport in injuries in the calf or hip. Sallis et al. (2001) studied injuries among athletes at 
the intercollegiate level and Satterthwaite et al. (1999) studied injuries and other health problems during a mara-
thon race. Differences in st udy design, such as definition 
of the injury or different data collection methods, may explain these conflicting results.   
Hamstring strains are common injuries in sports 
characterized by maximal sp rinting, kicking and sudden 
acceleration (Lysholm and Wiklan der, 1987). Waldén et 
al. (2005) reported that acute  thigh injury in soccer play-
ers was the most common injury, causing a great amount 
of training and competition time loss. There is evidence 
showing that previous hamstring strains and age (Arnason et al., 2004) are independent risk factors for new ham-
string strains. Thigh injuries may partly be explained by 
muscle fatigue, high training intensities, insufficient warm-up and hamstring tightness (Kujala et al., 1997), 
but the evidence for this is less convincing (Arnason et 
al., 2004; Bahr and Holme, 2003). In some cases the 
number of players per soccer team may be low and there-
fore the high amount of playing time per player may in-
crease the risk for thigh inju ries, and also the risk for 
overall injuries. In our study there was no difference be-
tween the sexes in acute thigh injuries. However, a higher 
proportion of our male than female athletes had overuse injuries in the posterior thigh, which is in line with the 
findings of earlier studies (Satterthwaite et al., 1999; 
Sallis et al., 2001) and clinical experience. Hosea et al. 
(2000) found in basketball players that females had 
greater overall risk for ankle injury than males. In our study females had a three-fold greater risk than males for 
overuse injury in the ankle. Higher joint laxity in females 
may contribute to this finding (Rozzi et al., 1999; Quat-man et al., 2008). 
Similar to the study by McMaster and Troup 
(1993) on elite swimmers, in our swimmers overuse inju-ries occurred mostly in the shoulder region and no gender 
differences were found. Upper back injuries were rare in 
our female swimmers. Sallis et al. (2001) reported more injuries in college female than male swimmers in the 
shoulder and back/neck region. They suggested that a 
possible explanation for this difference may be training intensity. However, we did not investigate the training 
intensity, but there was no gender difference in the 
amount of training during the past twelve months.  
Female compared to male basketball or soccer 
players have shown increased  risk for traumatic ankle 
injury (Hosea et al., 2000; Elias, 2001). Among our soc-
cer players females had slightly  more acute ankle injuries 
than males. Moreover, women had more overuse injuries in the ankle and in the wrist than men. While especially 
ankle injuries are common in both genders, effective 
methods of preventing sports injuries, such as use of in-soles, external joint supports and multi-intervention train-
ing programs, have been proposed to prevent injuries 
(Aaltonen et al., 2007). 
Women have been reported to have more knee in-
juries than men, especially ACL injuries (Arendt and 
Dick, 1995; de Loes et al., 2000; Dugan, 2005). Female soccer players at the time of in jury have been found to be 
younger than male players (Bjo rdal et al., 1997). During 
Ristolainen et al.
 
 
 449
the present one-year follow- up time only one male soccer 
player suffered from an ACL injury, but no age difference 
was found between the female soccer players who had ACL injury (22.3 yr) and those who did not (21.0 yr, p = 
0.53).  Overall, we found similar numbers of knee injuries 
between men and women in all four sports. Haapasalo et al. (2007) also found no gender differences in overall 
knee injury risk, except in endurance sports. When acute 
and overuse injuries in the ankle and knee were com-bined, female soccer players ha d more such injuries than 
male players, as has been found in earlier studies both for 
the ankle (Hosea et al., 2000; Elias, 2001) and for the knee (Arendt and Dick, 1995; de Loes et al., 2000; 
Dugan, 2005) separately. Such  injuries may also cause 
long absence time from training and competition. How-ever, in our study there was no difference between the 
sexes in time-loss from acute or overuse injury (data not 
shown). Injury severity is described in more details in our 
previous article  (Ristolainen et al., in press, 2009).  
Female sex has been found to be a risk factor for 
stress fractures in the military population (Mattila et al., 
2007), but less so in athlet es (Snyder et al., 2006). Iwa-
moto and Takeda (2003) concluded in their review that male athletes tend to have more stress fractures than 
women. The findings are inconsistent as Bennell et al. 
(1996a, 1996b) found an association between menstrual disturbances and stress fractures among runners, but San-
delin et al. (1980) found no association when studying 
cross-country skiers. There was 9.0% of stress fractures in female and 8.8% in male athletes. Nearly 50 % of fe-
male’s stress fractures occurred to those female athletes 
with menstrual irregularities. So, the statistically non-significant association between menstrual irregularities 
and stress fractures may be due to low statistical power 
(type two error). 
Approximately one out of every fourth female ath-
letes report having a menstrual irregularity (Nichols et al., 
2006; Torstveit and Sundgot-Borgen, 2005), and these 
have been more common in long-distance runners, ballet 
dancers and gymnasts than in swimmers (Nichols et al., 
2006, Torstveit and Sundgot-Borgen, 2005). Our long-
distance runners also had significantly more menstrual 
irregularities than soccer players and swimmers. How-ever, we did not find any association between stress frac-
tures and menstrual irregular ities. After adjustment for 
exposure hours we found no association between men-strual irregularities and in the number of injuries.  
In our study the average competition time between 
sports was fairly different (in particular between swim-ming and soccer playing). However, there were no differ-
ence between the sexes in the acu te injury occurred in the 
competition within all athletes or within different sport.  
We studied gender differences in four different 
sports, and the injury risk was counted per 1000 exposure 
hours. It should be noted that these sports types differed from each other in loading characteristics and that there 
was only one contact sport. This can be considered both a 
strength and a limitation in our study, as our results indi-cate that gender differences are independent of type of 
sport. However, the low number of injuries limited some 
sport-specific injury comparations. We sent the question-
naire to the participants immediately after the competition season, and in each sport the response rate was similar. 
The limitations of this study include the use of self-
reported questionnaire. However, the questionnaire data were validated and reliability-tested against the interview 
data, and were shown to be accurate (Eloranta and Titto-
nen, 2006; Karhula and Pakkanen, 2005). Retrospective data collection is a limitation in our study. Also, the vali-
dation method we used does not exactly reveal the accu-
racy and coverage of the reported injuries, but was more adequate for measuring the reproducibility/repeatability 
of the data collection. Co mparability between different 
sports should not be a problem in our study as the method applied was the same for all four sports studied. In addi-
tion, the athletes in each sport were on the top-ranking list 
in their sports, and for this reason were to some extent comparable despite their different sport events.  
 
Conclusion 
 
The overall gender-related risk for acute and overuse 
injuries in top-level athletes between the sexes was small. However, we found some gender differences in the spe-
cific anatomical locations of injuries as well as in specific 
injuries in sports. Some of these differences seem to be 
explained by the differences in the amount of training.

Key points 
 
• Only a few sport injury studies have compared in-
jury rates between the sexes 
• Overall gender-related risk for acute and overuse 
injuries in top-level athletes between the sexes was 
small 
• Some gender differences in  the specific anatomical 
locations of injuries as well as in specific injuries in 
sports were found  
• Some of these differences seem to be explained by 
the differences in the amount of training
