 Shoulder injury in water polo: a systematic review of incidence and  intrinsic risk factors.  
Abstrac t 
Background: Water polo is a popular water -based contact sport that involves swimming, throwing and 
defending. Cumulatively, these repetitive overhead activities are thought to increase the risk of 
shoulder injury and, subsequently to affect players’ physical conditio ning as well as team 
performance. 
Objective: To examine available  evidence relating to shoulder injury rates and risk factors for shoulder 
injury in water polo . 
Methods:  CINAHL, AUSPORT , Pubmed, Pedro and SPORTDiscus databases were searched  for 
original research papers  using the predefined terms ( "water polo") AND (shoulder OR glenohumeral* 
OR a rm OR "upper limb"). 
Results: Twenty  papers were identified as suitable for inclusion. Reported shoulder inj ury rates varied 
from 24%-51%. Shoulder injuries were more likely to become chronic compared to all  other reported 
injuries . Injury data during the last three World Championships indicate s an increasing rate of 
shoulder injur ies-per- year with participation in aquatic sport s. Risk for shoulder injury in water  polo is 
multi -factorial. Volume of shooting, range of motion, scapular dyskinesis, strength i mbalance, 
proprioceptive deficit and altered throwing kinematics have been proposed to be associated with an 
increased risk of injury  
Conclusion:  Although th is review showed water polo to have a high propensity for shoulder i njury , the 
descriptive nature of the included papers limit ed the inferences that could be drawn from  the pooled 
literature. Future direction s for research include collecting normative data f or shoulder range of 
motion, strength ratio and proprioception with prospective analysis of these attributes in relation to  
injury rates and time los t.

 i. Introduction  
Water polo originated in the mid -19th century in England and Scotland as an aquatic form of rugby.1 
Men’s water polo was introduced at the modern Olympics in 1900 making the sport of wa ter polo the 
first Olympic team competition .2 Presently, t he International Swimming Federation (FI NA) is the  
international governing body for the sport.3 
Water polo is a physically demanding sport, particularly on athletes’ upper limbs , with  intense bursts 
of sprint swimming, changing direction every 6.2s4, and passing and shooting the ball repetitively 
from end-of- range  shoulder abduction (Abd ) and external rotation (ER) a t arm speeds of up to 
24.1±1.58 ms-1.5 
Risk factors identified for shoulder pain in swimmers are often  extrapolated  to water polo , despite the 
unique demands. Unlike competitive  swimm ers, water polo players use an adapted upright swimming 
posture to allow transport of the ball and a clear view of the opposition. The elevated posture 
eliminates the body rol l observed in traditional freestyle swimming , increasing the required shoulder 
Abd and internal rotation (IR) and placing  stress on the rotator cuff .6 Also in contrast to swimming, 
water polo is a contact sport. In defensive play, athletes keep their arms above t heir head to physically 
obstruct the opposition and block opposing players’ throws, placing external  force on the shoulder 
joint.7, 8  
The aquatic environment means that water polo players  generate throwing force wit hout the 
contribution of a solid  base of support , making it difficult  to produce the conventional throwing 
proximal- distal kinematic chain sequence .6, 9 When throwing  in water polo, power is produced by the 
trunk rotating  forward from  hyperextension to 20°  flexion to maximise shoulder ER by leaving th e 
arm and ball behind the body (Figure 1).9 The arm then moves  in an arc , shifting the body towards the 
horizontal plane as the trunk simultaneously laterally flexes away from the throwing  arm, increasing 
the height and velocity for ball release .9, 10

Despite the lower average ball velocity observed in water polo (16 .5ms-1) compared to baseball (33 ms-
1) and American football (23ms-1), res ultant joint torques is  similar .11 Horizontal adduction and IR 
torque in the penalty shot is 64/59Nm compared to 100/67Nm and 78/66Nm for baseball and 
American football respectively .10, 12, 13 The observed force  can be explained by the large r size and 
weight of the water polo ball (400-450g) compared  to baseball , and the reduced contribution of the 
lowe r extremity to the kinetic chain .10, 14, 15  
The aim of this paper was to review the available literature regarding shou lder injury rates and risk 
factors for shoulde r injury in water polo. It has been previously suggested that shoulder injury r ates are 
as high as 80% in elite water polo,1, 6, 16 however due to limited research results are often extrapola ted 
from other overhead sports. Evaluation of the incidence of shoulder injury and the relationship 
between intrinsic risk factors and shoulder injury may help identify  “at risk” athletes and enable 
targeted injury prevention strategies. Further, this revi ew serves to identify current gaps in water polo 
research regarding shoulder injury rates, normative data and risk factors associ ated with shoulder 
injury .

 ii. Methods  
CINAHL, AUSPORT,  Pubmed, Pedro and SPORTDiscus databases were searched using the key 
terms ("water polo") AND (shoulder OR glenohumeral* OR a rm OR "upper limb"). No date limits 
were applied and the search was completed in August 2016.  Two reviewers conducted the selection 
process and independently evaluated the characteristics and key outc omes of the study.  Studies were 
included if they were in English and original research , and could be anthropometrical, descriptive, 
epidemiological or interventional . No restriction was placed on player’s age or competition level.  
Studies were excluded if multiple overhead sports wer e aggregated in the analysis or  if non-
conservative/surgical interventions were applied.  The sequence of paper selection is presented  in 
Figure 2 . 
Articles were di vided by the main themes of injury inci dence, pain, st rength, ROM, proprioception, 
pathoanatomy and posture. The quality of the final study yield  was analysed  using a modified version 
of the Critical Review Form for Quantitative Studies.17 To enable a numerical result each criterion was 
evaluated using a dichotomous ‘yes’ =1, no or not applicable = 0 for a total achievable score of 12, 
with a score of greater than 50% required for inclusion. Final study ratings were collated and inter-
rater difference discussed in a consensus meeting. The quality score  and outcome summary is reported 
in Table 1.

 iii. Results  
The review process returned 20 papers . Six papers considered epidemiology of shoulder pain and 
injury and the remaining 14 investigated intrinsic risk factors of  shoulder injury in water polo players.  
Injury incidence was defined as  the number of new inju ries in a specified time period,18 and injury rate 
as the number of injuries divided by athlete- time-exposure .19 
Shoulder injury i ncidence  at major championships . Three  studies evaluated shoulder injury  
incidence at ma jor international cha mpionships.7, 8, 20 A cohort study of male water polo players 
competing at the 2004 Summer Olympics reported that 53% of i njuries affected the head/ neck, 12% 
the trunk and 6% the shoulder .7 Retrospective analysis of the 2009 FINA World Championshi ps 
revealed  that upper-limb injury was highest in water polo compared to other aquatic sports, w ith 37% 
of the total injuries (n=48) being reported by water polo athletes, of which  19% affected  the head/ neck 
region and 12.5% affected the shoulder.20 Analysis of injury incidence prior to and during the 2013 
FINA World Championships demonstra ted that water polo had the highest injury rate compared to all 
other aq uatic sports (15.3 injuries/ 100-athletes) followed by open water sw imming (11.7) and diving 
(11.4).8 Of injuries to the head and neck across all sports, water polo was responsible fo r two -thirds of 
the total number of injuries (n=23).  The most frequently -injured body part at the World 
Championships was the shoulder (n=39, 21%) and 25% of injuries that resulted in time loss were 
shoulder injuries (n=28); although the percentages  for each sport were not reported. A more recent 
review of the last three FINA World C hampionships, confirms the shoulder was the most commonly 
affected anato mical site for aquatic athletes .21  
Shoulder injury incidence. The other t hree epidemiological studies obtained documented anatomical 
site and injury incidence in water polo players and all found shoulder injury the most prevalent .22-24 
Ellapen et al .24 prospectively examined the prevalence of musculoskeletal pain in adolescent male 
water polo players. During the 12-month study pe riod, the shoulder accounted for over half (51%) of 
all injuries sustained. A 13 -year retrospective study was conducted on male water polo scholarship 
holders at the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS). Of all anatomical sites, the shoulder had the highest 
reported clinical incidence (n=67), comprising 24% of tot al injury over the 13- year period , and 
7 | Page  
 shoulder injuries were also more likely to become chronic .22 Sallis et al .23 was the only author to 
consider gender differen ces and injury incidence, with injuries at a single NCAA -Division -III college 
compared  over a 15 -year period. A statistically significant gender difference (p<0.01) w as found for 
shoulder injury , with female water polo players reporting 2.38 times the rate (3.40 vs 8.09/100 
participant years)  of shoulder injury compared with men.  
Shoulder pain and patho -anatomy. Three  studies considered shoulder pain.14, 15,  25 Wheeler et al .15 
found 74% of shoulde r soreness c ould be explained by the total volume of shooting and reduced rest 
between shots. All athletes reported moderate soreness  (2.9±1.3) on an increasing 10- point likert  scale,  
and shoulder soreness was associated  with performing a greater number of shots. Shoulder soreness 
was shown to increase with an average rest time of <508s between shots in the squad selection camp 
and < 160s in the team game -based camp.  Giombini et al.25 compared  magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI), clinical tests and arthroscopic investigation  in 11 water polo players with shoulder pain and 
demonstrated posterior-superior glenoid rim impingement to be a contribut ing cause of pain in elite-
level water polo players .25 All the players  demonstrated internal impingement, thought to be from 
repetitive positioning of the shoulder in maximum ER /Abd in the cocking phase of throwing. Klein et 
al.14 conducted a cross -sectional study , comparing 28 semi-professional water polo players to healthy 
age-matched controls, but found no significant  correlation between clinical presentation a nd imaging 
results.14 When viewed on MRI, water polo players had significantl y more changes in subscapularis  
(p=0.001) and infraspinatus tendons (p=0.024 ) and the posterior labrum  (p=0.041) than age -matched 
controls. A ll 28 players ’ throwing shoulders demonstrated abnormal findings o n MRI , despite only 
29% being symptomatic.14 
Posture  and shoulder injury.  Water polo athletes with  reduced pectoralis -minor length demonstrated 
altered scapular kinematics ; that is, less posterior scapular tilting and greater IR with humeral 
elevation .26, 27 Scapular  muscle i mbalance from reduced pectoralis-minor length may lead t o 
dyskinesis , increasing gleno humeral contact and impingement of the rotator cuff .28 In players with 
shoulder pain, upward scapular rotation has been shown to decrease after intens e practice, potentially 
increasing the risk of impingement of the rotator cuff.27, 29 Two studies considered the role of posture 
8 | Page  
 profile and injury rates and both demonstrated a positive relationship betwee n a kyphotic posture and 
shoulder pain  in water polo .24, 30 25% of included players reported a previous shoulder injury (elbow -
11%, back-6%) and 8% reported recent shoulder injury ; 67% of players with recent shoulder injury 
had a protracted shoulder posture.30 
Shoulder ROM. In college water polo players’ significantly greater ER  ROM (83.8±10.9° v 
77.5±18.2° p<0.001 ) and total ROM (132.1±17.4° v 127.4±18.2° p=0.04) has been reported for the 
throwing vs non-dominant arm.31 Witwer and Sauers31 attribute this adap tation to elongation of th e 
inferior glenohumeral ligament arising from the repetitive ER and preservation of IR with swimming 
demands. In contrast, results from Elliot32 demonstrated elite water polo player s to have significantly 
greater bilateral shoulder flexion ROM (p<0.01) compared to controls, and reduced unilateral IR of 
their throwing arm (p<0.01). No significant correlation was found between shoulder range and pain.  
Shoulder strength. Although w ater polo players are stronger than age and gender -matched controls, 
rotator cuff muscle imbalance may be present due to greater IR than ER development occurring in 
water polo players.33-36 Of the four studies reviewed, only one reported the expected  ratio for a 
throwing population for IR:ER of 1.0:0.6736 with the other three varying between 1.0:0.50 –1.0:0.6033-
35 indicating an increased IR strength and/or relative decrease in ER  strength .  
Throwing and  shoulder i njury. While shooting a penalty goal, kinematic differences at the elbow 
were observed  in players with shoulder pain, with injured athletes demonstrating lower pe ak angular 
velocity and less elbow flexion early in the throw cycle .37 A more  recent investigation  suggests that 
male water polo players ’ throwing velocity has imp roved over time from 19.7±0.4ms-1 to 
24.1±1.58ms-1.5 However, d espite th is improvement in throwing velocity, no change in kinematic 
variables was observed between athletes with and without shoulder pain . Further investigation of this 
performance phenomenon including specific weight training and talent selecti on is recommended .5 
Proprioception  and strength. Mota and  Ribeiro .36 evaluated the relationship between shoulder 
proprioception and strength  of the shoulder rotators . Greater sensory acuity through improved 
proprioception is suggested  to contribute to enhanced motor contro l of the joint .38 Knowledge of 
9 | Page  
 proprioception, and its association with strength, may improve training and inj ury prevention 
strategies .36 Proprioception acuity at 30°ER was negatively  correlated with both eccentric -ER and 
concentric -IR peak torque in this position . The se main  findings suggest  that the tested cohort of 
athletes may be more prone to injury . Reduced proprioception acuity may lead to a delayed 
neuromuscu lar protective reflex  and the resultant shoulder rotator muscle contraction may  be 
insufficient to protect the j oint from excessive movement.36

 iv. Discussion  
Previous descriptive reports  have suggested  shoulder injury rates in elite w ater polo  are as high as 
80%.1, 6, 16 In contrast, the present review found injury rates for elite male water polo players was 24 % 
and up to 51% for college level males .22, 24 Due to methodolog ical limitations of retr ospective studies , 
such as incomplete medical records and failure to report injury re-occurance , future prospective 
studies with a clear definition  of ‘injury ’ as well as  capturing time-loss to sport participation and 
recording injury rec urrence  are necessary.  
A trend toward  increasing rates of shoulder injury during major international cham pionships was 
observed , with shoulder injury rates doubling between the 2004 Summer Olympics and 2009 FINA 
World Championships from 6% to 13%.7, 20 A contributing factor may have been the rule change in 
2005, whereby the maximum perio d for keeping the b all was reduced from 35s to 30s.39 While t his 
change increased the speed and the appeal of the game, the  rise in throwing frequency may explain the 
increased number of shoulder injuries . Interpretation of the incidence of injury during the 2009 
championships is limited somewhat  by the low response rates from  team physicians (53%).20 Given 
the high rates of shoulder injury  in water polo , risk of chronicity and potential ensuing detraining 
effects on overall performance, research focussing on reducing shoulder injur y frequency in this 
population is warranted . A need exists for implementation of injury prevention strategies at an 
organisat ional level  targeting the shoulder , such as  introducing daily monitoring of athletes’ pain and 
conducting regular evidence- based musculoskeletal screening to enable targeted and early intervention 
for at -risk athletes.40  
It remains unclear whether shoulder injury risk is gender or sport -specific. Only one study investigated 
gender differences in water polo injury rates23 with nearly 2000 injuries recorded during a 15- year 
period. All injuries were evaluated using a standardised injury form completed by the same athletic 
trainer. Female  water polo players were nearly three times more likely to sustain a shoul der injury than 
their male counterpar ts. Although a statistically significant difference was found between genders, n o 
injury severity or time -loss data was recorded, limiting the cl inical significance of the findings.  
Authors suggested the increased injury rate may be attributed to a more rig orous training program for 
11 | Page  
 the female players.23 Gender related differences have been previously demonstrated in anterior 
cruciate ligament injury rates ,41 and one may question whether greater shoulder laxity and less relative 
strength may be similarly contributing to increased shoulder injury in female water polo players. With 
increasing partic ipation of women in water polo, f urther investigation is required to determine if 
shoulder injury is related to the demands of the sport or if gender- specific risk factors exist  that c ould 
be addressed . 
The repetitive stress placed on the athlete's shoulder joint complex duri ng the throwing motion 
challenges the physiologic al limits of the surrounding tissues . Increased s hot frequency was associated 
with shoulder soreness , and thresholds were specific to individual athletes , with 29% of soreness 
prediction based on individual difference s.15 These findings highlight the importance of coaches 
developin g individual athlete thresholds  to enhance performance and reduce injury risk through 
optimising training load and substituti on of athletes during a game . 
In terms of the mechanic s of the water polo throwing action, t wo contradictory views exist regarding 
humeral translation occurring during the cock ing phase. One view suggests that the humeral head 
translates postero -superiorly and is associated with thickening of the posterior cap sule and 
deve lopment of internal impingement42 while the other suggests that repeated Abd and ER is 
associated with anterior -inferior translation and re sultant anterior instability and attenuati on of the 
capsule.43 Giombini et al .25 concluded that a primary cause of pain in water polo players was posterior -
superior glenoid impingement however no asymptom atic water polo players or healthy controls were 
included for comparison. In contrast, Klein et al .14 when comparing water polo players to healthy age-
matched controls , found no correlation between clinical presentation and imaging results . Both authors 
agree the action of overhead throwing causes  anatomical change s to the posterior labrum. The notion 
of the labrum as a primary pain source , however, requires further investigation before a link between 
shoulder pain, throwing and labral pathology in water polo can be confirmed . Anatomical changes of  
the labrum on MRI may not indicate pathology and should not be used as the basis for  intervention in 
a throwing population.44 Rather it is recommended that team physiotherapists consider an athlete ’s 
12 | Page  
 clinical history , clinical examination findings , functional limitation s and radiological  results together 
when developing a management  strategy .14, 45, 46  
One proposed mechanism for altered  scapular kinematics is change in pectoralis -minor length.47 Water 
polo athletes with reduced pectoralis -minor length demonstrate altered scapular kinematics which may 
lead to dyskinesis, increasing gleno humeral contact and risk of rotator cuff impingement.27, 29 It has 
previously been demonstrated that a forward scapular position can result f rom posterior shoulder 
tightness and alteration in shoulder and scapular muscle activity pattern.46 Clinically , the presence of 
scapular asymmetry  in a throwing athlete is nearly universal, however pain is not.46 Given that visual 
assessment of scapular dyskinesis has demonstrated validity for athletes engaged i n overhead sport26, 48 
inclusion of the assessment of scapular dyskinesis in water polo at hlete s’ musculoskeletal screening 
has merit and may enable targeted  stretching for athletes at increased risk of developing shoulder pain. 
However , testing needs to consider the  larger clinical picture including posterior shoulder muscle 
length , muscle strength and activity pattern . 
College level water polo players demonstrated greater E R ROM in their dominant compared to non-
dominant shoulder , attributed to acquired  changes from  repetitive overhead activity.31 As goniometry 
was used to measure ROM instead of ultrasound  it is not possible to determine whether osseous or soft 
tissue adaptation s account for the observed changes in ROM . Previous research in baseball indicates 
that throwing between the ages of 11-16 years  is critical in the deve lopment of humeral retroversion49, 
but the required loads for the development of torsional change is unknown.46 Given the later age that 
water polo player s commence  training, it is proposed that the osseous adap tation of the humerus 
observ ed in baseball would not have as many years to develop.31 Further, t he stresses placed on the 
shoulder joint in water polo are different and require a combination of swimming and to a lesser extent 
overhead throwing. The difficulty lies in differentiating between advantageous adaptive and 
pathological change in ROM. Internal impingement is thought to be a normal phenomenon a nd the 
true pathological process is whe n loss of IR exceeds gain s in ER.42 Baseball players (unilateral) and 
swimmers (bilateral) demonstrate a relative increase in ER and a corresponding loss in IR.50, 51 In elite 
level water polo players , Elliot.32 found a similar imbalance in shoulder flexibility; a bilateral increa se 
13 | Page  
 in ER and unilateral decrease in IR (throwing arm) . In contrast , college level water polo players’ 
throwing arm IR ROM  was preserved , and an increase in ER without a loss of IR is observed.31 It is 
unclear at what point these observed changes in ROM are a predisposing fa ctor to shoulder injury in 
water polo, as only pain -free college level athletes were included31 and no significant correlation was 
found between ROM and pain in the elite population.32 Accordingly, investigation of water polo 
players with and without shoulder pain to establish normative ranges and injury risk is required . 
The overhead throw is the most eff ective method for accelerating the ball and is critical to success and 
scoring goals in water polo . Although elements of shooting efficiency are a trained skill, the 
assumption is that the faster the ball travels, the harder it is for  the goalie to deflect  the shot.52 Water 
polo players demonstrated increased strength in IR and ER compared to gender ma tched controls, 
however a rotator cuff muscle imbalance exists due to greater relative IR than E R strength .33-36 It has 
been proposed that the risk of shoulder  injury is therefore increased  due to insufficient ER strength to 
balance and decelerate the shoulder in the follow through phase of throwing.33-35 Isokinetic shoulder 
strength was measured as it is considered an important parameter to predict t hrowing performance, 
however no change in throwing velocity was observed following a shoulder stre ngthening program 
despite significant increase in strength.35 Participants may have traded off velocity for accuracy though 
due to a target being used to measure throwing performance. Further inv estigation is required to 
clarify the relationship between throwin g speed and shoulder strength. A systematic review of 
shoulder rotation strength in baseball players recommends IR:ER of grea ter than 1.0:0.67.46 Normative 
pre-season strength data of baseball players has shown a correlation between increased I R and reduced 
relative ER strength as a predictor of  in-season shoulder inju ry risk.53 This data provides an evidence -
based foundation for the assessment of water polo players, however  due to the known d ifference in 
throwing mechanics , a need exists for standardised normative data within water polo in order to guide 
strength and conditioning and rehabilitation protocols. 
Kinematic differences at the elbow w hile shooting a penalty goal have been demonstrated in elite 
players with and without shoulder pain, h owever, it is unclear whether this different kinemati c profile 
contributes to development of shoulder injury due to some individuals within the injured  and non-
14 | Page  
 injured group performing  similarly .37 The study groups were also not homogenous at baseline as non-
injured athletes  had lower mean body weight and height.35 One of the major limitations of kinematic 
investigation s of the shoulder in water polo is demonstrating the contribution of the  superficial an d 
deep shoulder cuff muscles to movemen t and stability .5, 37 Superior throwing performance has been 
shown to be characterised by decreased movement variability at critical point s within the penalty 
shot.54 Although shooting proficiency is adversely affected by increased exertion,  height out of the 
water, elbow angle and position at release, ball speed and accuracy were all maintained under 
fatigue.55 Reduction in movement variability at the elbow before ball release suggests that a threshold 
may exist to improve throwing accuracy and potentially reduce injury risk.  The role of technique in 
injury -risk and conversely injury causing change in throwing technique is unclear a nd requires further 
investigation. Water polo is an intermittent and high intensity sport and incr emental fatigue causes 
decrement in throwing performance. To improve athletes throwing proficiency , the literature 
demonstrates value in coaches focussing on i ncreasing  athletes overall fitness55 as well as practicing  
throwing skill under pre- fatigue  conditions.54 
Dynamic shoulder stability is derived from muscular as well as neuromuscul ar control. Recent 
research has shown that the quality of an individual’s proprioception is associ ated with the level at 
which they perform in their sport.56 It may therefore be expected water polo athletes would 
demonstrate superior proprioception; however in sports involving overhead activ ities, the shoulder can 
show proprioceptive deficits .36, 57, 58 Joint proprioception has been shown to be impaired further into 
range in people with chronic shoulder injuries.59-61 The increased ROM developed from repeated 
throwing may, over time, induce trauma to the shoulder capsule damaging mec hanoreceptors, 
reducing afferent input and increasing the risk of shoulder injury .36, 62 In baseball , repetitive throwing 
has been shown to reduce proprioception acuity but not an athlete’ s shoulder strength .62 Despite 
reduced proprioception, power remained unaffected , suggesting an increase d injury risk from the 
impact of fatigue on proprioception, before a reduction in performance was observed. There is lim ited 
research of mechanisms to  enhanc e proprioception; however, it is known that improved proprioception 
is trainable in the  lower leg and the knee region.63 Preliminary work suggests reduced proprioception 
15 | Page  
 in water polo players may increase the risk of injury.36 To date , no study has measured proprioception  
of water polo athletes in t heir aquatic playing environment. Accordingly, p otential exists for 
proprioceptive training of the shoulder region to be applied within a water polo context but further 
research is required with high ecological validity, a larger sample size and incl usive of both male and 
female athletes for a more robust analysis of the correlation of proprioception and injury risk.  
This systematic review was li mited by the heterogeneity of the included studies preventing 
quantitative statistical analysis. Results reporting was biased by lack of cons ensus regarding the 
definition of injury, as some studies did not include a working definition o f injury30, 32, 37, injury 
severity7, 23, 30 or athlete exposure/risk.7, 24, 30 Included studies were of a small study size,15, 25, 31, 36 and 
are limited by the risk of recall bias due to self -report questionnaires,8, 24 no control group in 
intervention studies,25, 31, 32 and non-homogenous groups at baseline.14, 37 Differences in 
methodological quality of the included studies were compared, however reader s are cautioned when 
interpreti ng results as some selected outcome measures may not have been sensitive to detect change 
(measurement bias).5, 33, 35Results are further limited by selection bias and may not be generalisable to  
the wider water  polo population due to inclusion of elite athletes only.5, 7, 8, 14, 15, 20, 22, 25, 32 -34, 37

 v. Conclusion  
Review of the c urrent literature indicates that shoulder pain and injury are common in water polo with 
reported rates for male players ranging from 24% – 51%. Risk for shoulder injury is multifactorial , 
however the relative contribution of intrinsic factors remains unclear.  
Future i mplications for research  include development of normative data sets in water polo regarding 
shoulder ROM, strength ratio and proprioception. Simultaneously, further prospective analysis with a 
clear definition of injury incidence and rate and that details time l oss/injury severity is required. 
Results would enable more targeted and comprehensive injury prevention interv entions to be 
developed by physiotherapists, coaches and strength and conditioning trainers.   
Practical implications for training include monitoring individual athlete s’ shot frequency and rest 
intervals in conjunction with daily shoulder pain reporting to allow individualised athlet e loading. 
Regular musculoskeletal screening of water polo players for risk factors fo r shoulder injury is advised 
and should include; v isual assessment of athlete ’s posture an d rating of scapular dyskinesis to enable 
targeted muscle  stretching prescription. Similarly, m easurement and preservation of IR ROM needs to 
be monitored and assessment and  maintenance of  shoulder ER strength relative to IR, to ensure a 
minimum ratio of I R:ER of 1.0:0.67 is achieved . Alongside posture, ROM, strength, daily pain and 
training load monitoring, neuromuscular assessment and post-injury retraining a re recommended.

 vi. Practical implications  
• For injury prevention, m onitoring individual athlete loading and daily reported shoulder pain is 
encouraged.  
• Visual assessment for scapular dyskinesis pre and post training can enable targeted shoulder 
stretching prescription. 
• Measurement and preservation of  dominant/throwing arm IR ROM is recommended.  
• A shoulder strength ratio for IR:ER > 1.0: 0.67 is desirable . 
• For performance outcome, i ncreased overall athlete fitness may improve athlete’s goal 
shooting accuracy.

subscapularis, infraspinatus  tendon and posterior 
labrum (p=0.001, p=0.24, p=0.041). O ther 
structures demonstrated no statistical difference 
including supraspinatous.  
 
All throwing shoulders showed abnormal 
findings in MRI but only 29% (n=8) were 
symptomatic. Mean age of control 30y

All participants with previous Cx injury had 
poor abdominal posture and Lx posture. Of 
those with recent shoulder injury 66.67% had 
poor shoulder posture.  Adolescent population, 
results may be affected by 
developmental postural 
changes .  6/12
