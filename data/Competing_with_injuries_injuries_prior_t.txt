Background Injury and illness surveillance is the
foundation for the development of prevention strategies.
Objective To examine injuries among the aquatic
disciplines in the 4 weeks prior to and during the 2013
FINA World Championships.
Methods The study was comprised of two
components: (1) a retrospective athlete survey recording
injuries in the 4 weeks prior to the Championships and
(2) a prospective recording of injuries and illnesses by
the medical teams of the participating countries and the
local host medical team.
Results One-third of the 1116 responding athletes
reported an injury/physical complaint in the 4 weeks
prior to the Championships. Signi ﬁcantly more women
(36.7%) than men (28.6%) reported injuries. Divers
reported the highest rate of injury/physical complaints
(55.7%). At the start of the Championships, 70% of
injured respondents (n=258) were still symptomatic;
however, full participation was expected by 76%. During
the Championships, 186 new injuries were reported
(8.3/100 registered athletes) with the highest injury
incidence rate in water polo (15.3/100 registered
athletes). The most common injured body part was the
shoulder (21%). A total of 199 illnesses were reported
during the Championships (9.0/100 registered athletes)
with the most common diagnosis of illness being
gastrointestinal infection. Environmental exposure
(allergy, otitis and jelly ﬁsh stings) was responsible for
27% of all illnesses in open water swimming.
Conclusions Injuries pose a signi ﬁcant health risk
for elite aquatic athletes. A prospective study would
improve understanding of out-of-competition injuries.
Future injury and illness surveillance at FINA World
Championships is required to direct and measure the
impact of prevention strategies.
INTRODUCTION
From the recreational to the elite level, aquatic
sports are universally popular around the world. In
2013, FINA, the international federation governing
aquatic sports, held its 15th W orld Championships
in Barcelona, Spain involving 2223 athletes from
177 countries competing in 68 events in the disci-
plines of swimming, water polo, diving, synchro-
nised swimming and open water swimming. The
30 m platform diving event was introduced at these
Championships.
FINA implemented its ﬁrst injury surveillance at
its W orld Championships in Rome 2009.1W aterpolo was included in the injury surveillance study of
team sports during the 2004 Olympic Games,2and
all aquatic disciplines were surveyed in the 20083
and 20124Olympic Games. Illness surveillance was
implemented in the FINA W orld Championships
20091and in the 2012 Olympic Games.4
Results from the 2009 survey revealed that
overuse (37.5%) was the most common mechanism
for injury.1Similarly, at the 2012 Olympic Games,
diving had the highest incidence of overuse injuries
(73%) compared to all sports.4The injury registra-
tion methodology utilised in the FINA and IOC
injury surveillance studies, however, only records
newly acquired injuries without capturing injuries
incurred during training. Athletes may continue to
train and compete despite injury and other physical
complaints, especially in the time period before
major competitions.
T o facilitate the development of future preven-
tion strategies for aquatic athletes, this study (1)
assessed the presence and characteristics of injuries
and physical complaints in the 4 weeks prior to and
at the start of the FINA W orld Championships
2013 and (2) described the incidence and nature of
new-onset injuries and illnesses incurred during
competition.
METHODS
The study was implemented at the 2013 FINA
W orld Championships in Barcelona, Spain. The
Championships consisted of competitions in six
disciplines, and the study population included all
registered athletes. Informed consent was obtained
via the athlete entry form. Ethical approval was
obtained from the University of Oslo, School of
Medicine Ethical Committee and the Collegi
Oﬁcial de Metges de Barcelona.
The study involved two components: (1) a retro-
spective questionnaire on injuries and physical
complaints in the 4 weeks prior to and at the start
of the Championships to be completed by the ath-
letes and (2) a prospective survey of new-onset
injuries and illnesses reported by the local organis-
ing committee (LOC) and national medical teams.
Retrospective questionnaire on prior complaints
A retrospective survey on athletes ’injuries and
physical complaints during the 4 weeks prior to the
Championships was developed to capture the pres-
ence, number, location and duration of injuries and

physical complaints, as well as their effect on training and com-
petition performance (see online supplementary appendix 1). It
included a modi ﬁed, extended version of the four questions of
the Oslo Sports T rauma Research Centre questionnaire.5
Athletes were asked to report all injuries or other physical
complaints that they experienced in the 4 weeks prior to the
Championships, regardless of the consequences for participation
in normal training and/or competition. These outcomes are sub-
sequently referred to as ‘prior complaints ’. The questionnaire
was available in English, French and Spanish. Athletes received
the questionnaires from their team physician, and returned
them prior to or during the event either in person to a member
of the research team or via secure locked drop boxes located in
the training and competition venues and the FINA of ﬁce.
Prospective survey on new-onset injuries and illnesses
The prospective injury and illness surveillance was based on the
IOC protocol,6previously implemented at the 2009 FINA
W orld Championships.1The injury and illness report form was
available in English, French, Spanish, Italian and Russian. Daily
reporting by the team physician and LOC medical staff was
accomplished electronically or via a secured drop box.
Implementation
The purpose and logistics of the study were communicated elec-
tronically to the National Federations and team physicians regis-
tered in the FINA database 3 months prior to the
Championships. The FINA Bureau Sports Medicine Liaison
(MM) undertook a pre-event site visit to train the LOC medical
staff. Prior to the opening ceremony and prior to the start of
the second week, an educational session was held for all
national federation and LOC physicians. The study logistics
were also presented at the technical meetings of each discipline.
During the competitions, members of the FINA Study Group
attended every competition event to encourage reporting com-
pliance. Injury and illness data gathered by the LOC from the
training/competition sites, medical clinics, athlete hotels and
the Championship hospital network were obtained daily from
the Chief Medical Of ﬁcer ’s utilisation report database. There
was a daily review of the quality of the data and an analysis of
reporting compliance. The medical staff of non-compliant coun-
tries were subsequently contacted to encourage reporting.
Duplication of data entries of injuries and illnesses was resolved
by the consensus of MM and AJ.
Deﬁnitions and calculation of exposure data and incidences
A discipline was de ﬁned as one of the six aquatic sports (swim-
ming, diving, high diving, open water swimming, synchronised
swimming and water polo). An event was de ﬁned as a competi-
tion activity if medals were awarded (eg, 1, 3 and 10 m diving).
The number of competing athletes in the individual events was
calculated from the of ﬁcial start lists.7Athletes starting in differ-
ent events were included for each event. Athletes who did not
ﬁnish or were disquali ﬁed were included as competing athletes.
The number of starts was calculated using the of ﬁcial results
list.7For the individual sports, all results (including disquali ﬁ-
cations and athletes who did not ﬁnish) were each included as
a start; for example, an athlete competing in the heats, semi ﬁ-
nals and ﬁnals of a swimming event was counted as three
starts. Athletes who started in different disciplines (eg, swim-
ming and open water swimming) were counted for each discip-
line. For swimming relays, synchronised swimming events,
synchronised diving and open water swimming team events,
the number of starts was calculated by multiplying the number

of athletes on a team by the number of entries. For water
polo, the number of starts was calculated as the number of
player-matches (2 teams×7 players × the number of matches
played).
The number of athlete competition days was calculated by
multiplying the number of registered athletes in each discipline
by the total number of days of competition for the respective
discipline as per the of ﬁcial competition schedule.7
Calculation of incidences and data analysis
Incidence rates were calculated as the number of injuries or ill-
nesses per 100 registered or competing athletes in the respective
discipline.6
Data were processed using Excel and SPSS. The statistical
methods applied were descriptive statistics, cross tabulations, χ2
and t tests. For incidence rates, 95% CIs were calculated.
Statistical signi ﬁcance was accepted at a p value of 0.05 or lower.
RESULTS
Number and exposure of athletes
A total of 2223 athletes from 177 countries registered for the
2013 FINA W orld Championships that resulted in almost
20 000 athlete competition days. As most athletes, except high
divers and water polo players, competed in more than one
event, the number of competing athletes was almost double the
number of registered athletes. Overall, more female (53%) than
male athletes (47%) participated. The athletes ’ages range from
12 to 41 years with an average of 22.2 years (SD 4.42). For
further details on the characteristics of the athletes and their
exposure see table 1 .
Retrospective questionnaire on prior complaints
A total of 1116 athletes (610 women and 500 men) completed
the retrospective survey of prior complaints, representing an
overall response rate of 50.2%, varying by discipline from 38.6%(diving) to 81% (high diving). Survey responders and non-
responders were similar in age and gender, but were statistically
different with regard to distribution by discipline ( table 2 ).
Approximately one-third of the responding athletes (n=368;
33%) reported a physical complaint in the 4 weeks prior to the
Championships. The duration of prior complaints varied from
7 days to 10 years with a median duration of 85.3 days. The
mean age of athletes with and without prior complaints was
similar. Signi ﬁcantly more females (n=224; 36.7%) than males
(n=143; 28.6%) reported prior complaints ( χ2=7.83;
p<0.005), and the proportion of athletes with a prior complaint
differed with statistical signi ﬁcance between disciplines
(χ2=68.2; p<0.001). More than half of the divers (55.7%)
reported prior complaints compared to only 17.4% of open
water swimmers.
More than three quarters of athletes with prior complaints
(n=273; 76%) reported full participation in training in the
4 weeks leading up to the Championships, but only 57 (17%)
reported that their performance had not been affected due to
injury . The median number of days of limited sport participation
was 6. High diving and water polo had the greatest number of
days of limited performance.
At the start of the Championships, less than one-third of ath-
letes with prior complaints (30.9%) reported no current symp-
toms, 47.5% minor symptoms, 18.3% moderate symptoms and
2.5% severe symptoms. More than half (53.4%) reported no
effect on performance from their prior complaints at the begin-
ning of the Championships. In contrast, four athletes were
unable to participate in the Championships and 1.4%, despite
being severely affected, still competed.
Prospective survey on new-onset injuries and illnesses
during the Championships
The medical staff from 55 (31.1%) countries submitted 587
injury and illness report forms covering a total of 1571 athletes

(70.7%; table 3 ). A total of 186 injuries were reported, repre-
senting an incidence of 8.3/100 registered athletes (95% CI
±1.19). The highest injury incidence was observed in water
polo, followed by open water swimming and diving, and the
lowest incidence was seen in synchronised swimming. The inci-
dence of injuries was higher in training (3.61; 95% CI ±0.78)
than in competition (2.4; 95% CI ±0.48). No other differences
were found. Thirty-two injuries (17%) were reported to result
in time loss, equivalent to an incidence of 1.4/100 athletes
(95% CI ±0.49). Information on time loss was missing for 58
(31.2%) injuries. The rate of time-loss injuries was lower in
male athletes (1.34; 95% CI ±0.7) than in female athletes
(1.53; 95% CI ±0).
The most common injured body part was the shoulder
(n=39; 21%; ﬁgure 1 ). Almost half (49%) of the shoulder injur-
ies and two-thirds of the time-loss shoulder injuries were
reported in swimming. W ater polo was responsible fortwo-thirds (n=23) of all injuries to the head/neck. The most
common injury type was contusion (n=38; 20.4%), and the
most frequent injury type was tendinosis of the shoulder
(n=17). The most common cause of injury was contact with
another athlete (n=46; 24.7%). Eight per cent of the reported
injuries resulted in time loss of 1 –2 weeks duration, and one-
quarter of all time-loss injuries were to the shoulder (n=28).
Data on time loss were missing in 53 (28%) cases.
A total of 199 illnesses were reported during the
Championships, resulting in an incidence of 9/100 registered
athletes (95% CI ±1.25). There was no signi ﬁcant statistical dif-
ference between the number of illnesses reported in male (8.8;
95% CI ±1.8) and female (9.1; 95% CI ±1.72) athletes. The
highest rate of illness was reported in open water swimmers
while no illnesses were reported in high divers ( table 3 ). The
most common diagnosis of illness was gastrointestinal infection,
with environmental exposure resulting in allergic reactions,
otitis and jelly ﬁsh stings in open water swimming accounting for
27% of all reported illnesses ( ﬁgure 2 ). T wenty- ﬁve illnesses
were reported to result in time loss, resulting in a rate of 1.1
(95% CI ±0.43) time-loss injuries per 100 registered athletes.
Data on time loss were missing in 64 (32%) cases. The highest
rate of time-loss illnesses was observed in water polo.
DISCUSSION
Accurate injury surveillance is a fundamental component of
effective risk management in sport.8–11Despite the fact that
out-of-competition prospective cohort studies are recommended
to monitor injury patterns and risk,12–15no studies of this type
have been undertaken in aquatic sport disciplines. T wo studies,
one prospective study monitoring shoulder pain in Australian
swimmers16and one descriptive retrospective epidemiological
study17in NCAA swimming, have been published.
Retrospective questionnaire of prior complaints
The retrospective com ponent of this study is the ﬁrst to evalu-
ate the presence of out-of-competition injuries in inter-
national, elite aquatic athletes. Despite employing a narrow
recall period of 4 weeks and a research population comprising
only elite athletes, limitations to the accuracy of the retro-
spective survey exist with a potential for underestimation of
injuries related to a potential recall bias.18 19The more severe
injuries of athletes who are subsequently unable to qualify for
the FINA W orld Championships were not captured in this
study. As such, the injury rates reported in this study are most
likely an underestimation of the actual injury rates in elite
aquatic athletes. In contrast, a strength of this survey was the
recording of athlete symptoms rather than diagnoses, which
allowed for greater capture of performance affecting physical
complaints by bypassing the potential reporting bias of third
party recorders who may interpret differently a recordable
problem. This approach provided a more accurate interpret-
ation of the effect that physical complaints may have on ath-
letic performance.13 14
The survey responses demonstrated that almost a third of all
athletes reported complaints, with 70% of them reporting prior
complaints symptomatic at the commencement of the
Championships. Despite these ﬁndings, the majority still partici-
pated in training, stating that their athletic performance was
affected by their prior complaint at the start of the competition.
Thisﬁnding is consistent with the literature outlining that ath-
letes across sport disciplines continue to train despite injury13
and demonstrates the need for interventions to address the pre-
vention of non-time-loss injuries. Further research in aquatic

sports is required to determine whether symptomatic athletes
are more vulnerable as previous injury is a known risk factor for
injury.9T o achieve this end, prospective out-of-competition sur-
veillance together with the standard in-competition protocol is
recommended.

FINA W orld Championships was signi ﬁcantly higher than in
2009.1This trend may be due to an increasingly tougher com-
petition or to a busier competition calendar with a consequent
decreased recovery period and a subsequent increased injury
risk. It may also be attributed to the improved familiarity of
team physicians with the injury surveillance system since a
higher response rate was achieved in 2013 compared to theFINA W orld Championships 2009.1A similar trend was
observed in the Olympic Games.342 0Ongoing injury surveil-
lance is required to decrease this reporting bias.
Consistent with previous published research,11 62 1 –25the
shoulder was the most commonly injured body part in aquatic
sports. Despite the various theories of risk factors and injury
mechanisms,16 25 26shoulder injury prevention programmes for
aquatic sports have not been validated in the scienti ﬁc literature.
Theﬁndings of the present study illustrate the need for a vali-
dated shoulder injury prevention programme in the aquatic
disciplines.
In the current study, the head and neck regions were the
second most commonly reported injury locations. This unex-
pectedﬁnding was in ﬂuenced by water polo, which reported
more than 60% of all head and neck injuries. W ater polo data
also reﬂected the highest injury risk of all the aquatic disci-
plines with a higher number of head and neck injuries
reported than shoulder injuries. A pragmatic approach to
injury prevention in water polo would include a review of the
current rules, de-emphasising c ontact, highlighting fair play
and supporting the capacity of referees to sanction. These
measures have been implemented in team sports such as foot-
ball and rugby .27–32
Prospective survey on illnesses
Statistically signi ﬁcantly more illnesses were reported during the
2013 FINA W orld Championships than in 2009 (7.1/100
athletes; 95% CI 1.03).1This could have been in ﬂuenced by the
environmental risk variability between Barcelona (2013)
and Rome (2009), and also as a result of the improved
athlete healthcare provision and improved reporting
quality. Consistent with other sports, infection was the leading
cause of illness.42 03 3 –36However, less upper respiratory infec-
tions were reported in 2013 (n=36; 18%) than in 20091
(n=91; 50.3%), possibly attributed to the presence of hand
sterilising stations on site and the education of athletes on
personal hygiene.37
Of particular concern was the reported frequency of otitis in
all athletes (15% of all illnesses) and jelly ﬁsh stings in open
water swimmers (38% of illnesses in open water swimmers).
These results demonstrate the need for the implementation of
targeted preventive measures. The environmental risk posed by
jellyﬁsh warrants a closer evaluation of open water venues to
develop risk reduction measures and the provision of appropri-
ate medication for the treatment of potential anaphylactic
emergencies.
CONCLUSION
This study demonstrates the need to investigate out-of-competi-
tion (training) injury patterns in aquatic sports through pro-
spective injury surveillance in aquatic sports. In-competition
injury and illness surveillance should continue to gain further
insight into trends and to evaluate the ef ﬁcacy of prevention
interventions. While the disciplines of swimming, diving and
synchronised swimming have low injury rates relative to other
sports, water polo has a uniquely higher propensity for injury
distinctively affecting the head, neck and shoulder.
Implementation of prevention interventions should target the
discipline of water polo, shoulder and head injuries, as well as
aquatic-speci ﬁc illnesses such as jelly ﬁsh stings and otitis.

What are the new ﬁndings?
▸One-third of all participating athletes reported having
suffered physical complaints/injuries in the 4 weeks prior to
the 2013 FINA World Championships.
▸Diving and water polo had the highest incidence of physical
complaints/injuries in the 4 weeks prior to the
Championships relative to the other aquatic disciplines.
▸Female aquatic athletes had a higher rate of physical
complaints/injury than male aquatic athletes in the 4 weeks
prior to the Championships.
▸The incidence of new-onset injuries during the FINA World
Championships was 8.3% with the highest incidence in
water polo; and the illness incidence was 9% with the
highest incidence in open water swimming.
▸The most common injuries were contusions of the head and
overuse injuries of the shoulder, and the most common
illnesses were gastrointestinal and respiratory infections.
▸How might it impact on clinical practice in the near future?
▸Injury surveillance programmes in all aquatic disciplines
should expand to capture data during the training season
speciﬁcally in the time period leading up to a major
competition.
▸Prevention interventions should be developed to focus on
injuries suffered during the out-of-competition (training)
period.
▸An analysis of the water polo rules should be implemented to
address the injury patterns unique to this aquatic discipline.
▸Injury prevention strategies in all aquatic disciplines should
target shoulder and head injuries.
▸Evaluation of environment factors in open water swimming
is required.
