Abstract
Background/Aim— Recent injury data for collegiate-level swimming and diving is limited. 
Previous data is limited to single seasons, elite and national team athletes, or emergency 
department data. This study describes the epidemiology of men’s and women’s swimming and 
diving injuries reported by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Injury 
Surveillance Program (ISP) during the 2009/10-2013/14 academic years.
Methods— Injuries and athlete-exposure (AE) data reported within nine men’s and 13 women’s 
swimming and diving programs were analyzed. Injury rates, injury rate ratios (IRR), and injury 
proportions by body site, diagnosis, and mechanism were reported with 95% confidence intervals 
(CI).
Results— The ISP captured 149 and 208 injuries for men’s and women’s swimming and diving, 
respectively, leading to injury rates of 1.54/1000AEs and 1.71/1000AEs. Among females, divers 
had a higher injury rate (2.49/1000AEs) than swimmers (1.63/1000AEs; IRR=1.53; 95%CI: 1.07, 
2.19). Injury rates for male divers (1.94/1000AEs) and swimmers (1.48/1000AEs) did not differ 
(IRR=1.33; 95%CI: 0.85, 2.31). Most injuries occurred to the shoulder and resulted in strains. 
Many injuries were classified as overuse or non-contact. Female swimmers had a higher overuse 
injury rate (1.04/1000AEs) than male swimmers (0.66/1000AEs; IRR=1.58; 95%CI: 1.14, 2.19). 
Overuse injury rates for female divers (0.54/1000AEs) and male divers (0.46/1000AEs) did not 
differ (IRR=1.16; 95%CI: 0.40, 3.34).

INTRODUCTION
The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) has sanctioned championship events 
in men’s swimming and diving since 1937[ 1] and women’s swimming and diving since 
1982.[ 2] In the 2013/14 academic year, 9,630 men and 12,333 women participated in NCAA 
swimming and diving.[ 3] Collegiate swimmers compete in events ranging from 50 to 1,500 
meters, utilizing at least one of four strokes: freestyle, backstroke, breaststroke, or butterfly. 
Collegiate divers compete in one-meter springboard, three-meter springboard, and/or 
platform diving (Division I only). Points are awarded for all events based on placement. The 
sum of the swimming and diving points yields the total swimming and diving team score.
The preparation for swimming involves a high training volume and exertion[ 4, 5] This 
coupled with the repetitive nature of swimming coupled have previously been asserted as 
major risk factors for overuse injury.[ 6-8] Previous studies[ 5-13] have also found high 
frequencies of shoulder injuries, with shoulder pain being a major cause of missed practices 
and poor performance.[ 14] However, these studies are limited in that they utilize small 
sample sizes generally from one season and/or one swimming program.
There is also a dearth of research that utilizes large populations of divers over a substantial 
period of time. Instead, most data originates from case studies,[ 15, 16] case series,[ 17] and 
observations from a single championship competition.[ 18-20] One surveillance study 
utilized National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) data to examine diving-
related injuries of individuals <20 years old presenting at United States emergency 
departments. This study found large proportions of injuries to the head/face/neck, that 
resulted in lacerations and soft tissue injuries, and were caused by collision with the diving 
board or platform.[ 21] Another study found that Junior Olympic divers had injury histories 
including fractures and strains.[ 22] More specifically, due to repetitive hyperextension of the 
back, diving has been associated with lumbar spondylolysis and low back pain.[ 22-24] Also, 
concussion research in diving is limited, although they are hypothesized to occur from 
deceleration upon entering the water.[ 25]
Given the large number of athletes involved in swimming and diving, understanding the 
patterns, mechanisms, and risk factors of injury in this population is critical. The NCAA 
Injury Surveillance Program (ISP) has monitored all injuries occurring in a sample of men’s 
and women’s swimming and diving varsity teams. This study utilizes data from the NCAA 
ISP to describe the epidemiology of men’s and women’s swimming and diving injuries 
occurring within the NCAA competition level during the 2009/10-2013/14 academic years.Kerr et al. Page 2

METHODS
Data from the 2009/10-2013/14 academic years were obtained from the NCAA ISP, a 
prospective surveillance program that is managed by the Datalys Center for Sports Injury 
Research and Prevention (hereafter known as the Datalys Center), an independent, nonprofit 
research organization. This study was approved by the [name removed for blind review], 
with student-athletes from participating teams providing consent at the beginning of each 
academic year.
Sample
Men’s swimming and diving data originated from nine varsity programs that contributed 23 
team-seasons. Each team-season included an average 22.8 swimmers and 3.5 divers. 
Women’s swimming and diving data originated from 13 varsity NCAA women’s swimming 
and diving programs that contributed 30 team-seasons. Each team-season included an 
average 22.4 swimmers and 3.2 divers.
Data collection
The methodology of the NCAA ISP during the 2009/10-2013/14 academic years has been 
previously described.[ 26] The ISP utilized a convenience sample of NCAA varsity sport 
teams with athletic trainers (ATs) reporting injury data. These ATs worked with these 
participating teams and attended school-sanctioned practices and competitions. When 
injuries occurred, the ATs reported them in real-time through the electronic health record 
application used by the team medical staff throughout the academic year. In addition to 
musculoskeletal injuries, the surveillance system captured other sports-related adverse 
health events such as illness, heat-related conditions, general medical conditions, and skin 
infections. Only varsity level practice and competition events and team conditioning 
sessions were included in the ISP data sets. Individual weight lifting and conditioning 
sessions were excluded.
For each event, the AT completed a detailed event report on the injury or condition (e.g., 
site, diagnosis) and the circumstances (e.g., activity, mechanism, event type [i.e., 
competition or practice]). For swimming events, the AT specified which stroke was being 
performed. The ATs were able to view and update previously submitted information as 
needed during the course of a season. In addition, ATs also provided the number of student-
athletes participating in each practice and competition.
From the electronic health record application, common data elements that included injury 
and exposure information were stripped of any identifiers and personally identifiable 
information and retained only relevant variables and values.[ 26] The frequency of export or 
submission of data varied slightly among vendors providing the electronic health record 
applications to team medical staff. This common data element standard allows ATs to 
document injuries as they normally would as part of their daily clinical practice, as opposed 
to having them separately report injuries for injury surveillance program purposes. All 
electronic health record applications must have successfully complete a data-validation 
process to be certified.Kerr et al. Page 3

Exported data passed through an automated verification process that conducted a series of 
consistency checks. Data were reviewed and flagged for invalid values. The AT and data 
quality assurance staff were notified and worked together to resolve the issue. Data that 
passed the verification process were then placed into the men’s and women’s swimming and 
diving aggregate datasets.
Definitions
A reportable injury in the ISP was defined as an injury that: occurred as a result of 
participation in an organized intercollegiate practice/competition and required attention from 
an AT or physician. Multiple injuries occurring from one injury event could be included.
A reportable athlete-exposure (AE) was defined as one student-athlete participating in one 
NCAA-sanctioned practice or competition in which he or she was exposed to the possibility 
of athletic injury, regardless of the time associated with that participation. Only athletes with 
actual playing time in a competition were included in competition exposures.
Body parts were categorized as: head/face, neck, shoulder/clavicle, arm/elbow, hand/wrist, 
trunk (including chest, abdomen, upper back, and lower back), hip/groin, thigh/upper leg, 
knee, lower leg (including the Achilles), ankle, foot, and other. Injuries were also 
categorized by the number of days in which athletes were restricted from participation. First, 
non-time loss injuries were those injuries that resulted in restriction of participation less than 
24 hours; however, this excluded concussions, fractures, and dental injuries, which were 
considered time loss injuries, regardless of reported time loss. The inclusion of these injuries 
as time loss is typical in injury surveillance.[ 27, 28] Second, severe injuries were those 
injuries that resulted in time loss over three weeks.[ 29] These severe injuries may have also 
resulted in the student-athletes prematurely ending their season (i.e., season-ending injury).
Classifying injuries and athlete-exposures by swimming versus diving
Student-athletes were grouped either swimmers or divers. If a student-athlete’s injury record 
did not include their sport, we contacted ATs from their school to obtain such information. 
For AEs, we consulted historical team rosters for participating programs to decipher the 
ratio of swimmers to divers. The AEs documented for that school for that year were then 
distributed based upon these ratios. This distribution assumes that swimmers and divers 
participated in the same number of practices and competitions across a season. Thus, if a 
school’s men’s swimming and diving program had 27 swimmers and 3 divers (i.e., 9:1 
ratio), and 200 competition AEs in the 2011/12 academic year, then we would assume that 
swimmers and divers had accounted for 180 and 20 of the competition AEs, respectively. 
ATs from participating programs confirmed our methodology that swimmers and divers 
participated in approximately the same number of practices and competitions across a 
season.
Statistical analysis
Data were analyzed to assess rates and patterns of college men’s and women’s swimming 
and diving injuries. Data were analyzed using SAS-Enterprise Guide software (version 4.3; 
SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Statistical analyses included calculation of rate ratios (IRRs), Kerr et al. Page 4
Br J Sports Med . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2016 April 01.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript
injury proportion ratios (IPRs), and chi-square tests ( χ2) tests. The overall injury rate was 
calculated as the ratio of injuries per 1,000 total AEs. Injury rates were also calculated as the 
ratio of practice injuries per 1,000 practice exposures and the ratio of competition injuries 
per 1,000 competition exposures. The following is an example of an IRR comparing 
competition and practice injury rates:
The following is an example of an IPR comparing the proportion of shoulder injuries 
sustained in male and female divers:
All 95% confidence intervals (CIs) not containing 1.00 were considered statistically 
significant. Because of statistical power concerns in time trends, we grouped years as 
2009/10-2011/12 and 2012/13-2013/14. Also, due to the small number of injuries, the 
majority of analyses utilize the overall count of injuries, as opposed to stratifying by 
competition and practice.
RESULTS
Overall frequencies and rates
Men’s swimming and diving— The ATs reported 149 injuries during 2009/10-2013/14 
in college men’s swimming and diving, of which 124 (83.2%) and 25 (16.8%) occurred to 
swimmers and divers, respectively. A total of 133 (89.3%) occurred during practice; 16 
occurred during competition (10.7%). Most injuries occurred in the regular season (61.7%); 
36.2% and 2.0% occurred in the preseason and postseason, respectively. In addition, 77.2% 
were non-time loss and 2.7% were severe. Four injuries (2.7%) required surgery.
These 149 injuries occurred during 96,745 AEs, for an injury rate of 1.54/1000AEs (95%CI: 
1.29, 1.79; Table 1). No difference existed between the injury rates for practice 
(1.50/1000AEs) and competition (1.93/1000AEs; IRR=0.78; 95%CI: 0.46, 1.30). When 
injury rates were stratified by athlete-type, injury rates for male divers (1.94/1000AEs) and 
swimmers (1.48/1000AEs) did not differ (IRR=1.33; 95%CI: 0.85, 2.31).
Women’s swimming and diving— The ATs reported 208 injuries during 
2009/10-2013/14 in college women’s swimming and diving, of which 171 (82.2%) and 37 
(17.8%) occurred to swimmers and divers, respectively. A total of 190 (82.2%) occurred 
during practice; 18 occurred during competition (17.8%). Most injuries occurred in the 
regular season (62.0%); 35.6% and 2.4% occurred in the preseason and postseason, Kerr et al. Page 5

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript
respectively. In addition, 72.6% were non-time loss and 2.9% were severe. Four injuries 
(1.9%) required surgery.
These 208 injuries occurred during 121,719 AEs, for an injury rate of 1.71/1000AEs 
(95%CI: 1.48, 1.94; Table 1). No difference existed between the injury rates for practice 
(1.72/1000AEs) and competition (1.61/1000AEs; IRR=1.07; 95%CI: 0.66, 1.73). When 
injury rates were stratified by athlete-type, divers had a higher injury rate (2.49/1000AEs) 
than swimmers (1.63/1000AEs; IRR=1.53; 95%CI: 1.07, 2.19).
Comparison of rates— There were no gender differences in men’s and women’s 
swimming and diving injury rates overall (Males vs females IRR=0.90; 95%CI: 0.73, 1.11), 
for practices (IRR=0.87; 95%CI: 0.70, 1.09), or for competitions (IRR=1.20; 95%CI: 0.61, 
2.36). Injury rates did not differ between male and female swimmers (IRR=0.91; 95%CI: 
0.72, 1.15) or divers (IRR=0.78; 95%CI: 0.47, 1.29).
Time trends— In men’s swimming and diving, there were no differences in injury rates for 
men’s swimmers or divers between the two time periods (2009/10-2011/12 and 
2012/13-2013/14) (Figure 1). However, in women’s swimming and diving, there was a 30% 
reduction in the swimming injury rate from 2009/10-2011/12 to 2012/13-2013/14 
(IRR=0.70; 95%CI: 0.52, 0.95). There was also a 44% reduction in the diving injury rate, 
although this change was not significant (IRR=0.56; 95%CI: 0.30, 1.08).
Body sites injured and diagnoses
Most injuries occurred to the shoulder in men’s swimming, (34.7%), men’s diving (32.0%), 
and women’s swimming (31.3%) (Table 2). However, in women’s diving, the trunk 
comprised the largest proportion of injuries (37.8%). There were no gender differences in 
body part-specific injury rates among swimmers or divers. However, male divers sustained a 
greater proportion of shoulder injuries (32.0%) than female divers (5.4%; IPR=5.92; 95%CI: 
1.37, 25.59).
The most common injury diagnosis was strains in men’s swimming (21.8%), men’s diving 
(20.0%), women’s swimming (17.0%), and women’s diving (16.2% (Table 3). In addition, 
swimmers had large proportions of entrapment/impingement (men: 14.5%; women: 11.1%) 
and tendonitis (men: 13.7%; women: 15.8%). There were no gender differences in 
diagnosis-specific injury rates or proportions among swimmers or divers.
Table 4 summarizes common injuries for men’s and women’s swimming and diving and the 
percentage of time-loss injuries. For the three concussions in women’s diving, two occurred 
from contact with the water and one occurred from contact with the diving board. In 
addition, zero cases of spondylolysis and four cases of lower back pain were reported.
Mechanism of injury and activity
The majority of injuries were classified as overuse (men’s swimming: 44.4%; men’s diving: 
24.0%; women’s swimming: 63.7%; women’s diving: 21.6%) and non-contact (men’s 
swimming: 25.0%; men’s diving: 28.0%; women’s swimming: 17.0; women’s diving: 
27.0%; Table 5). Contact with water also accounted for large proportions of injuries in Kerr et al. Page 6

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript
men’s and women’s diving (32.0% and 16.2%, respectively). Female swimmers had a 
higher rate of overuse injuries (1.04/1000AEs) than male swimmers (0.66/1000AEs; 
IRR=1.58; 95%CI: 1.14, 2.19). No gender differences in injury mechanism existed among 
divers. Among swimmers, the largest proportion of injuries occurred while swimming the 
medley (men: 45.2%; women: 45.6%). There were no gender differences in activity-specific 
injury rates or proportions among swimmers or divers.
DISCUSSION
Swimming and diving are treated as one NCAA team although they are two discrete sports. 
Our study utilized injury surveillance data to describe the epidemiology of men’s and 
women’s swimming and diving at the NCAA level over the past five years. The study adds 
to the literature on men’s and women’s swimming and diving injuries, using data that has 
been thoroughly checked for errors prior to landing in data sets.[ 26] This study also captured 
both time loss and non-time loss injuries in an effort to optimally summarize the types of 
injuries managed and treated by team medical staff. Such data can help identify areas for 
prevention and health care related to injuries in swimming and diving.
Previous studies have utilized varying methods to report swimming injuries, leading to 
disparate reported rates. Mountjoy et al.[ 19, 20] estimated that the injury rate per 100 
swimmers at the 2009 and 2013 world championship events were 2.7 and 6.1, respectively. 
At the 2008 and 2012 Summer Olympics, Junge et al.[ 30] and Engebretsen et al.[ 31] found 
that 3.4% and 5.4% of swimmers were injured, respectively. Studies with college-level 
student-athletes are available, but considered injuries sustained outside of practice and 
competitions (e.g. strength training, non-swimming-related activities). Across five seasons 
of men’s and women’s swimming at a Division I university, Wolf et al.[ 11] reported injury 
rates of 4.00 and 3.78 injuries per 1000 exposures in men’s and women’s swimming, 
respectively. Across seven seasons within a Division I women’s swimming team, 2.12 
injuries per 1000 exposures were reported.[ 12] In these studies, activities outside of 
swimming contributed to 55%-62% of injuries. A smaller study[ 10] of 34 NCAA Division I 
male and female swimmers across one season restricted injuries to those sustained during 
school-sanctioned practices and competitions, yielding an overall rate of 5.55 injuries per 
1000AEs. Our study utilized data from 22 programs and 53 seasons and yielded smaller 
swimming injury rates (men: 1.48/1000AEs; women: 1.63/1000AEs). The NCAA ISP 
currently does not collect injury data occurring during individual strength training and cross 
training sessions. Nevertheless, given the larger sample size and inclusion of all injuries 
from school-sanctioned practices and competitions (time loss and non-time loss), our rates 
may better estimate the true burden of injury during school-sanctioned practices and 
competitions than previously reported.
The low reported injury rate in swimmers may be indicative of the swimming culture more 
so than of the true incidence of injury. In a sample of youth/adolescent swimmers, 95% 
believed that mild shoulder pain was normal and should be tolerated.[ 32] However, only 
14% reported an injury to team medical staff and 72% reporting using pain medication in 
order to participate.[ 32] These findings suggest that swimmers may not associate shoulder 
pain with injury and rather than seeking care from team medical staff, may self-medicate Kerr et al. Page 7

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript
with pain medication. Within the context of the NCAA ISP, it is only when an athlete 
discloses the pain, or when an AT notices the pain, that the injury would be reported.
This need for disclosure is further highlighted by our study and previous studies[ 5-10] 
finding large proportions of shoulder and overuse injuries. In addition, female swimmers 
were more likely to suffer an overuse injury than male swimmers. Previous research has 
suggested that anatomical, physiological, and psychological differences between male and 
female athletes may contribute to increased risk of overuse injury in females.[ 33] Despite 
the possible gender differences in overuse injuries, the cause of overuse injuries among 
swimmers of both genders should be further explored. In particular, future studies should 
examine the adverse effects of rapid increases in the frequency and intensity of training, and 
the protective effects of adequate recovery time. Because swimming heavily relies upon the 
upper extremity to propel the body forward,[ 34] such research should also examine whether 
proper form also mitigates shoulder injuries.[ 35]
Research related to divers is limited. At the 2008 and 2012 Summer Olympics, Junge et al.
[30] and Engebretsen et al.[ 31] found that 2.1% and 8.1% of divers were injured, 
respectively. In our study, divers had a higher injury rate than swimmers, although the 
finding was only significant in females. Diving injuries were mostly strains and to the 
shoulder and trunk. This was similar to findings in Junior Olympic divers,[ 22] but dissimilar 
to emergency department data,[ 21] although such data may exclude less severe injuries. In 
addition, although previous research[ 23, 24] has highlighted the cases of spondylolysis, 
lower back pain, and concussions among divers, ISP data reported zero, four, and three 
cases, respectively. Our sample of 25 male and 37 female diving injuries may not represent 
the true incidence of these injuries among all NCAA swimming and diving programs. Future 
research needs to better estimate the incidence of these rarer injuries.
Limitations
Our findings may not be generalizable to other swimming and diving programs within the 
NCAA or from other levels of competition. The NCAA ISP also does not collect data 
related to activities outside of school-sanctioned practices and competitions, as did previous 
studies [ 11, 12]. Because AEs were unit-based rather than time-, event-, or distance-based, 
we were unable to report injury rates by the number of minutes/hours of practice/
competition, the number of specific events in which athletes participated per competition, or 
the number of meters swam. This recording method reduces reporting burden for 
participating ATs and provides consistency for comparisons across various sports injury 
surveillance research outcomes. Because the NCAA places swimmers and divers on the 
same team, we had to estimate the distribution of AEs between swimmers and divers. As a 
result, caution must be taken when interpreting rate-based results specific to swimmers and 
divers. We utilized historical rosters that identified swimmers and divers on university 
websites as well as guidance from ATs on how to distribute AEs between both types of 
student-athletes. However, these assumptions may not be valid among other collegiate 
programs.Kerr et al. Page 8

Conclusions
Although swimming and diving are two discrete sports, we found shoulder and overuse 
injuries comprised large proportions of injuries among these NCAA student-athletes. As a 
result, future research should examine the causes of overuse injuries among swimmers. 
Collegiate divers may have higher injury rates than swimmers; however, our small sample 
of diving injuries highlights the need for larger samples to better understand the factors that 
contribute to the frequency and severity of injuries sustained by collegiate divers.

WHAT ARE THE NEW FINDINGS
- The study adds to the literature on men’s and women’s swimming and diving 
injuries, using data that has been thoroughly checked for errors prior to landing in 
data sets
- Divers had a higher injury rate than swimmers, although the finding was only 
significant in females
- Female swimmers were more likely to suffer an overuse injury than male 
swimmersKerr et al. Page 11

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript
HOW MIGHT IT IMPACT ON CLINICAL PRACTICE IN THE NEAR FUTURE
- By capturing both time loss and non-time loss injuries, current findings may better 
summarize the types of injuries that are sustained by student-athletes and managed 
and treated by team medical staff
- The large proportions of overuse injuries reported in swimming and diving 
highlight the need to emphasize proper technique and avoid rapid increases in the 
frequency of training to avoid overuse shoulder injuriesKerr et al. Page 12
