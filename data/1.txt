I.  INTRODUCTION PROBLEM AND RESEARCH   
The central nervous system plays a major and vital role in sports performance in all conditions and levels; It is 
responsible for controlling the acc uracy of kinetic performance in terms of strength and speed and determining the 
kinematic directions of the whole body or parts of it. The nervous system also controls harmonic movements by 
coordinating compatibility between the kinematic units of the musc les and the muscle groups and is responsible for all 
movements requiring balance, agility, accurac y in performance, and reflexes.  The true importance of the neuromuscular 
performance in the female student’s swimming sport in the College of Physical Educat ion lies in the fact that it mainly 
depends on the performance of consecutive muscle contractions in a flowing and relatively high speed and that most 
of the basic skills, whether in a team or individual sports, which in turn depend on the compatibility be tween the 
nervous and muscular systems To perform these skills fast, accurate, agile and highly portable.  
The performance of the muscular nervous system in swimming with physical mobility capabilities, which depends 
mainly on the consistency between the work of muscles and nervousness, which is important in the life of the public 
and professional, and when pra cticing various sports activities, especially in sports, which requires a dynamic 
performance where more than one muscle group is used simultaneously Or, move more than one part of the body in 
more than one direction, as is the case in all sports activitie s.

sports activities, especially in swimming and through the development of  cognitive features also contributes to 
improving muscle and nervous work and contributes to coordination between different parts of the body and maintains 
the level of skills performa nce Different kinetics. (10:44) .                                                            
Muscular nervous performance exercises are movements that depend on the organized and coordinated action 
between the nervous and muscular systems. If the coordination between the work of the nervous and muscular systems 
is good, the movement becomes consistent and is expressed through (neuromus cular compatibility), then the individual 
feels the ability to perform well and requires the use of consensual exercises are tools or without tools, and that these 
exercises whose primary purpose is In developing a proper and balanced body and skill, each part of the body has 
special exercises in order to avoid sudden sports injuries. (14: 69).  
Jantezin and Euler and Kelso (Jantzen, Oullier & Kelso, 2008) indicate that neuromuscular performance is a 
complex ability that requires good levels of other fitnes s components, such as balance, agility, and strength, and all 
activities and exercises share the need for a varying degree of coordination of movements and extent Its compatibility 
in the ever -changing environment, despite the complexity of the processes a ssociated with neuromuscular and synaptic 
compatibility, the human brain is able to easily integrate the information received through the sensory organs, muscles, 
and joints, thereby providing a wide range of adaptive behavior. In the mathematical field, t here is a need to understand, 
understand, and improve the behavioral and neurological mechanisms behind the performance. (13:335)  
Abdullah Hussain Al -Lami (2006) notes that muscular nervous performance is of great importance; This is because 
its development is one of the main goals of physical education, just as the importance of motor alignment is not limited 
to sports activity only , but extends to the general life of the individual, as all the requirements of public life require 
some degree of compatibility between different parts of the body, and neuromuscular performance is the ability The 
individual merges more than one movement using more than one part of his body in one frame, accurately, smoothly 
and high. (4:29)  
Neuromuscular performance plays an essential role effective in different human movements, so it is urgent because 
of its importance in performing sports skills in gen eral and swimming in particular for a smooth, consistent and 
economic performance in the effort and performance in general and reducing injuries in sports swimming in particular.  
Al-Mu'tasim Shatnawi (2006) states that sports injury science is one of the sciences interested in studying sports 
movement in times and conditions of different fixed conditions and animations, individual and group ability to 
anticipate injury before it occurs and determine its types and forms and patterns of injuries associated w ith the activity 
of a sports practitioner in order to work to protect the player from injury. (11: 167).  
Zakaria Hassan Shehata (2004) indicates that strong competition for important things that may lead to a rate that 
increases the likelihood of injury i s that lack of interest in a sufficient physical preparation to meet performance 
requirements and focus on technical and tactical aspects in order to achieve rapid goals and failure to provide protection 
to avoid injuries through Preparing preventive train ing programs to meet the continuous rapid development in technical 
performance and what it requires in terms of severity and size, which requires attention to physical fitness elements,

in avoiding injury and preventing and reducing them (4: 5).  
It is worth noting that Mahmoud Selim is lighter (2005), it is natural that the level of sports for any player affected 
by the injury, especially those  severe that prevent him mainly from playing the game naturally with the player remains 
on the situation for a long time despite the development of treatment methods and the development of The methods, 
theories, and devices used in this field. One of the t hings that affect the player is that the coach returns the player to 
participate in play before completing treatment periods, causing a repeated injury to him that affects his athletic level 
in general (8: 23).  
Hence the interest in this study was to reac h a better approach to preventing injuries  in swimming  sports  by 
identifying injuries and the extent of the  student’s  health information to avoid these injuries, believing that keeping the  
student  intact is one of the goals of playing sports while reducing  the incidence of injury from During the guidance and 
guidance of  female students  ,this is important to ensure continuity and participation in competitions and progress.   
Through  M observed a  researcher  for the  students of the  College of  the Physical Educa tion and Sports Science  in 
swimming  it found that  all the skills and that t the people of  the students  are the  result of the  work of a  single muscle 
or group of  muscle and sometimes calls it for  many muscle groups involvement depending on the amount of  force 
work type To be used physiologically, based on the type of energy used to contract and stretch the muscle  , and the 
participation of more than one muscle in a particular work does not mean that all of these muscles work in one direction 
or all share the  same amount, but the work of these muscles varies among them in terms of relative importance And 
the nature of the skillful work  ,which  requires a degree of compatibility between the nervous and muscular system, 
and the importance of muscular and nervous compatibility  among the  female students  in order to perform the different 
skills in swimming sport  through muscular nervous compatibility .   
Through note  researcher  for students  in the sport of  swimming  for a h J t repeat the existence of the  phenomenon 
of sports injuries and  fatigue and  muscle through the  low level of  performance they have  , which requires a  high 
degree of concentration and precision through the  amount of  common muscle performance and the  possibility of  
control and in different parts of th e body and the  inability to perform the  total time  of the  lectures  and increased injuries 
occurring muscle tension and tear muscular muscles and  lower private party muscles of the  previous background  , 
which called for the  researcher  to study the  developme nt of muscular performance nervous  in a to some extent of

There were statistically significant differences between the previous and posterior measurements of the 
experimental group in all harmonic variables under consideration and the improvement ratio in favor of posterior 
measurement since all the significance level values are less than the significance level (0.05).

deer with simple loads, which are appropriate for the sample and the performance o f many times and high efficiency 
with the progress of pregnancy in addition to the diversity and multiplicity of exercises that sponsor a researcher in the 
principles of design for the implementation of training and this reflected its impact on Improving i nteroperability.  
In this regard, Tony Reinus remembers Tony Ronolds "(2006) performing neuromuscular training functional ways 
to develop interoperability capabilities better than training freely as it was found that athletes have more accuracy when 
using here and can feel their inaccurate appointment and be adjusted and adjusted accordingly ( 16:19).  
These results coincide with what Matthew (2009) stated that through training he develops both the interoperability 
capabilities of players and then switches to general skills and then to the special skills of mathematical specialists, they 
create the nervous system to be ready and ready to stimulate the movement of units further because it The more muscle 
movement you use, the greater the force used during mus cle contraction. Strong muscle contraction leads to a great 
deal of speed, agility, and compatibility, which reflects its effect on developing the skill level and helps in finding an 
athlete with a high level of performance (11:15).  
Presenting and discuss ing the results, the second hypothesis "the presence of statistically significant differences" 
between the previous and subsequent measurements of the experimental group in reducing injuries in swimming sport 
for female students of physical education and s ports science in favor of posterior measurement.

It is clear from Table No. (9) Related to the frequency and incidence of (skin injuries) in swimming sport before 
and after the program, that the percentage of skin injuries with membranes in the previous measurement was 12.77%. 
In the posterior measuremen t, it reached 6.38%, the percentage of differences (6.39), and the rate of occurrence of skin 
injuries, wounds in the prior measurement reached 8.51%, and in the subsequent measurement, it reached zero%, with 
a difference (8.51).  
Despite the scientific pr ogress in the sports field in the last period of time, which is concerned with more security 
and safety for players through the development of procedures and methods used in training, learning and competition, 
the rates of injury are still high, which lead s to obstruction, the speed of access to the higher levels varies And rates of 
injury according to sports practice as it depends on the quality and sport of exercise and the availability of safety and 
security factors and the prevention of injuries during training or competitions.  
The researcher agreed with Usama Al -Riyadh (2000) and Abu Al -Ula Abdel -Fattah (2003) that injuries can be 
divided according to the degree of injury into minor injuries such as muscle contraction - menstruation - light palate - 
bruising and moderate -severe injuries such as non -torn fractures - muscle fatigue and other severe injuries like a 
fracture -dislocation - a wound accompanied by a fracture wound with dislocation. (3: 164) (1:32).  
It is clear from Table (6) (7) (8) (9) regar ding the frequency and incidence of (muscle injuries) in swimming sport 
before and after the program, that the incidence of muscle fatigue for obesity muscles in the initial measurement 
reached 14.89% and in the subsequent measurement 6.38%, with a differe nce (8.51), and the occurrence of a muscle 
strain injury in the anterior thigh muscles in the previous measurement 6.38%, and in the post measure it reached 
2.13%, a difference (4.26), and the muscle strain injuries of the back thigh muscles reached in the  previous 
measurement 8.51%, and in the dimensional measurement 4.26%, By a difference (4.26), and cases of muscle strain in 
the abdominal muscles in tribal measurements 4.26%, and in dimensional measurement zero% by a difference (4.26), 
and the occurrence  of muscle strain in the lower back muscles in tribal measurements 10.64% and in dimensions ionic 
measurement reached 6.38%, a difference ( 4.26), and the incidence of rupture muscles of obesity in the pre -
measurement 4.26%, and in the post -measurement rea ched 2.13%, a difference (2.13). The incidence of muscle tear in 
the anterior thigh muscles in the preoperative measurement was 2.13%, and the posterior measurement was zero%, 
with a difference (2.13). The rate of injury to the posterior femoral muscle tea r in the previous measurement was 
4.26% and in the posterior measurement it was zero% difference (4.26).

Through the research procedures and within the framework of the chosen sample and the results of the results, the 
researcher clarified the following conclusions:  
1. The program has a major impact on some harmonic capabilities in swimming sport for students o f the Faculty 
of Physical Education and Sports Science.  
2. Training in neuromuscular performance has a positive effect on reducing some of the most common swimming 
injuries for female students from the Faculty of Physical Education and Sports Science.  
RECOM MENDATIONS   
The researcher recommends through the previous results within the framework of the research sample and the 
procedures followed:  
1. Guidance on the neuromuscular performance program as one of the methods of preventing sports injuries 
common in swi mming among students of the Faculty of Physical Education and Sports Science.  
2. Increasing health awareness among students of the Faculty of Physical Education and Sports Science.  
3. Application of the program within the teaching curricula to prevent injuries  in swimming sport in the Faculty 
of Physical Education and Sports Science.  
4. Attention to placing neuromuscular performance programs within the general program, and not as a warmup 
period, as it has a significant impact on developing harmonic capabilities and reducing some injuries among 
students of the College of Physical Education and Sports Science.  
5. T. Guardian researcher to conduct similar studies on other dental stages.
