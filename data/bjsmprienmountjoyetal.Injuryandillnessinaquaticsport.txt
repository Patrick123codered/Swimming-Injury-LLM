Background Epidemiological information on injury/
illness is required to develop effective injury preventionstrategies.Aim To assess the frequency and characteristics of
injuries/illnesses (1) in the 4 weeks prior to and (2)during the Fédération Internationale de Natation (FINA)World Championships 2015 compared with 2013 and2009.Method (1) Athletes answered a retrospective
questionnaire, and (2) the medical staff reported injuries/illnesses prospectively during the championships.Results (1) A quarter of responding athletes reported
symptoms in the 4 weeks prior to the championships.More than half of all affected athletes presented withsubstantial severity, 80% took medication, 70% hadoveruse injuries and 30% did not modify their trainingregime despite symptoms. At the start of thechampionships, 70% of affected participants were stillsymptomatic. (2) During the championships, injury andillness incidence was 12.9 per 100 athletes. The mostcommon injuries were shoulder sprains (5.7%) and
muscle cramps of the lower back (5.7%). The most
common illnesses were infections of the respiratory(33.9%) and gastrointestinal tract (23.5%). Risk factorsincluded discipline and age, but not gender. Incidencewas highest in athletes competing in high diving (HD),water polo (WP) and diving (DIV) for injuries, and WPand swimming (SW) for illnesses. The signi ﬁcantly higher
incidence of injuries and illnesses at the FINA WorldChampionships 2015 compared with 2013 and 2009was most probably due to a similarly improved responserate of the medical staff.Conclusions In aquatic sports, surveillance and health
promotion should focus on prevention of out-of-competition overuse injuries and athlete education.
INTRODUCTION
Aquatic sport has the second largest athlete partici-
pation at the Olympic Games and enjoys globalpopularity throughout the lifespan. Governed bythe international swimming federation (FédérationInternationale de Natation, (FINA)), W orldChampionships are held biannually in six disci-plines: swimming (SW), diving (DIV), water polo(WP), synchronised swimming (SYN), open waterswimming (OWS) and high diving (HD). At theFINA W orld Championships 2015 in Kazan,Russia, 2413 athletes participated representing 186
countries.
While most literature on health in aquatic ath-
letes focuses on shoulder problems in SW and/or
uses retrospective research designs with smallsample sizes,
1some data from prospective studies
have become available in recent years.2–8During
the W orld Aquatic Championships 2009 and 2013,FINA implemented an injury and illness surveillanceprogramme to direct activities targeting athletehealth.
48Further, the International Olympic
Committee (IOC) assessed injury incidence in WPduring the 2004 Olympic Games,
2and investigated
all aquatic disciplines during the 2008 and 2012Olympic Games.
36Another prospective injury sur-
veillance programme that has rendered interestingresults was conducted by the National CollegiateAthletic Association in SWand DIV .
57
Results of the above-mentioned studies suggest
that the injury rate varies between aquatic disci-plines and is on average lower than in other sports.Junge et al
3and Engebretsen et al6reported an
incidence of 9.6/12.9 injuries per 100 athletesacross all Olympic disciplines and 4.4/7.6 injuriesper 100 athletes in aquatic sport in 2008/2012. Atthe FINA W orld Championships 2009 and 2013,incidence rates were 6.6 and 8.3 injuries per 100athletes; the highest injury rates were reported inDIV (12.6/100 athletes) and WP (15.3/100 ath-letes), respectively.
48While the most frequently
reported injury location is the shoulder, someauthors also note a high prevalence of head/handinjuries in WP ,
9knee pain in breast stroke SW10
and lower back problems in DIV .11
A striking percentage of injuries during aquatic
tournaments (27.4 –37.5%) was reported to be
caused by overuse.48In an effort to better under-
stand these overuse injuries, an athlete survey wasadded to the injury and illness surveillance protocolat the FINA W orld Championships in 2013.Mountjoy et al
8found that a third of all athletes suf-
fered from physical complaints in the 4 weeks priorto the championships, and 70% of these athleteswere still symptomatic at the start of the competition.
The primary aims of this study were to (1)
analyse the prevalence of injuries/illnesses in the4 weeks prior to the FINA W orld Championships2015 and (2) describe the incidence of injuries/ill-nesses during the FINA W orld Championships2015 compared with previous studies. A secondary

aim was the assessment of informational needs of the aquatic
athlete on different health-related topics.
METHODS
Study design
The study has two components: (1) a retrospective survey on
physical complaints prior to the championships and informationalneeds on health-related topics and (2) a prospective survey onnewly incurred injuries and illnesses during the championships.
Participants
The study population consisted of all 2413 athletes who com-peted at the FINA W orld Championships 2015 in one of the sixaquatic disciplines: SYN (n=339), WP (n=415), DIV (n=248),OWS (n=187), SW (n=1194) and HD (n=30). Overall, morefemale (n=1262) than male athletes (n=1151) participated andathlete age ranged from 10 to 40 years with an average of22.1 years (SD=4.5).
Materials
1. In the retrospective survey, athletes were asked to report
details on all health problems (location, type, cause, durationand severity) during the 4 weeks prior to and at the start ofthe championships. Health complaints were de ﬁned as any
physical or mental health disorder, regardless of the conse-quences for participation in training or competition. Healthproblems of substantial severity were de ﬁned as any physical
or mental health complaints that affected the athletes ’per-
formance or training regime at least moderately.
12Injuries
not caused by aquatic sport were excluded from the analysis.The questionnaire was identical to the one used in 2013,
8
but expanded by questions on the frequency of medicationuse, and the athletes’ interest in educational information on
different health-related topics ( table 2 ).
2. In the prospective survey, team physicians (TPs) and the
local organising committee (LOC) medical staff were askedto complete daily reports on all newly incurred injuries(onset, location, type, cause and time-loss) and illnesses(affected system, main symptoms, cause and time-loss). As inprevious projects,
48injuries were de ﬁned as any musculo-
skeletal complaints and/or concussion that received medicalattention regardless of the consequences for participation;illnesses were de ﬁned as any physical or mental health com-
plaints not related to injury that received medical attention.
Questionnaires and report forms could be completed elec-tronically or in pen and paper format and were available infour languages: English, French, Spanish and Russian.Supplemental materials included information booklets forathletes, TPs and LOC detailing the study and de ﬁnitions of
all important terminologies.
Procedures
For comparability of results, procedures were kept identical to
the ones employed at previous FINA W orld Championships.48
Prior to the event, information regarding the purpose and logis-tics of the study was sent to all National Federations, registeredTPs and LOC. At the start of the championships and at thebeginning of the second week, all materials were distributed atthe technical meetings of each discipline and the FINA NationalFederation Medical meeting. During the competitions, onemember of the study group was present at every event toencourage and assist with participation. Report forms ﬁlled in
by the LOC were collected regularly from all venues. Responserates and quality of data were analysed daily. Duplication ofdata entries was resolved by consensus of AJ and AP . Ethicalapproval was granted from McMaster University —Hamilton
Integrated Research Ethics Board, Canada.
Data analysis and presentation
All data were processed using SPSS (V .23, IBM) and Excel(Microsoft Of ﬁce 2010). Results are reported in accordance
with the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studiesin Epidemiology guidelines, and described using means with SDor frequencies with percentage. Incidence/prevalence rates werecalculated as number of injuries or illnesses per 100 athletes andreported with 95% CIs. In both parts of the study, the age,gender and competitive discipline were assessed as potential mod-erator variables. The χ
2and t-tests were used to compare inci-
dence/prevalence rates based on these moderators. Spearman ’s
rank-order correlation was run to determine the relationshipbetween items assessing informational needs. Signi ﬁcance was
accepted at p<0.05.
RESULTS
Retrospective survey on prior health problems andinformational needs
Response rate : Just over half (n=1244; 51.6%) of the 2413 ath-
letes representing 42% (n=78) of participating countries from
allﬁve continents completed the survey. This is comparable to
values reported in 2013. Response rates varied considerably bydiscipline, ranging from 38% in OWS to 87% in HD ( table 1 ).
No signi ﬁcant age or gender difference was observed between
respondents and non-respondents.
Health problems : Around a quarter (26.1%) of athletes
reported health complaints in the 4 weeks prior to the cham-
pionships; 19% of respondents suffered from injuries, 5% had
illnesses and 2% reported both. On average, affected athleteshad symptoms on 11 days during the previous 4 weeks, andalmost half (43.0%) had health problems of substantial severity.The median duration of prior complaints was 3 months, rangingfrom 3.5 days to 15 years. The average time-loss in training was2 days, and more than two-thirds (69.0%) of affected athletesmodi ﬁed their training regime. Conversely, one-third (31.0%) of
athletes did not modify their training regime despite complaints.Most injuries were caused by overuse (68.1%) and affected theshoulder (26.4%), knee (10.1%), lower back (9.8%) and hip/groin area (9.6%). The most common illnesses were respiratorytract infections (26.3%), gastrointestinal infections (13.7%) andotitis (13.7%). The 4-week prevalence of medication use in ath-letes with health problems was 81%; most athletes took painkil-lers (63.4%), followed by muscle relaxants (23.9%), sleepingpills (16.7%), cortisone (10.1%) and psychotropic drugs(7.3%). At the start of the championships, two-thirds (69.6%)of affected athletes were still symptomatic, and over half(55.3%) reported that their performance was affected.
The prevalence of prior complaints differed signi ﬁcantly
between disciplines ( χ
2=56.2; p<0.01), with 61.5% of high
divers and 51.6% of divers but only 20% of swimmers report-
ing prior complaints ( table 1 ). Athletes with health problems
were signi ﬁcantly older (M=23.0, SD=4.6) than participants
without health problems (M=22.3, SD=4.4; t=2.5; p<0.05).
No difference was found between male and female athletes.
Informational needs : Athletes were most interested in edu-
cational material about nutrition/hydration and nutritional sup-plementation as well as in prevention and treatment of injury(table 2 ). Between 32.4% and 39.9% felt fully informed about
the listed topics. All items were highly correlated (r
s=0.57 –
0.90, p<0.01).

Prospective survey during the championships
Athletes ’coverage and response rate : The TPs of 81 countries
(43.5%), representing all ﬁve continents, participated in the
study covering 1977 athletes (81.9%); a total of 1076 daily
report forms (response rate: 83.0%) were returned. Further, theLOC medical staff of all training/competition venues and the
athletes’ village ﬁlled in 80 daily report forms (response rate:
52.3%). Response rate and athlete coverage varied by discipline,
with response rates between 60% (SYN) and 91% (HD) and
athlete coverage between 64% (OWS) and 100% (WP).
Injuries : A total of 312 injuries were reported, of which a
quarter (n=63) resulted in time-loss. This represents an injury inci-dence of 12.9/100 athletes (95% CI±1.43) and time-loss injury
incidence of 2.6/100 athletes (95% CI±0.64). The most commoninjuries were shoulder sprains (5.7%), muscle cramps in thelumbar spine area (5.7%) and head contusions (4.7%). Around40% of all injuries were caused by overuse and a third (33.7%) bycontact with another athlete, an object or during water entry.
Incidence of all and time-loss injuries varied signi ﬁcantly
by discipline ( χ
2=84.1, p<0.01; χ2=26.1, p<0.01) and age
(t=6.38, p<0.01; t=4.97, p<0.01); however, no main ordiscipline-speci ﬁc gender effect could be observed. The highest
incidence of all and time-loss injuries was reported in HD fol-lowed by WP and DIV ( ﬁgure 1 A). Injured athletes were signi ﬁ-
cantly older (M=23.7, SD=4.4) than non-injured participants(M=21.9, SD=5.1); this difference was even more pronouncedwhen comparing athletes with (M=25.0, SD=5.3) and withouttime-loss injury (M=22.1, SD=4.4). Finally , signi ﬁcant differ-
ences between disciplines were found with regard to trainingand competition injury rates ( χ
2=47.4, p<0.01). In SYN
(73.9%) and SW (71.2%), more injuries were incurred in train-ing, while in WP (77.4%) and OWS (75.0%), more injurieswere incurred in competition; in HD and DIV , no signi ﬁcant dif-
ferences were found.
Illnesses : A total of 312 illnesses were reported, of which 36
(17%) resulted in time-loss. This is equivalent to an illness inci-dence of 12.9/100 athletes (95% CI±1.43) and time-loss illnessincidence of 1.5/100 athletes (95% CI±0.49). Most commonillnesses affected the respiratory tract (33.9%) or the gastrointes-tinal tract (23.5%) and were caused by infection (45.3%).

exposure (24.6%), resulting in otitis (9.6%) and allergy/skin
rash (9.0%).
Illness and time-loss illness incidence varied signi ﬁcantly by
discipline ( χ2=15.7, p<0.01; χ2=12.0, p<0.05) and age
(t=2.62, p<0.01; t=1.99, p<0.05), but not gender. HD hadthe highest illness incidence and WP the highest time-loss illnessincidence ( ﬁgure 1 B). Further, ill athletes were signi ﬁcantly
older (M=22.8, SD=4.4) than non-ill participants (M=21.9,SD=5.1); a similar age difference was found when comparingathletes with (M=23.7, SD=3.8) and without time-loss illnesses(M=22.1, SD=4.5).
Comparison with prospective surveys in previous
championships
Athletes ’coverage and response rate : There was a signi ﬁcant
increase in participating countries ( χ2=7.0, p<0.05), athlete
coverage ( χ2=146.7, p<0.01) and response rate ( χ2=428.3,
p<0.01) since the study was ﬁrst conducted ( table 3 ).48
Further, the compliance of the LOC medical staff has improved
as reﬂected in a higher percentage of LOC-reported injuries and
illnesses returned.
Injuries : The incidence of all reported injuries ( χ2=62.6,
p<0.01) and time-loss injuries ( χ2=26.2, p<0.01) has increased
progressively over the years ( table 3 ). In all three FINA W orld
Championships, the most commonly affected anatomical site
was the shoulder (15.0%, 22.1%, 19.2%), followed by the head(9.0%, 15.1%, 10.0%). The most common injury types weresprains (19.9%, 12.4%, 19.3%) and strains (15.7%, 16.3%,
14.8%). At the FINA W orld Championship 2013, there was alsoa high incidence of ﬁnger/thumb injuries (9.5%) and tendinosis
(16.3%). The most common injury causes were overuse (37.4%,27.4%, 41.7%) and traumatic contact (30.7%, 41.1%, 33.9%).When comparing aquatic disciplines particularly high injuryincidence rates were found consistently in DIV (16.0%, 11.4%,19.0%) and WP (10.2%, 15.3%, 23.1%). Results of the presentstudy also show a high injury incidence in HD (36.7%). Nogender differences were observed, except a higher injury risk infemale (7.1/100, 95% CI±1.46) compared with male athletes(4.8/100, 95% CI±1.19) at the FINA W orld Championships2009 ( table 3 ).
Illnesses : While illness incidence ( χ
2=50.5, p<0.01) has
increased signi ﬁcantly since the study was ﬁrst conducted, time-
loss illness incidence has not ( table 3 ). At all three champion-
ships, infections of the respiratory (32.6%, 24.7%, 34.3%) orthe gastrointestinal tract (20.4%, 23.2%, 23.7%) and otitis(17.1%, 15.5%, 9.6%) were most common. Consistently highillness incidence rates were reported in WP (6.3%, 8.2%,16.6%) and SW (8.5%, 8.9%, 13.5%); however, the highestillness incidence was found in HD in 2015 (16.7%) and inOWS in 2013 (21.6%). Illness rates did not differ based ongender ( table 3 ).

Championships 2015 and (2) describe the incidence of injuries/
illnesses during the FINA W orld Championships 2015 comparedwith previous studies.
Retrospective survey on prior health problems and
informational needs
Consistent with previous research, the retrospective athlete
survey showed that athletes continue to train and compete whileinjured or ill.
81 3On average, affected athletes suffered from
symptoms on 11 days during the 4 weeks prior to the cham-pionships; however, the mean absence from training was only2 days; one-third of athletes did not modify their trainingregime at all despite reporting complaints. This may contributeto the fact that two-thirds of athletes were still symptomatic atthe start of the championships and over half reported that theirperformance was affected.
In line with these ﬁndings, around 80% of athletes with com-
plaints used at least one medication in the 4 weeks prior to thechampionships; two-thirds of athletes took painkillers, a quartertook muscle relaxants and 17% used sleeping pills. Reportedprevalence rates for the use of any medication during inter-national football, athletics and multisport events range between35% and 69%; however, these rates relate to physicians ’reports
on all athletes.
14–17Several authors18 19have suggested that
excessive medication use is an issue in elite sport and may infact inhibit recovery after injury.
20 21Future studies should
evaluate medication use during aquatic championships in all ath-letes for comparison with data from other sports.
Extending our 2009 report,
4overuse was again the most
common cause of injury before (68.1%) and during (41.4%) theFINA W orld Championships 2015. Elite athletes continue totrain despite complaints and have a high prevalence of painmedication use.
8T o gather more information on overuse injuries
and minimise selection and recall biases inherent to the retro-spective design of the athlete survey, an expert committee has
recently recommended prospective out-of-competition surveil-
lance.
22Results of our study support this recommendation and
emphasise the need to develop effective overuse injury preven-tion and management strategies.
An e w ﬁnding with practical implications for the development
of such strategies is that age and discipline, but not gender, weresigniﬁcant moderators of injury and illness incidence. This
suggests that gender is not a risk factor for injury or illness inaquatic disciplines
578unlike in sports such as athletics23or
football,24where males have an overall increased injury inci-
dence. In aquatics, the high-risk group comprises older athletescompeting in HD, WP and DIV . The injury incidence andseverity pro ﬁle in HD was almost twice as high compared with
WP or DIV , and seven times higher than reported at the FINA
W orld Championships 2013, where this discipline was ﬁrst
introduced.
8However, this result needs to be interpreted cau-
tiously due to the relatively small sample sizes and large CIs.
More data are needed on the epidemiology of injury and illnessin HD for an effective risk management and improvement ofin-competition prevention protocols.
Prospective survey during the championships
Based on data collected in the prospective survey, it is apparentthat a sport-speci ﬁc approach to injury prevention focusing on
the identi ﬁed high-risk groups is required. Results indicate that
discipline acts as an important moderator for competition/train-ing injury incidence and injury cause, location and type. Whilethigh strains caused at water entry were most common in HD,overuse injuries of the shoulder and lower back were the mostprevalent issue in DIV , and shoulder and head problems causedby contact with another athlete in WP . The high incidence ofshoulder injuries across disciplines and the discipline-speci ﬁc
risk of head and lower back problems extend the ﬁndings of
previous literature.
791 1Further, in-competition injuries were
the main concern in WP and OWS, while in SW and SYN, mostinjuries occurred during training. W e hypothesise that these dif-ferences in training and competition injury rates by disciplineare due to great variation in training and competition exposure,as well as amount of in-competition contact.
How do the new data compare with previous prospective
surveys?
Comparison with previous prospective surveys at FINA W orld
Championships48showed an improved compliance and
response rate of TPs and LOC medical staff, and thus more
reported injuries and illnesses ( table 3 ). A similar trend was
observed at the Olympic Games.36However, the injury pro ﬁle
remained mostly consistent over the years; therefore, it is postu-lated that the increase in familiarity and thus compliance withthe study protocol is responsible for the observed increase ininjury and illness rates, rather than concluding that aquatic sportis becoming more dangerous. In a similar vein, results suggestthat surveillance protocols need to be implemented consistentlyover the course of several events in order to reach the compli-ance necessary to approximate the true injury and illness risk.
Finally, data collected on informational needs indicate that
athlete education should be another focus of future health pro-motion efforts.
25More than half of participants were interested
in information on almost half of all suggested health-relatedtopics, with nutrition and supplementation ranking highest.Considering that most international sport federations report tohave programmes, guidelines or research activities on nutrition/hydration,
26including the IOC27and FINA,28knowledge trans-
lation strategies need to be improved. Moreover, all items oninformational needs correlated signi ﬁcantly —that is, while ath-
letes were interested in health education, they were unable todifferentiate topics with respect to importance for their individ-ual requirements. T o the authors ’knowledge, this is a novel
ﬁnding. W e suggest that future studies evaluate informational
needs and existing health-related knowledge in elite athletes ofother sports for comparison with the present data.
Strengths and limitations
Strengths of this study include the high response rate andathlete coverage in the prospective survey. Further, by combin-ing different research designs through the implementation of aretrospective and a prospective survey, potential reporting biaseswere minimised, thus enhancing understanding.
29However, lim-
itations to the accuracy of data collected in the retrospectivesurvey exist. While we did employ a narrow recall period of4 weeks, there is still potential for recall bias. Moreover, athleteswith injuries that prevented them from travelling to the champion-ships were not captured in this study. Thus, the reported preva-lence and severity proﬁ le for the out-of-competition period is
most likely an underestimate of the actual values, and future pro-spective studies covering in-competition and out-of-competitionare highly recommended.
CONCLUSION
Epidemiological data from a single event are more prone tobias, especially when implementing a new surveillance system.Further, as our data show, compliance and participation hasimproved substantially over the years. The improved response

rate and associated increase in reporting of injury and illness
incidence underline the importance of implementing surveil-lance protocols consistently over the course of several events toapproximate true values. Further, age and discipline wereimportant moderators of injury and illness risk; overuse con-
tinues to be the main cause of injury prior to and during the
championships. These ﬁndings emphasise the need for effective
injury management and prevention strategies in aquatics. W erecommend (1) a sport-speci ﬁc approach to prevention, (2)
out-of-competition injury surveillance and (3) improving athletehealth education. T opics of particular interest with regard tohealth information were nutrition and nutritional supplementa-tion. Future studies should evaluate medication use duringaquatic tournaments in all athletes for comparison with data col-lected in other sports.
What are the ﬁndings?
▸Injury risk in the FINA World Championships 2015 was
signiﬁcantly higher than in 2013 and 2009; this was
attributed to better familiarity and thus increasedcompliance with the protocol.
▸Age and discipline, but not gender, were moderators for
injury and illness risk.
▸Of all athletes with complaints in the 4 weeks prior to the
championships, 30% did not modify their training regime,70% had overuse injuries and 80% used at least onemedication in this period.
▸The majority of athletes were interested in health education,particularly with regard to nutrition and supplements;however, current health knowledge seemed to be poor.
How might it impact on clinical practice in the future?
▸Given the injury and illness incidence, targeted healthpromotion based on the results of this study should continueto be a focus of FINA activities.
▸The continuous implementation of an injury and illnesssurveillance protocol at FINA World Championships isparamount to achieve high data quality.
▸An out-of-competition injury surveillance is recommended togather more information on causes and management ofoveruse injuries.
▸Future studies should focus on medication use of athletesduring the championships.
