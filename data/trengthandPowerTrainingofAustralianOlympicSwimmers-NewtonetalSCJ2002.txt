■Introduction
AN OPTIMAL LEVEL OF STRENGTH
and power is necessary for suc-cessful performance in manysports, and swimming is no ex-ception. To compete successfullyat the Olympic level, swimmersmust include a year-round resis-tance training program to main-tain or increase strength andpower and reduce injury risk.
The strength and conditioning
program at the Australian Insti-tute of Sport has two principal de-sign goals for the resistance train-ing programs for swimmers: ﬁrst,to develop strength and power tolevels appropriate for the particu-lar athlete, and second, to reduceinjury by addressing any muscleimbalances and preexisting condi-tions speciﬁc to the athlete. In re-cent years, the injury prevention
aspect has received increasing at-tention, principally because it en-ables the swimmer to undertakethe high-volume sessions pre-scribed by the coaches while lim-iting the occurrence of overuse in-juries and subsequent time out ofthe water. An emphasis is placedon shoulder joint stability andtrunk rotational strength, takingin elements of core stability andsegmental stabilization.
Performance Enhancement
Increasing sport-specific move-
ment strength and power is veryimportant for swimmers. The pro-gram should not be perceived ashaving the potential to produceexcessive muscle hypertrophy.Swimming coaches believe thatchanges in body shape will in-crease drag force and this will be
detrimental to swimming perfor-mance. This contention has notbeen supported or refuted by sci-entific research, but a priority ofthe strength and conditioning pro-gram is to work harmoniouslywith the coaches, and their opin-ions are taken into consideration.A program that has the potentialto produce an outcome that thecoach considers undesirable willbe rejected. The education of theswimming coach in this area isvital. In truth, the athletes do nothave the time to devote to a resis-tance training program with suffi-cient volume to produce large in-creases in muscle size since theycomplete so many hours trainingin the pool. It is very unlikely thatmore than modest gains in musclesize could be achieved in these
8 Strength and Conditioning Journal June 2002athletes regardless of the resis-
tance training program. The largevolume of endurance exercise thatswimmers complete each week isincompatible with maximal gainsin strength and muscle size, andpast research (6) suggests theseconflicting influences will limitmuscle hypertrophy. In fact, animportant goal of the strength pro-gram is to maintain muscle size inan effort to counteract the highvolumes of pool training. 
Based on the research, it is
clear that athletes can produce in-creases in strength and power in re-sponse to appropriate resistancetraining without a gain in musclesize (11). These improvements instrength and power can be attrib-uted to an increase in the ability torecruit and synchronize the ﬁring of
their motor units (11) as well aschanges in intracellular factorssuch as myosin heavy chain com-position and enzyme activity (1, 3).Consideration of these adaptationsand the manipulation of programvariables form the basis of astrength and conditioning programfor swimming. The majority ofswimmers within this program donot need a hypertrophy type of pro-gram, but there are certain timeswhere muscular size increases arerequired. For example, it may be
difficult to realize increases instrength and power for an athletewith very low muscle mass. Femaleswimmers especially can be in needof carrying more muscular size inthe upper body. Although increas-es may occur due to neural and in-tracellular adaptations, these in-creases may be greatly enhancedwith prior increases in muscle size.What the optimal level of musclesize is for such gains is not knownfor the sport of swimming. 
Speciﬁc training for muscular
endurance, a critical componentof swimming performance, neednot be a part of a strength andconditioning program for swim-
ming. Rather, the strategy is to getthe athletes stronger and morepowerful and leave the develop-ment of muscular endurance forthe in-water training. Differentmethods of training to producethis effect are programmed by theswim coaches themselves and canrange from kick sessions to justarm-pull sessions. If maximalstrength and power are increased,then a given submaximal musclecontraction will be at a lower rela-tive intensity, and enduranceshould be increased once the ath-lete has expressed their increasedstrength and power in the pool.Core stability also plays a vital rolein the swimmer’s preparation be-cause the swimmer has to stabi-lize the trunk to produce forcewith the upper and lower limbs.
Although there is no empirical
data to support this, the coachand athlete should be made awarethat, upon initiating a resistancetraining program, there might bedeclines in skill performance dueto fatigue and muscle breakdown.This effect should quickly dissi-pate if it occurs at all. Researchhas shown that increasing musclestrength may initially result in adecrease in performance of thetarget skill (2). The athlete willhave to modify the control of theneuromuscular system, common-ly referred to as coordination, tim-ing, or technique, to actually pro-duce an increase in in-waterperformance. In order to take fullbenefit of an increase in musclestrength, coordination needs to be
adapted, which has been termed“tuning.” This is not a problem inswimming because musclestrength training programs are al-ways accompanied by consider-able swimming training, which al-lows the athletes to practice withtheir changed muscles. In addi-tion, strength endurance is notemphasized in the resistancetraining programs for swimmersbecause they already complete anenormous volume of swimmingand overuse and overtraining syn-dromes are always a risk. 
It is in the weight room where
improvements in an athlete’sstrength and power are predomi-nately generated. An appropriateprogram incorporating the correctexercises can improve the in-waterresults attainable from strength
and power training. The programswritten are straightforward andare the same for both male and fe-male swimmers. Individual varia-tion occurs when an injury issueis identified or musculoskeletalscreening has identiﬁed a muscleimbalance. Different swimmingstroke specialties (i.e., freestyle,backstroke, butterﬂy, and breast-stroke) have different exercises as-sociated with them. 
Injury Reduction
Shoulder girdle etiologies are one
of the most prominent injuries aswimmer encounters (4, 10). Themain cause of the shoulder injuryis overuse. Tendonitis mainly oc-curs in the swimmer’s rotator cuff

and usually can be addressed by
increasing the strength of the ex-ternal rotator muscles and thestabilizing muscles around thescapula (13). 
The cause of the inﬂammation
or tenderness around the rotatorcuff is typically the large volume oftraining, with some days amount-
ing to over 14 km being swum.This results in considerable inter-nal rotation strength and thus arelative weakness in the external
rotators. The muscle imbalance
combined with overuse makesshoulder injury a common maladyof swimmers. Some studies have
shown that this is more prevalentin butterfly and freestyle swim-mers than in backstroke andbreast stroke swimmers (5) due tothe pull-through phase of thesestrokes causing significant im-pingement. This difference has
10 Strength and Conditioning Journal June 2002been identiﬁed and programmed for correction. This
is accomplished regardless of their specialty stroke be-cause a large percentage of the high volume of trainingis done in freestyle mode. Therefore, all of the swim-mers are put on remedial exercises to prevent an in-jury occurring or developing a major imbalance thatwill eventually cause injury.

c■Designing A Program 
When designing a resistance training program for
competitive swimmers the following must be consid-ered:
•Goal of the program—hypertrophy, maximum
strength, maximum power, strength endurance.
•Number of reps—depends on goals (see Table 1).
•Number of sets—depends on goals (see Table 1).
•Rest between sets—depends on goals (see Table 1).
•Choice of exercise.
•Order of exercise.
All of the above will depend on the equipment
available, number of athletes in the weight room, andthe training age of the athlete. The goals of the pro-gram change throughout the year as the athletes getcloser to major competitions. The focus of macrocyclesshifts from strength to power and endurance as thecompetition draws closer.
It is necessary to adjust the repetition range and
number of sets required to produce adaptations ineach muscular quality. Problems have occurred in thepast when the incorrect repetition range has been pre-scribed. For example, a program designed to increasemuscular endurance in swimmers that involves using10 repetitions per set would not be the most appro-priate to achieve this goal. This type of training willpredominantly increase the lean muscle mass of theathlete, a hypertrophy training effect. Another mistake
June 2002 Strength and Conditioning Journal 11by many swim coaches is to pre-
scribe sets of 8–12 repetitions, as-suming they are building astrength base when in fact theyare inducing a body building ef-fect. As discussed previously, hy-pertrophy training may only be re-quired when a swimmer of slightbuild requires extra muscle mass.At this time, it might be prudent tolimit endurance activity and insti-gate a phase with the principlegoal of maximizing the hyper-trophic response. Given the con-ﬂicting requirements of the swim-ming coach for in-water training,this situation might be difficult toachieve. 
The success of any resistance
program depends on the accurateidentification of muscle groupsand joint actions used in thesport. To determine which exer-cises will be of beneﬁt to the swim-mer, a qualitative biomechanicalanalysis of each stroke includes
1. Joint actions.
2. Muscles recruited.3.Contraction mode—the type(concentric, eccentric, isomet-
ric) and speed of contraction.
4.Strength quality required—
maximum strength, rapidforce development, maximalpower (9).
The exercise that is most spe-
cific to the target movement willbe the best exercise to select be-cause of the greater carryover ef-fect to improved in-water perfor-mance. Using this method,several core exercises are chosenand written into the program.Other exercises are selected forthe program on the followingbases:
•Prevent muscle imbalances
developing between primemovers and antagonists.
•Prevent injury to prone areas
such as the shoulder.
•Increase core stability and
thus gain greater trunk rota-tional strength.
•Provide variety.
•Suit the skill level of the ath-
lete.In the past, many programs
have only concentrated on specif-ic movement patterns and musclegroups involved in swimming in-stead of first building a generalstrength base from a wide range ofoverall body exercises. It has beenwell documented that the use ofresistance training has produced
changes in bone (7) and connec-tive tissue density (8). This is veryimportant for the swim athletesbecause they spend a large part oftheir day in a non–load-bearingstate during normal training.Thus, to prevent “dry land” in-juries, establishing a generalstrength base through resistancetraining is an important injury-prevention method.
There are many methods that
are used to organize the exerciseswithin a given training session.Some of the more practical meth-ods are
•Exercises progressing from
large to small muscle groups.
•Alternating upper and lower
body exercises.

■Sample Programs
The ﬁrst program (Table 2) is de-
signed as an introductory pro-gram for the start of the swimmingyear. The goal of this program is toincrease the strength in the swim-mers’ shoulders while also tryingto increase their general strengthlevel (Figures 1 and 2).
The next program (Table 3)
was designed for Olympic medal-list Justin Norris. The emphasis ofthis program is to provide theswimmer with a good strengthbase to enable him to carry outthe volume of training. Justin didnot have a large resistance train-ing background. The program isdesigned to increase his strengthin the shoulder girdle and to sta-bilize his pelvic trunk area. Justinsuffers from strong internal rota-tors of the shoulder with weak ex-ternal rotators. Justin also needsstrength in his kick and better tri-ceps strength. The next program (Table 4)
was designed for Petria Thomas, asprint butterﬂy swimmer. The em-phasis of this program is twofold.Petria has very mobile joints, andas such, it is an important goal ofthe resistance training program toincrease the stability in her shoul-ders while also emphasizing thedevelopment of strength. Hereagain, we have the dual emphasisof performance enhancement aswell as injury prevention/rehabil-itation.
In a periodized progression,
the training program will changebefore a swim meet to emphasizeneural activation. This is designedto help swimmers in the taperprocess to be more coordinatedand be able to deliver forces wherethey need it. Samples of these pro-grams are not included becausegood coaching communication isneeded and technical feedback anecessity for results to beachieved.
■Summary
We do not live in an ideal world,
and the strength and conditioningspecialist working with the swim-
ming athlete must contend with awide range of competing and con-flicting factors. It is vital that allswimmers resistance train to in-crease strength and power for im-proved swimming performanceand to provide adequate strengthfor them to cope with the rigors ofhigh volumes of in-water training.The program must address anymuscle imbalances or prior in-juries to assist the athlete to re-main pain and injury free.  ▲
