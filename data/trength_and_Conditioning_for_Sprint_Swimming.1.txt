INTRODUCTION
Strength and conditioning (S&C) is
an essential aspect of performance
enhancement for sprint swimmingand is often used as a complimentary
training modality to in-pool condition-
ing. Swimming has unique demands as
a sport, but weight-room training can
offer considerable beneﬁts to comple-
ment the swimmer’s performance.
There are a number of issues relating to
swimming that the S&C coach must take
into consideration. Rasulbekov et al. (18)
suggested that the drag of the water
acts as a natural decelerator, increasing
the likelihood of tur bulence (unwanted
side-to-side movement during stroke pat-
tern). In addition, efﬁcient stroke pattern,
eradicating muscle imbalances, and sufﬁ-
cient agonist versus antagonist strength
ratios should also be considered before
embarking on program design (12–14).
However, more recent research has sug-
gested that the S&C coach is most likely
to make their greatest contribution by
inﬂuencing the moments the swimmer
has access to ground reaction forces
(GRFs), namely the dive and turn (4).
Therefore, the aim of this article will
focus on the importance of the start
and turn and the associated physical
components that enhance swimming
performance. The example training pro-
grams are aimed at enhancing perfor-
mance for the sprint swimmer.
IMPORTANCE OF S&C FOR
STARTS AND TURNS
This section will provide the reader
with an insight into existing literatureconcerning training strategies used to
enhance start/dive performance. Lyttle
and Benjanuvatra (11) (Table 1) identiﬁed
that a strong start can account for 30% of
a 50-m race and suggest that a strong
dive is essential to maximize perfor-
mance. The time spent on the blocks
to produce that force was measured at
0.79 second (10), highlighting the need
for both strength and power (including
rate of force development [RFD]).
Bishop et al. (2) assessed the effects of
plyometric training on block start perfor-
mance. The intervention consisted of 2
individual hour-long sessions using
a wide range of exercises starting with
low-intensity plyometrics, such as
ankling, progressing onto countermove-
ment jumps (CMJs), and squat jumps
(SJs), and ﬁnishing with a variety of drop
jump variations. Eight weeks of plyomet-
ric training provided a mean reduction of
0.59 second in start time, translating to
a signiﬁcant improvement in start perfor-
mance. Not only did the swimmers show
a reduction in time but also an increase in
the distance covered from when the
head contacted the water.
Poole and Maneval (16) investigated
the effects of 10 weeks of depth jump

training and its effects on vertical jump
performance. Forty depth jumps were
performed either 2 or 3 times a week.
The results demonstrated signiﬁcant
improvements in jump height for both
protocols but also identiﬁed that there
was no signiﬁcant difference between
2- or 3-day training protocols. West
et al. (24) looked at strength and power
predictors of starts in international
sprint swimmers and their correlation
with 15 m time, peak vertical and hor-
izontal force (Table 2). They found sig-
niﬁcant correlations between the 1
repetition maximum (1RM) back
squat, peak power, and jump height
(all speciﬁc to producing high GRFs).
They concluded that to improve swim
start performance, strength and power
exercises should be incorporated into
the programming.
In addition to the evidence presented
above, the S&C coach should be aware
of the different starts available to theswimming athlete. Holthe and
McClean (6) and Lee et al. (10) studied
biomechanical analyses of 2 differing
starts using 2 digital high speed cam-
eras identifying block start time, ﬂight
time, water angle entry, and time to
12 m. Both studies identiﬁed that the
track (split stance) start was superior,
allowing the athletes to dive further
with an increase in water entry speed.
Speciﬁcally, mean time spent on the
blocks for the track start was 0.79 sec-
ond, which was a signiﬁcant improve-
ment from the 0.84 second spent on
the blocks for the grab start. This trans-
lated to quicker take-off velocity (4.32
versus 4.2m/s), greater entry velocity
(5.31 versus 5.24 m/s), higher water
angle entry (40.9 versus 37.6 8), and
reduced time to the 12 m distance
(5.45 versus 5.53 seconds) (10). In light
of the evidence presented regarding
plyometrics and its effects on the start,
the differences between the track and
grab start may provide the S&C coach
with useful insight into sport-speciﬁc
exercises to assist with this aspect of
the race. Figure 1A and 1B depicts both
the grab and track starts, respectively,
that Lee et al. (10) assessed.
The turn is the second point during
races that provides the athlete with
GRFs. It may be noted that in
a 50-m long course race, there will be
no turn, as opposed to a single turn in
a 50-m short course race. Potdevin
et al. (17) identiﬁed that time spent
on the wall for swimmers during the
turn was between 0.3 and 0.5 seconds
and represented 1.5% of the total race
time in a 50-m event. The positions
adopted by the swimmers during theturn, as they apply GRF, are similar to
that of a CMJ. One may speculate that
much like the dive, improvement here
can be made by incorporating plyo-
metric training. The simulated pattern
of a CMJ is what the swimmers seem
to perform, and therefore, variations of
this exercise may help to produce
greater push-off distances.
Chow et al. (3) analyzed the turning tech-
niques of 19 elite swimmers. It was noted
that the average speed on approach to
the wall was greater in shorter distances,
as represented by 1.67 m/s covered in the
100-m events compared with 1.49 m/s in
t h e4 0 0 - me v e n t s .T h ed i s t a n c ec o v e r e d
from push off decreased as race distance
increased as well. The 100-m event por-
trayed push off distances of 5.07 m in
comparison with 4.71 m in the 400-m
event (3). The explanation for this
decrease in push-off distance was logi-
cally suspected to be down to a less force-
ful thrust, which was deemed an
indication of energy consumption for
the longer distances.
Theoretically, the S&C coach would
also address the physiological issues
associated with the sport/event in
question. However, the physiology of
swimming, although important, would
seem not to affect the methods for
enhancing the start or turn. Therefore,
this section can be described as falling
out of the remit of the S&C coach.

and are therefore deemed the most
appropriate power tests for sprint
swimmers (3,4,6,9,17). With the split
stance of the track start in mind (6),
imbalances in lower limb strength
and power may exist in swimmers;
therefore, single-leg jump tests (in
addition to 2-legged SJ and CMJ tests)
could provide some useful information
here regarding lower limb asymmetry.
Large differences will assist the S&C
coach with tailored program design
speciﬁc to the athlete.
LOWER BODY STRENGTH
West et al. (24) found that the 1RM
back squat was signiﬁcantly corre-
lated with time to 15 m, peak vertical
force, and peak horizontal force.
Rodeo (20) also identiﬁed the domi-
nant use of the glute complex and
quadriceps group during the majority
of phases in the breaststroke, which
would support the notion that the
1RM back squat test may be the most
appropriate.UPPER BODY STRENGTH
The breaststroke has unique demands
in comparison to the other 3 strokes.
Freestyle, backstroke, and butterﬂy
strokes require much greater mobility
and range of motion because of the
high demand for rotation in the shoul-
der joint. Although still prominent,
Rodeo’s kinesiological analysis (20)
stated that shoulder protraction,
adduction, and abduction were more
associated with the breaststroke. Nuber
et al. (15) provided supporting evi-
dence to the notion of less rotational
requirement in the breaststroke. A ﬁne
wire electromyographical analysis of
the muscles used in and around the
shoulder during freestyle, breaststroke,
and butterﬂy strokes was analyzed.
The 8 muscles analyzed were biceps,
subscapularis, latissimus dorsi, pector-
alis major, supraspinatus, infraspinatus,
serratus anterior, and deltoid. The
results suggested that the freestyle
and butterﬂy are frequently associated
with impingement syndrome becauseof the repetitive nature of rotation, but
this did not apply to the breaststroke.
What was of note was that the latissi-
mus dorsi and pectoralis major were
described as the “pull-through muscles,”
indicating their importance in the
“effort” phase of the stroke, whereas,
supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and serra-
tus anterior were predominantly “recov-
ery phase” muscles (15). This may
suggest that both push and pull tests
would be necessary for the breaststroke
swimmer. The current gold standard
ﬁeld tests to measure upper body
strength are the 1RM bench press and
1RM pull-up. It is important to check
the ratio between these, as appropriate
levels may optimize movement accu-
racy throughout the stroke, potentially
reducing the drag effect. In support,
this balance ratio is associated with
increased power (1), limb speed, and
movement accuracy (7). It is important
to note that the majority of force (from
the upper body) being applied comes
from the back muscles (15). Excessive

training of the chest muscle group could
be counter-productive as these muscles
are effectively producing force in the
wrong direction. Table 3 shows a pro-
posed testing battery for the sprint
swimmer.
INJURY ANALYSIS
LOWER BODY
Throughout the 2003–2004 National
Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA)
college season, Grote et al. (5) recorded
the results from a survey sent out by
Stanford University to the top 25
NCAA teams in that season. Two
hundred and ninety-six competitive
swimmers (198 male and 98 female
swimmers) provided feedback regarding
hip adductor injuries they experienced
that academic year. The male breast-
stroke swimmers swam a mean distance
of 9,017 67,162 m per week in compar-
ison with the individual medley swim-
mers who swam 5,853 61,961 m
(breaststroke) per week. Grote et al.
(5) noted that during the ﬁnal phase
of the breaststroke kick, peak adduction
velocity of the femur can reach 245 8per
second, thus offering an explanation as
to the vulnerability of the hip adductor
complex during the breaststroke. The
hip adductor injuries experienced by
breaststroke competitors in this season
was signiﬁcantly higher than individual
medley or nonbreaststroke swimmers.
These results are shown in Table 4.Literature on swimming has also
shown the knee joint to be at risk
of injury in addition to the hip adduc-
tor complex. Previous research by
Keskinen et al. (8) acknowledged
that a combination of high angular
velocities and excessive tibial external
rotation relative to the femur was a sig-
niﬁcant contributor to overuse move-
ment patterns in hip adduction and the
knee joint. Stulberg et al. (22) and
Rovere and Nichols (21) addressed
the associated risk factors and treat-
ment of the breaststroker’s knee and
identiﬁed that patella-femoral osteoar-
thritis was a prominent by-product of
the breaststroke kick and reduced
internal rotation of the hip. It was sug-
gested that the treatment should
involve working on technical aspects
of the breaststroke kick (21,22). For
the S&C coach, ensuring the hip
adductors can work dynamically in
a full range of motion would seem an
important part of program design to
compliment this aspect of the breast-
stroke kick. That said an exercise
such as lateral lunges would provide
good use of gluteal activation on one
side while simultaneously offering
ﬂexibility to the opposing adductor
complex.
UPPER BODY
Richardson et al. (19) studied the shoul-
der in competitive swimming at U.S.
training camps leading up to an Olympic
Games. It was reported that shoulder
pain was the most common injury in
competitive swimming. In addition, the
severity of the problem was claimed to
increase with the caliber of the athleteand be more associated with sprint
events as opposed to distance swimming
(19). During the freestyle, Richardson
et al. (19) reported that a common trait
among swimmer is for their elbows to
“drop” when fatigued. This causes
increased external rotation of the shoul-
der joint during the “pull-through” phase
of the stroke, which is deemed to cause
a mechanical disadvantage. Training the
adductors of the shoulder and internal
rotators is thought to assist in the pre-
vention of this common ﬂaw in tech-
nique (19) and thus may assist in the
strength and stability of the joint.
Wolf et al. (25) addressed injury pat-
terns in NCAA Division 1 swimmers
from 2002 to 2007 at the University of
Iowa. It was suggested that the highest
injury incidence was reported in the
freestyle but that this may have been
because of it being the most common
stroke swam. Fifty of 94 swimmers
swam freestyle, with 58% reporting
injuries throughout this period. The
highest injury percentage (90%)
occurred in the breaststroke but only
10 swimmers from this stroke took
part in this study. It was also suggested
that there was no signiﬁcant associa-
tion of stroke swam and time missed,
or body part injured. However, Wolf
et al. (25) did report that the shoulder
and upper arm were the most com-
m o ni n j u r ys i t ew i t h7 8o f9 4s w i m -
mers reporting injuries and time off
from training.

coach may be able to use to enhance
performance for various components
of a race. To speciﬁcally target the
start, plyometric exercises, such as
split broad jumps or split SJ (exercises
that work on improving both horizon-
tal and vertical power), would be
appropriate for complimenting the
s p l i ts t a n c es e e ni nt h et r a c ks t a r t .
However, the countermovement associ-
ated with the turn would imply that
plyometric exercises, such as CMJs
and drop jumps, may be a more appro-
priate training method for this section of
the race. In addition, the requirement for
high levels of RFD (for the start) would
support the notion for weightlifting,
namely the clean & jerk and snatch.
Both weightlifting and plyometric train-
ing are believed to be a very viable train-
ing method for enhancing both the start
and the turn. Before the Olympic-style
lifts can be taught safely and effectively,there is a requirement for a large foun-
dation of strength training to be under-
taken (23).
With respect to the lower body, lifts
such as the back squat and deadlift
will provide the necessary foundation
for developing the gluteal complex
and quadriceps in preparation for
progressing on to weightlifting. Lifts
that support upper body develop-
ment should include push presses,
bent-over rows, and pull-ups. Collec-
t i v e l y ,t h e s el i f t sw i l lp r o m o t eh i g h e r
GRFs and upper body postural
strength, providing a solid base for
progressing onto higher velocity
lifts/movement patterns, such as
weightlifting and plyometrics. Table 5
provides example strength and power
programs that the S&C coach may
consider for enhancing swimming
performance.CONCLUSION
The basis of dry-land training should
be centered around symmetry and
aiming to enhance strength and
power to improve performance for
the dive and turn. Existing research
has demonstrated that plyometric
training has proven to be a viable
training method for enhancing both
these aspects of a race. For strength
training, developing lower body
strength through exercises such as
back squats has also been shown to
have positive results on start perfor-
mance. Strengthening the adductor
complex must also be considered
in program design for injury preven-
tion purposes. Exercises such as lateral
lunges will not only offer the adductor
complex strength but also simulta-
neously increase their range of motion.
Because of the nature of having no real
“off-season”, periodization for swim-
ming can be considered a challenge.
That said concurrent training for
strength and power may be the most
appropriate forms of training to maxi-
mize performance.
