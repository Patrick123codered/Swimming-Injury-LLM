Context: Shoulder pain is the main cause of missed or
modified training in competitive swimmers. Shoulder musculo-
skeletal maladaptations occur to some extent as a consequence
of training loads during swimming that may increase the risk ofshoulder injury. Further evidence is needed to understand thetraining intensities at which these maladaptations occur.
Objective: To determine the acute effect of training intensity
on the shoulder musculoskeletal physical qualities associatedwith shoulder injury in competitive swimmers.
Design: Cross-sectional study.
Setting: Indoor swimming pool.
Patients or Other Participants: Sixteen asymptomatic
national- and regional-level swimmers (7 females, 9 males;
age¼14.663.9 years, height ¼160.5 612.7 cm, mass ¼55.3
612.5 kg).
Main Outcome Measure(s): Bilateral active shoulder-rota-
tion range of motion (ROM), joint position sense, latissimus dorsi
length, combined elevation test, and shoulder-rotation isometric
peak torque and handgrip peak force normalized to body weightwere measured before and immediately after low- and high-intensity swim-training sessions. The intensity of the sessions
was determined by the distance swum over or at the pacethreshold and confirmed by the swimmer’s rating of perceived
exertion.
Results: After the high-intensity training session, shoulder
external-rotation ROM (dominant side: P,.001, change ¼
/C07.88;d¼1.10; nondominant side: P¼.002, change ¼/C06.58,d¼
1.02), internal-rotator isometric peak torque (dominant side: P,
.001, change ¼/C011.4%, d ¼0.42; nondominant side: P¼.03,
change ¼/C06.6%, d ¼0.20), and external-rotator isometric peak
torque (dominant side: P¼.004, change ¼/C08.7%, d ¼0.27;
nondominant side: P¼.02, change ¼/C07.6%, d ¼0.25) were
reduced. No changes were found in any of the outcomemeasures after the low-intensity session.
Conclusions: Shoulder active external-rotation ROM and
rotation isometric peak torque were decreased immediately after
a high-intensity training session, possibly increasing the risk of
injury during subsequent training. Monitoring these variablesmay help practitioners adjust and manage training loads todecrease the risk of shoulder injury.

Key Points
/C15The intensity of the swim-training session, which can be easily measured using the rating of perceived exertion, may
be an important factor that can lead to maladaptive changes in the physical qualities of the shoulder.
/C15Active shoulder external-rotation range of motion and rotation isometric peak torque were immediately decreasedafter a high-intensity but not after a low-intensity training session, with predominant changes on the dominant side.
/C15Maladaptive changes in the physical qualities of the shoulder after a high-intensity training session probablyincrease the risk of shoulder injury during the training that follows.
The shoulder is the most commonly injured body part
in swimmers, accounting for 31% to 39% of allinjuries.
1,2This might be explained by the fact that
90% of the propulsive forces during swimming are
generated by the upper limbs.3In addition, competitive
swimmers swim approximately 10 000 to 14 000 m/day 6 or7 times per week.
3This amount of training volume
combined with the repetitive nature of the sport predisposesathletes to many shoulder overuse injuries.
1,2The preva-
lence of shoulder pain in competitive swimmers has been
reported to be between 26% and 91%.4–6Despite this high
prevalence, most swimmers do not discontinue trainingbecause of shoulder pain.
4This is reﬂected in the low
amount of time loss from training and competition reported
as a consequence of shoulder concerns.2,5Therefore,
shoulder pain might interfere with training and competitionperformance, leading to the development of chronic injuries
and in some cases to retirement from sport participation.4
The cause of musculoskeletal injuries in sport is dynamic
and multifactorial.7Emerging evidence8has indicated that
inadequate management of training loads is a major riskfactor for injury. In their workload-injury etiology model,Windt and Gabbett
9suggested that the risk of injury
changes dynamically as a result of the training loads
applied and their effects on modiﬁable risk factors.
Training loads can cause positive physiological adaptations(eg, ﬁtness) that alter modiﬁable risk factors positively,decreasing the risk of injury. However, training loads canalso cause negative physiological effects (eg, fatigue),altering modiﬁable risk factors and increasing the injuryrisk during subsequent training.
9The authors suggested the
importance of understanding the interactions between

training loads and modiﬁable risk factors for decreasing the
risk of injury.9This is supported by the complex-systems
approach to sports injuries proposed by Bittencourt et al,7
who emphasized understanding the interactions among riskfactors so as to identify injury risk proﬁles of an athlete orgroup of athletes. Several potential modiﬁable risk factorsfor shoulder pain, such as alterations in the physicalqualities of the shoulder (eg, range of motion [ROM],ﬂexibility, and strength), have been identiﬁed in swimmers.Regarding ROM and ﬂexibility, reduced internal-rotation(IR) ROM,
6increased10,11and decreased external-rotation
(ER) ROM,11reduced latissimus dorsi (LD) length,6and
reduced pectoralis minor length6have been reported.
Furthermore, reduced shoulder internal-rotator force6,12
and external-rotator endurance13have been found in
swimmers with shoulder pain.
Other physical qualities, such as shoulder joint position
sense (JPS), results of the combined elevation test (CET),and handgrip force (HGF), are also considered importantwhen clinicians examine swimmers. Although these havenot been reported as risk factors for shoulder pain in thispopulation, they are regularly used in clinical practice.Joint position sense is a submodality of proprioception and
is deﬁned as the ability to consciously recognize theposition of a joint in space.
14Proprioception is essential for
the practice of sport-related activities, providing neuro-muscular control and joint stability.
14The CET is a
screening tool used to assess the strength and mobility ofthe upper limb and thoracic spine.
15The movement
performed during the CET is essential for achieving a highelbow position during a swimming stroke.
15This is
important, because a dropped elbow has been suggested
as a sign of potential shoulder injury.3Finally, the HGF
provides an objective indicator of the functional status ofthe upper limb and has also been proposed as an indirectassessment of posterior cuff function.
16Considering that
training intensity is an important component of trainingloads,
9it is important to understand the effects of training
intensity on these physical qualities.
To date, the effect of swim-training loads on the physical
qualities of the shoulder in competitive swimmers has beeninvestigated in only 2 studies.
17,18Matthews et al18found a
bilateral decrease in ER ROM and an increase in JPS errorin the dominant extremity after swim training in 17 nationalyouth swimmers. In a later study, Higson et al
17observed
reduced ER ROM and pectoralis minor length andincreased JPS errors after swim training in 16 elite
swimmers. Based on the current evidence, shoulder
maladaptation occurs immediately after swim training,which may increase the risk of shoulder injury. However,these researchers measured the effect of only 1 type oftraining and, thus, only 1 training intensity. No one hasinvestigated the effect of different training intensities on thephysical qualities of the shoulder. Understanding how thephysical qualities of the shoulder are affected by trainingintensity could help inform researchers and clinicians onthe appropriate management of training loads. The aim ofappropriate load management is to maximize adaptationand performance while minimizing the risk of injury.
8This
includes adequate prescription, monitoring, and adjustmentof training loads.
8Our study may provide information
about which physical qualities need to be monitored.Monitoring might help to inform researchers on theappropriate timing of high-intensity training for enhancing
load capacity and performance without increasing thedetrimental effects on these physical qualities. It may also
help to identify postswim deﬁcits and permit early
interventions to reduce the susceptibility to shoulder injury.
Furthermore, considering the multifactorial nature of sport
injuries, assessment of more physical qualities is needed tosupport the current ﬁndings. To our knowledge, no authors
have addressed the effect of training loads on LD length,
CET, and HGF in swimmers. Therefore, the aim of our
study was to determine the acute effect of training intensity
on the musculoskeletal physical qualities associated withshoulder injury in competitive swimmers.
METHODS
Participants
We conducted this cross-sectional study among a
swimming squad to assess the effects of swim-trainingintensity on the physical qualities of the shoulder. Sixteen
regional- and national-level swimmers were part of a
convenience sample. According to an a priori power
analysis (version 3.1.9.2; G*Power, Heinrich-Heine-Uni-
versit ¨at, D¨ usseldorf, Germany) using the ttest for means (1
group), a sample size of 15 participants would be required
to detect a large effect size (0.8) after swim training, with a
power of 0.80 and an alevel of .05. The sample consisted
of 7 female and 9 male participants (age ¼14.663.9 years
[range ¼11–20 years], height ¼160.5612.7 cm, mass ¼
55.3612.5 kg). All swimmers trained in the same group
during the year and completed the same practices regularly,
regardless of age and level of competition. The participants
had a mean of 6 years of regular swimming experience
(range¼4–8 years), performed a mean of 5.5 days of swim
training per week (range ¼5–6 days), and completed a
swimming volume of 35 000 65000 m/week. All
swimmers were regularly active in regional and national
championships. The exclusion criteria were a history of
shoulder surgery, shoulder pain at the time of the study, andany pain in the 2 weeks before the study that interfered with
the ability to train or compete fully.
17All participants
provided written informed consent. For participants ,18
years old, parental or guardian signed consent was
obtained. The study was approved by our university’sethics board.
Procedures
All tests were performed by the same researcher (M.Y.),
who had 8 years of clinical experience. For each swimmer,measurements were recorded before and after low- and
high-intensity training sessions. On the testing day, general
demographic information of participants, such as sex, age,
limb dominance, height, mass, and forearm length, were
recorded. Limb dominance was determined by askingparticipants if they were right- or left-hand dominant.
Before the testing, participants performed a standardized
land-based warm-up consisting of multiplanar shoulder
movements using an elastic band that was supervised by the
tester. The warm-up consisted of 10 repetitions of ER andIR (08of shoulder abduction) with a yellow TheraBand
(The Hygenic Corporation, Akron, OH). Immediately after
the warm-up, baseline measurements were recorded in the
Journal of Athletic Training 55Downloaded from http://meridian.allenpress.com/jat/article-pdf/56/1/54/2882701/i1062-6050-56-1-54.pdf by guest on 12 August 2024

following order: shoulder-rotation ROM, shoulder JPS,
shoulder-rotation isometric peak torque, LD length, CET,
and handgrip peak force. All tests were standardized, andthe dominant side was assessed ﬁrst. Three trials of eachtest were performed on both limbs, and the results wereaveraged for further analysis. Immediately after completionof the training, swimmers exited the pool and repeated thebaseline testing. The testing was conducted over 8 weeks
because of the availability of only 1 researcher, and
participants completed both sessions at least 8 times. Datawere collected on the same days each week to ensure thatthe swimming sessions were the same. The tests wereperformed in block order: the high-intensity session datawere collected on Wednesday afternoons, whereas the low-intensity session data were collected on Friday afternoonsof the same week. All swimmers completed an aerobic-
kick–focused session on Thursday morning between
sessions. No weight training was performed before or afterthe testing sessions.
Instrumentation and Outcome Measures
The Goniometer Pro (5fuf5 Co, Bloomﬁeld, NJ) digital
inclinometer application for the iPhone (Apple, Inc,Cupertino, CA) was used to measure shoulder ROM, JPS,LD length, and CET. Mobile telephone applications are
widely used in clinical practice. They have been shown to
be reliable and valid when compared with the criterion-standard universal goniometer in patients with symptomaticshoulders.
19A detailed description of each measurement
can be found in Supplemental Table 1 (see SupplementalTable 1, available online at http://dx.doi.org/10.4085/1062-6050-0357-19.S1). We measured ROM actively because it
reﬂects the ability of swimmers to use their available
movement. To assess IR ROM, we performed scapularstabilization, which has been shown to be more reliablethan other methods.
20For ER ROM assessment, the end
range was determined using the available range without anystabilization.
21We followed the protocol of Herrington and
Horsley22to assess JPS. The test was performed in the
midrange position (20% of the available ER ROM) because
feedback in this position relies more on the musculotendi-
nous structures.23Latissimus dorsi length assessment was
based on the protocol of Herrington and Horsley22using
pressure biofeedback (model Pressure Biofeedback Stabi-lizer; Chattanooga Group, Hixson, TN) to supervise theposterior pelvic tilt movement during the procedure.Finally, the CET was performed using the protocol of
Blanch
15in a swimmer population.
Regarding force assessment, a handheld dynamometer
(model Hoggan MicroFET2; Scientiﬁc LLC, Salt LakeCity, UT) was used to measure shoulder-rotation isometric
peak torque, which has been shown to be reliable and valid
in different populations compared with the criterion-standard isokinetic dynamometry.
24The testing position
of 908of shoulder abduction was used to recreate the mid–
pull-through and recovery phases performed during thestroke.
25Force was converted into torque (in newton
meters) by multiplying the absolute force (in newtons) bythe lever arm length (in meters) of the dominant and
nondominant sides. Next, torque was normalized to body
weight (Nm/kg) and expressed as the percentage of changebetween sessions. For HGF assessment, a hand dynamom-eter (model T.K.K.5001 Grip-A; Takei Scientiﬁc Instru-
ments Co, Ltd, Nigata City, Japan) was used. Hand
dynamometers are the criterion-standard tool for assessingHGF and have been shown to be reliable in severalpopulations and positions.
26Furthermore, HGF was nor-
malized to body weight and expressed as the percentage ofchange between sessions.
Training Intensity Definition
Training intensity can be categorized into relative zones
(ie, low, moderate, high) based on the stimulus from thetraining load.
27Training load has been deﬁned as ‘‘the
cumulative amount of stress placed on an individual from asingle or multiple training sessions (structure or unstruc-tured) over a period of time. ’’
8(pg1)According to consensus
statements on training loads,8,27the recommendation is that
a combination of external (amount of work performed by
the athlete) and internal (athlete’s response to external load)
training loads should be used to monitor an athlete’sresponse to training. The intensity of the training sessionswas based on the external training loads and categorized aslow or high. Considering that each session lasted 1 hour andconsisted of comparable total volumes of 3 km, theintensity was determined by the volume swum at or abovethe threshold pace. Threshold pace was previously
determined by the coach, and all athletes were familiar
with and had experience swimming at this intensity (a hardsustainable pace).
During the low-intensity training session, 0% of the
swimming was completed at or above the threshold pace.
The session was evenly balanced among the 4 swimmingstrokes, with the athletes instructed to complete the entirevolume at a low-intensity recovery pace. Conversely,during the high-intensity training session, one-third of thevolume was dedicated to performing the athlete’s number 1stroke at or above the threshold pace. The remaining swimvolume was designated for warm-up, dedicated skill
practice, and swim down. A detailed description of each
session can be found in Supplemental Table 2 (seeSupplemental Table 2, available online at http://dx.doi.org/10.4085/1062-6050-0357-19.S1). The intensity of thesession was conﬁrmed by the swimmer’s perception ofintensity (internal load). Internal loads were quantiﬁed bythe rating of perceived exertion (RPE) based on the
modiﬁed version of the category-ratio scale of Borg.
28
Immediately after completing the training, the swimmers
were asked, ‘‘How hard was your workout? ’’The RPE is a
valid and simple measurement for assessing trainingintensity in athletes and is commonly used to monitorathletes’ physiological stress during or after training orcompetition.
28The RPE method has also been shown to be
consistent with objective physiological indices, such as
heart rate, in athletes.29
Reliability of Measurements
Before data collection, we performed a pilot study with
10 participants to assess the test-retest reliability of eachmeasurement. We took each measurement before and aftera 2-hour period. The rationale for this time frame was that anormal swimming session lasts around 2 hours.
17The

surement (SEM), and minimal detectable change (MDC)

with 95% conﬁdence interval for each physical quality were
calculated. These results provided information to enable us
to determine whether the changes in the shoulder physical
qualities after a swim-training session were real or due tomeasurement error. The results of this pilot study are shown
in Table 1.
Statistical Analysis
For the statistical analysis, SPSS (version 25; IBM Corp,
Armonk, NY) was used. The Shapiro-Wilk test wasperformed to determine if the variables had a normal
distribution. The analysis was conducted separately for the
dominant and nondominant sides. To determine if adifference in the shoulder physical qualities was present
before and after a training session, we used the Wilcoxon
signed rank test if the sample was not normally distributed
and the paired ttest if it was normally distributed. The a
level was set at /C20.05. We calculated the Cohen d effect size
to determine the magnitude of any difference among
measurements. The following effect size values were
considered: .0.8 ( large ), 0.5–0.79 ( moderate ), 0.49–0.20
(small ), and,0.2 (trivial ).

RESULTS
Sixteen swimmers were analyzed before and after the
low- and high-intensity training sessions. All swimmers
completed both sessions with no dropouts. Regarding theRPE, we observed a difference between sessions ( P,
.001). Swimmers demonstrated RPE averages of 2.44 61.2
(minimum–maximum ¼1–4) and 7.44 61.3 (minimum–
maximum ¼5–9) for the low- and high-intensity session,
respectively. No swimmers experienced shoulder painduring either session. The comparison between pre- and
postswim tests for both the low- and high-intensity training
sessions are shown in Tables 2 and 3.High-Intensity Training Session
We observed changes in ER ROM and rotation isometric
peak torque that were different. Box plots showing thedifferences between the low- and high-intensity sessions for
ER ROM and isometric peak torque are displayed in Figures
1 and 2, respectively. Decreases were present in ER ROM,with large effect sizes for the dominant ( P,.001; change ¼
/C07.88;d¼1.10) and nondominant ( P¼.002; change ¼/C06.58;
d¼1.02) sides. Based on the pilot study results, the values of
change in ER ROM on the dominant and nondominant sides
exceeded the SEM and MDC. A decrease in ER ROM below938has been reported as a cutoff value for the development
of shoulder pain in swimmers.
11After the training session, 8
of 16 (50%) and 7 of 16 (43.8%) swimmers exhibited a
decrease in ER ROM below this value on the dominant andnondominant sides, respectively.
Regarding isometric peak torque, we found decreases in
the internal rotators, with small effect sizes for thedominant ( P,.001; d ¼0.42) and nondominant ( P¼
.03; d ¼0.20) sides. The changes represented mean
decreases of 11.4% (0.05 Nm/kg) and 6.6% (0.03 Nm/kg)
in body weight for the dominant and nondominant sides,respectively. For both sides, the value of change exceededthe SEM but not the MDC. With respect to external-rotatorisometric peak torque, we observed a decrease for the
dominant side, with a small effect size ( P¼.004; d ¼0.27).
The change represented a mean decrease of 8.7% (0.03 Nm/kg) of body weight. The value of change exceeded the SEMbut not the MDC. Regarding the nondominant side,external-rotator isometric peak torque decreased, with a
s m a l le f f e c ts i z e( P¼.02; d ¼0.25). The change
represented a mean decrease of 7.6% (0.03 Nm/kg) ofbody weight. In this case, the value of change exceeded theSEM and MDC. We observed no differences between
preswim and postswim measurements for the IR ROM, JPS,
LD length, CET, or HGF outcomes.Table 1. Two-Hour Test-Retest Reliability for the Outcome Measures Calculated From the Pilot Study (N ¼10)

Low-Intensity Training Session
After the session, only the HGF on the nondominant side
decreased, with a trivial effect size ( P¼.02; d¼0.10). The
change represented a mean decrease of 2.9% (0.01 kg/body
mass) in body weight. The change did not exceed the SEMor the MDC, probably indicating that it was due to chanceor random error. We noted no differences between preswimand postswim measurements in any of the other measure-ments. Regarding ER ROM, 1 of 16 (6.2%) and 4 of 16(25%) swimmers displayed decreases below 93 8on the
dominant and nondominant sides, respectively.
DISCUSSION
Our study was conducted to determine the effect of 2
training intensities on the physical qualities of the shoulder
in competitive swimmers. After high-intensity sessions,
active ER ROM and rotation isometric peak torque werereduced, but IR ROM, JPS, LD length, CET score, andHGF did not change. However, after the low-intensity

session, we identiﬁed no changes in any of the physical
qualities. Considering the changes in certain physical
qualities after the high-intensity session, it was important
to establish whether these changes were clinically mean-ingful. Clinical meaningfulness was determined by the
magnitude of the change (ie, effect size) and whether the
change values exceeded the SEM and MDC.
31For ER
ROM, we observed large effect sizes, with change values
that exceeded the MDC, whereas isometric peak torque had
small effect sizes, with only the external-rotator isometricpeak torque of the nondominant side exceeding the MDC (a
detailed explanation of the clinical meaningfulness of each
variable is provided in the following subsection). Weshowed that musculoskeletal adaptations varied in responseto training intensity over a short period (ie, 1 training
session). This suggests that some physical qualities are in
constant ﬂuctuation due to the training loads being applied.Bittencourt et al
7proposed that athletes are open and
dynamic systems that interact with the environment and
evolve over time. Thus, our results provided informationabout the short-term interaction between training intensity
and the physical qualities of the shoulder in competitive
swimmers. We suggest that the intensity of the swimtraining may be an important factor that inﬂuences acutechanges in the physical qualities of the shoulder and,
therefore, dynamically modiﬁes the potential risk of injury.
In addition to the mean decreases in ER ROM and
isometric peak torque after the high-intensity training, thevariability of the responses among swimmers was impor-tant (Figures 1 and 2). Windt and Gabbett
9proposed that a
speciﬁc external load elicits different internal responses.
Our results support this concept: the same training intensityproduced different responses among swimmers. Thus, the
shoulder physical qualities need to be regularly monitored,
and training loads need to be progressed individually.
8
Training Intensity
The intensity of the sessions was deﬁned by the coach
and determined by the volume swum at or above the pacethreshold. The swimmers exhibited higher RPE values after
the high-intensity session (7.44 61.3) than the low-intensity session (2.44 61.2). Based on the modiﬁed
version of the category-ratio scale of Borg,
28the low-
intensity session was perceived as easy, whereas the high-
intensity session was perceived as very hard . A mean RPE
value of 7 61.3 has been associated with the onset of
blood lactate accumulation in female distance runners.32
Hence, the high-intensity session would probably result inthe accumulation of blood lactate, leading to fatigue. Thismight explain the negative effects on ER ROM and rotationisometric peak torque after the high-intensity but not thelow-intensity session.
Shoulder-Rotation ROM
Internal-rotation ROM was not affected after the high- or
low-intensity training session. These results are in accor-dance with those of Matthews et al
18and Higson et al,17
who reported no changes in IR ROM after a swim-trainingsession. In contrast, acute reductions in IR ROM of thedominant side have been described after tennis
33and
baseball34training. Researchers33have indicated that the
high levels of eccentric stress placed on the externalrotators to decelerate the throwing or striking motion mayincrease posterior rotator cuff stiffness and consequentlydecrease IR ROM. The lack of changes found in the studiesof swimmers might be explained by the low activation level

of the external rotators during the freestyle stroke35
combined with the endurance nature of the sport. Regarding
ER ROM, we observed reductions after the high-intensitybut not the low-intensity training session. After the high-intensity session, ER ROM decreased by 7.8 8on the
dominant side and 6.5 8on the nondominant side with large
effect sizes (dominant side: d ¼1.10; nondominant side: d ¼
1.02). An effect size of 1.0 indicates that the mean of thepostsession is at the 84th percentile of the presession; thus,a swimmer with an average score in the postsession had alower ER ROM score than 84% of the swimmers in thepresession.
36Also, the probability of correctly guessing if a
swimmer performed a low- or high-intensity session was69% based on the ER ROM score alone.
36Furthermore,
postswim changes in ROM exceeded the MDC on bothsides. Therefore, we can be 95% conﬁdent that the changesin ER ROM after a high-intensity training session were
attributable to the swim training and not due to measure-
ment error. The large effect sizes reported and the valuesexceeding the MDC conﬁrmed the clinical meaningfulnessof the changes in ER ROM.
Authors of 2 studies
17,18of swimmers have noted
reductions in ER ROM after a training session. Matthewset al
18found ER ROM decreases of 5.29 8on the dominant
side and 3.18 8on the nondominant side after a fatiguing
protocol consisting of 8 sets of a 100-m swim. The effectsizes were moderate for the dominant side (d ¼0.75) and
small for the nondominant side (d ¼0.42). The larger effect
sizes in our study may be explained by the greater totaltraining volume (3000 m versus 1000 m). However, giventhe different deﬁnitions of training intensity and measuresused to conﬁrm fatigue, it is difﬁcult to compare studies.
Matthews et al
18set the swimming intensity at 85% of the
swimmers’ best 100-m times, and blood lactate levels wereused as an objective measure to conﬁrm fatigue. In contrast,in our study, the intensity was set in relation to thethreshold pace, and RPE was used as a subjective measureof fatigue. In a later study, Higson et al
17demonstrated a
decrease in ER ROM of 3.4 8, with a moderate effect size (d
¼0.34) after a 2-hour training session. Higson et al17
deﬁned the external training load only in terms of time (2
hours), without specifying the distance or intensity.Furthermore, the internal loads were not measured;therefore, the swimmers’ response to the training wasunknown. Consensus statements on training loads andinjury
8,27recommended combining internal and external
training loads to monitor an athlete’s response to training.Moreover, subjective measures of internal loads, such asthe RPE, could be preferable because they are easily used inthe clinical setting.
8
The acute reductions in ER ROM after swim training
may be explained by the biomechanics of the stroke. Therepetitive forces during swimming can lead to hypertrophicchanges and muscular tightness of the internal rotators,consequently decreasing ER ROM.
17Deﬁcits in shoulder
ER ROM have been shown to be a potential risk factor forshoulder pain in competitive swimmers.
11In a 1-year
prospective study, Walker et al11found that competitive
swimmers with ER ROM values ,938measured actively at
the beginning of the season were at 12.5 times greater riskof developing shoulder pain that resulted in missed ormodiﬁed training. The authors
11suggested that limited ER
ROM during the recovery phase may contribute to shoulderpathomechanics. Interestingly, after the high-intensity
training session, half of our swimmers (8/16) decreased
their ER ROM to ,938in the dominant limb. In contrast,
after the low-intensity session, only 1 swimmer had an ERROM of ,938on the dominant side. After a high-intensity
training session, active ER ROM decreased to valuesassociated with the risk of shoulder injury in a signiﬁcantnumber of swimmers.
Shoulder-Rotation Isometric Peak Torque
Isometric peak torque decreased for both the internal and
external rotators after the high-intensity but not the low-
intensity session. After the high-intensity session, torque
decreased between 6.6% and 11.4% of body weight. Inspite of the changes, the effect sizes were small, rangingfrom 0.20 to 0.42. This indicated that a swimmer with anaverage score in the postsession had less rotation torquethan 58% to 66% of the swimmers in the presession.
36
Furthermore, the probability of correctly guessing if aswimmer performed a low- or high-intensity session wasbetween 54% and 58% based on test score alone.
36Only the
changes in the external rotators of the nondominant side
exceeded the MDC. Therefore, we can be 95% conﬁdentthat the changes were attributable to the swim training andnot to measurement error. The changes in the internal-rotator torque on both sides and external-rotator torque onthe dominant side exceeded the SEM but not the MDC.Hence, we can be conﬁdent only 68% of the time that thechanges were not due to an error. The interpretation ofthese results indicated that the small effect sizes for
isometric peak torque might weaken their clinical mean-
ingfulness. Furthermore, only the changes in the externalrotators on the nondominant side exceeded the MDC and,consequently, reﬂected clinical meaningfulness.
Matthews et al
18were the sole researchers to investigate
the effect of swim training on shoulder isometric force, and
they reported contradictory ﬁndings. Although fatigue was
conﬁrmed by blood lactate levels, rotation isometric forcedid not change after a swim-training session in 17 national-level swimmers.
18Given the different training protocols
performed, it is difﬁcult to explain the variable ﬁndingsbetween studies. Considering that the participants’ ages andlevels of competition were similar, the different testingpositions might have inﬂuenced the results. We assessedforce in the supine position, whereas Matthews et al
18
measured it in the standing position. Authors37have
suggested that upper limb strength assessments performedin the standing position are inﬂuenced by the synergisticeffects of the lower limb muscles. The lack of change inshoulder force described by Matthews et al
18may have
been due to compensation of the lower limbs.
The acute decrease in internal-rotator torque that we
noted may be explained by the predominant internal-rotatorforces that occur during swimming.
35Because of the
repetitive internal-rotator forces, the subscapularis muscleis constantly active during all stroke phases, stabilizing theglenohumeral joint.
35However, this constant activity may
render the subscapularis muscle susceptible to fatigue.35
Deﬁcits in internal-rotator forces have been shown to be a
potential risk factor for shoulder pain in swimmers.6,12Bak
and Magnusson12and Tate et al6identiﬁed decreases in
internal-rotator force in the injured shoulders of competi-

tive swimmers, suggesting that internal-rotator deﬁcits may
affect stroke dynamics. These ﬁndings are supported by
Scovazzo et al,38who used electromyography to demon-
strate decreased subscapularis activity during the midre-covery phase in the painful shoulders of swimmers.Regarding external-rotator torque, we reported decreasesafter the high-intensity session on both the dominant and
nondominant sides. The infraspinatus muscle is mainly
active during the midrecovery phase to control the internal-rotator forces of the subscapularis muscle, whereas the teresminor muscle controls the internal-rotator forces of thepectoralis major muscle during the pull phase.
35With
respect to the relationship between external-rotator weak-ness and risk of shoulder injury in swimmers, Beach et al
13
determined that swimmers with shoulder pain displayeddecreased external-rotator endurance as measured usingisokinetic dynamometry. Investigators
39have indicated that
decreased infraspinatus activity led to glenohumeralinstability, which may result in functional impingement.However, given the cross-sectional designs of studies
addressing the relationship between shoulder pain and
rotator force, whether the force deﬁcits seen were due topain inhibition or a compensatory strategy to remain painfree is unknown. In addition to ER ROM, we found greatermean reductions in rotation isometric peak torque on thedominant than the nondominant side. An explanation forthese ﬁndings may be that during swimming, the dominant
limb is mainly used for propulsion and the nondominant
limb for control and support.
17Despite the greater mean
reductions on the dominant side, the changes on thenondominant side were more variable (Figures 1 and 2).
Limitations
Our study had limitations. Although we calculated the
necessary sample size, it was small for the competitive
swimmer population and probably limits the generalizationof the results. The large age range could also have been alimitation because it might not have represented theadaptations of a speciﬁc age group. A history of shoulderpain was a nonmodiﬁable risk factor for shoulder pain inswimmers.
1,6We excluded only swimmers with shoulder
pain at the time of the study or any pain in the 2 weeks
before the study that had interfered with the ability to trainor compete fully and did not exclude swimmers with ahistory of shoulder pain. A history of shoulder pain mighthave been a confounding factor that affected the results.However, studying swimmers without a history of shoulder
pain is challenging because most describe either a history of
shoulder pain or shoulder symptoms at the time of testing.
17
Another limitation of our study was that all swimmers werenot all measured on the same day because only 1 researcherwas available. To mitigate this, the measurements weretaken on the same days and at the same times every week.Yet other uncontrollable factors could have inﬂuenced the
results. Despite the pre- and postswim differences in
rotation torque and values exceeding the SEM, the readermust be aware of the small effect sizes. This might be aproblem with respect to determining a true differencebetween pre- and postswim scores. Another possiblelimitation was that swimmers were not randomized to the
different intensity sessions. Instead, we performed the tests
in block order: the high-intensity session on Wednesdayand the low-intensity session on Friday of the same week. It
is possible that the results of the Friday sessions could have
been affected by the Wednesday sessions. Still, no changesoccurred in the Friday sessions; therefore, carryover effectsdid not appear to have inﬂuenced the Friday sessions,regardless of the activity on Thursday. In addition, wefocused only on the acute postswim adaptations as a resultof training intensity without including other training-load
variables, such as time and volume. Finally, we assessed
only the interactions between training loads and musculo-skeletal risk factors. Bittencourt et al
7suggested that the
athlete should be analyzed as a complex system, with afocus on multilevel risk factors, including biomechanical,behavioral, psychological, and physiological factors.
Further research is needed to analyze the adaptations in
different age groups and levels of competition. Also, largersample sizes will allow swimmers to be subdivided intogroups according to their training responses so that we canunderstand speciﬁc group adaptations. It may also benecessary to investigate how other components of training
loads, such as training time and volume, affect these
physical qualities. Furthermore, it is important to evaluatethe cumulative effects of training loads on these physicalqualities. Ideally, longitudinal research should be done tomonitor ER ROM and isometric peak torque, which willallow us to understand changes over time and theirrelationship with the development of shoulder pain.Additional work is needed to evaluate the recovery time
of these variables after a high-intensity session. Finally,
investigating the interactions of training loads withpsychological and behavioral factors may also be neces-sary.
CONCLUSIONS
Our results demonstrated that the intensity of a training
session may be an important factor that leads to
maladaptive changes in the physical qualities of the
shoulder. A high-intensity training session immediatelydecreased shoulder active ER ROM and rotation isometricpeak torque in competitive swimmers, particularly on thedominant side. However, we observed no changes in any ofthe physical qualities after the low-intensity session. Weshowed that these physical qualities changed dynamicallyas a result of the training load applied. This provides
information about the short-term interaction between
training intensity and the physical qualities of the shoulderin competitive swimmers. Shoulder ER ROM and rotatorforce have been described as potential modiﬁable riskfactors for shoulder pain in this population; hence, theirmaladaptive changes may increase the risk of shoulderinjury in subsequent training. Considering this, the
application of appropriate training loads may be required
to minimize the risk of injury associated with thesechanges. High training loads are necessary to increase loadcapacity and tolerate further loads
9; nevertheless, it is
essential to know when to train hard. Understanding theappropriate timing of a strenuous training session canenhance load capacity and performance without increasingthe detrimental effects on shoulder physical qualities.
Clinically, our ﬁndings suggested the importance of
individual in-season monitoring of ER ROM and rotationisometric peak torque. Regular monitoring can ensure that

swimmers have restored these qualities before or after
undertaking high-intensity training. If these qualities areimpaired before a high-intensity session, practitioners andcoaches can adjust the training loads to avoid further
maladaptations and reduce the potential risk of injury.
Furthermore, identifying deﬁcits in postswim rotationtorque and ER ROM may permit early interventions and
serve as a practical way to reduce the athlete’s suscepti-
bility to shoulder injury. In addition, an individualizedregular exercise program to maintain ER ROM andimprove shoulder-rotation torque should be performed to
minimize these postswim adaptations. Finally, training
intensity can be easily quantiﬁed in clinical practice by theRPE, which provides an individual perspective of thetraining load.
