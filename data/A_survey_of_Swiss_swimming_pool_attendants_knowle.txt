A Survey of Swiss  
Swimming Pool Attendants’ Knowledge of First-Aid Treatment after Lip and Dental Injuries
Key words: dental trauma, lip injuries, swimming pool accidents
Introduction
Many dental accidents among children and adolescents hap-
pen at school or during after-school activities. During this time, 
they are often under the supervision of adults other than their 
parents/guardians (Mcintyre et al. 2008).  The responsible 
adults are seldom familiar with the proper course of action in 
case of dental trauma. Several studies have reported that teach-
ers and other lay persons are not adequately informed about 
first aid after dental injuries (Hamilton et al. 1997, Pacheco et 
al. 2003, Al-Jundi et al. 2005, Al-Asfour et al. 2008, Mcintyre 
et al. 2008).  Other studies have shown that even dentists, 
doctors, and emergency personnel do not possess sufficient knowledge of first aid after dental trauma 
(Lin et al. 2006, Yeng & Parashos 2008).  Up to now, guidelines on responding 
to trauma in the oral region have been underrepresented in the first-aid literature 
(Zadik 2007).  However, the correct re-
sponse at the scene of the accident crucially influences the 
healing and long-term prognosis of avulsed and replanted teeth. 
Whether healing results in restored function or not depends 
on the extra-oral storage of the avulsed tooth (Kirschner et al. 
2006).  Cytophysiological extra-oral storage is available thanks 
to special dental first-aid kits that were developed based on cell 
nutrient media (SOS Zahnbox, Miradent, Duisburg, Germany; Dentosafe
®, Medice, Iserlohn, Germany; EMT Toothsaver, 
 Gering, Nebraska (USA); Curasafe, Curaden International, 
Kriens, Switzerland). These dental first-aid kits are available without a prescription at all pharmacies and provide good Summary  Although dental injuries are com-
mon occurrences at swimming pools, there 
are very few publications about them. The purpose of this study was to interview pool 
attendants at public swimming pools/bathing 
resorts in Switzerland on lip and dental inju-ries in 2007. The questions focussed on their knowledge of ﬁrst aid, the frequency and ac-cident site of lip and tooth trauma, as well as the storage medium for avulsed teeth. Ques-tions were also asked about the presence of 
a “dental ﬁrst-aid kit” and the poster on dental 
ﬁrst aid. 606 public pools were contacted, and 
one pool attendant per pool was interviewed by telephone. 553 individuals participated;  
53 declined to take part. The results show that 
in 2007, 40% of the interviewed pool atten-dants (n = 221) had witnessed at least one lip 
injury, and 36.9% (n = 204) at least one tooth trauma. At pools with slides, accidents were more frequent (p < 0.001), and the waterslide 
was the most common accident site. The pool 
attendants provided satisfactory answers on their actions after lip and dental injuries. 
However, 68.7% could not adequately answer 
the questions on storage of avulsed teeth. Only 
74 pool attendants had a dental ﬁrst-aid kit. Of these, only 68 used the kits as the storage 
medium for avulsed teeth. 59 pool attendants 
were in possession of the poster on dental ﬁrst 
aid. Overall, it was shown that pool attendants 
who had a dental ﬁrst-aid kit and a dental ﬁrst aid poster gave better answers on how to handle tooth trauma.Miriam Merz1

pated. It was not possible to include 50 of the ca. 650 public 
swimming pools/resorts: they either had no telephone or no 
pool attendant, or were currently undergoing remodeling. One 
pool attendant per swimming pool/resort was interviewed about lip and dental injuries during 2007. If a swimming pool employed more than one attendant, the one with the most working hours was interviewed. The same person conducted all telephone interviews according to a questionnaire (Tab. I). 
Since most of the pool attendants did not keep written records 
of accidents, they had to rely on their memory.
The pool attendants were asked whether they had a dental 
first-aid kit and a dental first-aid poster. Questions were also asked about the type of swimming pool or resort. These and the Swiss cantons were compared in terms of the frequency of injuries, response of the person interviewed, and presence of the dental first-aid kit and poster. Results are not presented for all cantons (see below). Accidents occurring in combined in-
door/outdoor pools were not differentiated in terms of whether 
they happened indoors or out.
The spontaneous answers of the pool attendants on how 
they responded to lip injuries were divided into four groups (A, B, C, and D). These are shown in Table II; multiple answers were possible. In order to compare the cantons and the pool 
types, every pool attendant received an overall evaluation. The 
overall evaluation of the answers was subdivided into three categories: “good” (group A and combinations of groups B, C and D), “satisfactory” (group B and C, and combinations of B and D or C and D), and “unsatisfactory” (group D alone). If an overall “good” result was found, the wound treatment was considered adequate. If the overall result was “satisfactory”, the treatment approach was correct, but relevant factors of adequate wound treatment were lacking. If the overall result was classified as “unsatisfactory”, the wound treatment was 
absolutely inadequate. Subsequently, the pool attendants were 
interviewed about their response to dental injuries. Injuries were divided into the types “avulsion”, “dislocation”, and “tooth fracture”, after these terms were defined for the atten-dant. The type of dentition (primary or permanent) did not play a role. The evaluation of the treatment and the overall conditions for the temporary storage of avulsed teeth 
(Pohl & 
Kirschner 1994, Pohl et al. 1999, Pohl et al. 2005, Kirschner et al. 2006, Filippi et al. 2008).
 They do not contain antibiot-
ics and have a shelf life of up to three years at room tempera-ture 
(Kirschner et al. 2006).
Dental injuries associated with various types of sports have 
often been described in the literature. There, too, the dental first-aid kit is not well enough known or widespread 
(Lang et 
al. 2002, Perunski et al. 2005, Persic et al. 2006, Fasciglione et al. 2007, Müller et al. 2008).
 Only a few studies have ex-
clusively addressed swimming pools and the injuries incurred there 
(Malpass et al. 1981, Saunders 1988, Mikkelsen et al. 
1994, Ball 1998, Nielsen & Freund 2003).  Only one publication 
described the swimming pool as the site of dental trauma 
(Fakhruddin et al. 2008).  Most swimming pool accidents oc-
curred by falling (Nielsen & Freund 2003).  The most severe 
injuries happened on waterslides (Mikkelsen et al. 1994),  when 
the person slid head first and collided with the slide itself or with another person
 (Malpass et al. 1981).
Until now, pool attendants’ knowledge of first aid for tooth 
and lip injuries has not been examined. The purpose of the 
present study was to determine the frequency of lip and dental 
injuries at Swiss swimming pools/bathing resorts and to evalu-
ate pool attendants’ knowledge of the emergency management 
of these injuries. In addition, the number of swimming pools/resorts equipped with a dental first-aid kit or a dental first-aid poster (e. g., a poster designed by the Center of Dental Trau-matology of the University of Basel, which describes the cor-rect response after tooth injury) was recorded. All posters 
which described emergency management of dental trauma were 
accepted as a correct answer. Such posters have been shown to have a positive influence on the response of teachers 
(Lieger 
et al. 2009).
Materials and Methods

survival of periodontal cells on the root surface was ensured 
for at least one hour. It was assumed that the injured person was usually treated by a dentist within this time frame. Ques-tions about the length of time an avulsed tooth could poten-tially spend extra-orally were not asked. For dental injuries, the category “satisfactory” was intentionally omitted. The cor-relation between information available (dental first-aid kit/ poster) and extent of knowledge (choice of storage medium) of the pool attendants was also examined.
The annual number of visitors per year per swimming pool 
or resort was also considered relevant. The categories were compared in terms of frequency of injuries and the presence of the dental first-aid kit and a dental first-aid poster. It was assumed that the frequency of injuries would be higher at pools/resorts with a large number of visitors, since these tend to be equipped with slides and diving boards, and thus more 
injuries occur. Further, an evaluation of swimming pool/resort evaluation (for the comparison between cantons and type of 
swimming pool/resort) for each pool attendant were per-
formed according to the criteria “good” and “unsatisfactory”. Treatment of an avulsion/tooth fracture was judged as “good” if the attendant looked for or would look for the tooth/the tooth fragment, gave the tooth/the tooth fragment to the in-jured person, and immediately referred him/her to a dentist’s 
office or dental clinic. To qualify as “good” in terms of disloca-
tions, the attendant had to know that the tooth was not to be touched and that the injured person had to be referred to a dentist. In particular, questions were asked about transport/storage media for avulsed and fractured teeth. To compare 
cantons and swimming pool/resort types, an overall evaluation 
for transport media after avulsion was done, and this was given 
a score of “good” or “unsatisfactory.” Multiple answers includ-
ing good and unsatisfactory responses received an overall score 
of “unsatisfactory”. A response was judged to be “good” if the Lip injuries

Zurich (29/110) and Bern (13/81). There were statistically sig-
nificant differences between cantons in terms of the frequency 
of the poster (p < 0.001). Posters were most frequently found 
in the cantons Basel-Stadt (3/6), Basel-Land (15/17), Zurich 
(7/110) and Bern (8/81). The type of swimming pool or bathing 
resort had no significant influence on the presence of a dental first-aid kit or poster (p > 0.05).
547 (no answer: 6) and 546 (no answer: 7) of the attendants 
answered the question on management of lip injuries and dental trauma, respectively. 515 (no answer: 38) replied to the question about transport media (Tab. II).equipment in terms of the risk factors “slide” and “diving 
board” was conducted. If the pool attendant mentioned these as an accident site (asked only in case of injuries), the length of the waterslide and the height of the diving board were re-corded. Injured persons (lip/tooth injuries) were divided into 
groups according to age and gender, and lip and tooth injuries 
were compared on this basis.
In order to analyze correlations between variable categories, 
results were cross-tabulated and submitted to Fisher’s Exact test. A p-value less than 0.05 was considered significant. Be-
cause this was an explorative study, p-values were not corrected 
for multiple comparisons. All evaluations were performed by the statistical software R version 2.7.1 (R Development Core Team, 2008; R: A language and environment for statistical computing. R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).
Results
Of 606 pool attendants from as many swimming pools/resorts, 
91.3% (n = 553/606) participated in the study. In 2007, 40% 
(221/553) observed at least one lip injury and 36.9% (204/553) 
at least one tooth injury (Fig. 1). Of the attendants who ob-served injuries, 26.2% (n = 145/553) saw both types. Tooth fractures occurred in 49.6% (n = 123/248) of the cases, avul-sions in 25.4% (n = 63/248), and dislocation injuries in 15.3% (n = 38/248). 9.3% (n = 23/248) indicated that all types of den-
tal trauma occurred with equal frequency, and 0.4% (n = 1/248) 
did not know the type of dental injury. 
Of the participating attendants, 45.9% (n = 254/553) worked 
at outdoor pools (O), 23.9% (n = 132/553) at indoor pools (I), 16.5% (n = 91/553) at lakeside bathing resorts (L), 11.9% (n = 66/553) at combined indoor/outdoor pools (O/I), 1.3% 
(n = 7/553) at riverside bathing resorts (R), and 0.5% (n = 3/553) 
at a combined indoor pool/lakeside resort (I/L). Not all atten-dants answered all questions. 13.6% (n = 74/546) of the swim-
ming pools/resorts had a dental first-aid kit, 10.6% (n = 58/546) 
were merely aware of their existence, and 75.8% (n = 414/546) had never heard of them (546 attendants, no answer: 7). Only 
10.8% (n = 59/545) had a dental first-aid poster (545 attendants, 
no answer: 8, Fig. 2). Statistically significant differences existed 
between cantons in terms of the presence of dental first-aid kits (p < 0.001). The highest proportions of dental first-aid kits 
(compared to the number of surveyed swimming pools/resorts) 
were found in the cantons Basel-Stadt (3/6), Basel-Land (15/17),

65.7%), and 5 cantons with a small number of interviewees 
more often gave good answers. The frequency of dental trauma 
differed significantly between types of swimming pools/resorts 
(p < 0.001). Most tooth injuries occurred in combined indoor/
outdoor pools (Fig. 3). The overall evaluation of avulsion man-
agement differed significantly between types of pools/resorts 
(p<0.05). Pool attendants at all pool/resort types, however, responded adequately more often (O: 84.1%, I: 88.5%, L: 77.3%, I/L: 93.9%, R: 100%, I/L: 66.7%) than inadequately. Pool/resort type had no significant influence on the overall evaluation of the choice of transport media (p > 0.05). Atten-
dants at all types of pools/resorts gave unsatisfactory responses 
more often (O: 67.3%, I: 69.6%, L: 78.3%, I/O: 58.5%, R: 57.1%, I/L: 100.0%).
The overall evaluation of transport media after avulsion and 
the presence of a dental first-aid kit or poster showed statisti-cally significant differences (p < 0.05). Pool attendants who had a dental first-aid kit or poster at work gave good more often than unsatisfactory answers.
Statistically significant differences (p < 0.001) were found in 
the correlation between number of visitors (Fig. 4, 547 atten-dants; no answer: 6) and the frequency of injuries or the pres-ence of a dental first-aid kit. Pools/resorts with over 100,000 visitors per year had the highest rate of injuries (Fig. 4) and 
more often possessed a dental first-aid kit (28.2% vs. 17.8% for 
50,000–100,000; 10.4% for 10,000 to 50,000; and 0.0% for 0–10,000 visitors; p < 0.001). The numbers of visitors did not 
correlate with the presence of a dental first-aid poster (p > 0.05).
Statistically significant differences existed between lip and 
tooth injuries depending on age and gender (p < 0.001). Chil-dren were most frequently and adults were seldom injured  
(Fig. 5). Further, there were gender-dependent differences: boys 
had dental trauma significantly more often than girls, but the 
group “both genders” dominated in lip injuries (Fig. 5).
294 pools/resorts had a slide, and 253 did not (no answer: 6). 
The correlation between the presence of a slide or diving board 
and occurrence of injuries was significant: there were signifi-cantly more lip injures (n = 160/294) with a slide than without (n = 61/253) (p < 0.001). 385 pools/resorts had a diving board and 162 did not (no answer: 6). Statistically significant more injuries occurred at pools/resorts with diving boards (n = 180/ 385) (p < 0.001) than without (n = 41/162). Dental trauma was also significantly more frequent when slides (n = 151/294) or 
diving boards (n = 164/385) were present (p < 0.001) than when 
they were absent (slide: n = 53/253, diving board: n = 40/162). 
The waterslide was the most frequently named accident site No significant difference (p > 0.05) was found between can-
tons in regard to the frequency of lip injuries and the overall evaluation of first-aid measures after lip injuries (Tab. III). In the overall evaluation, the majority of those interviewed in all 
cantons gave satisfactory (cantons with the highest number of 
swimming pools/resorts: Aargau: 61.5%, Bern: 50%, St. Gallen: 
53.3%, Zurich: 54.1%) to good answers (Aargau: 38.5%, Bern: 
47.5%, St. Gallen: 44.4%, Zurich: 45.9%). However, significant 
differences existed among the types of swimming pools/resorts 
regarding the occurrence of these injuries (p < 0.001). Most lip injuries occurred in combined indoor/outdoor pools (Fig. 3). The type of pool/resort had no statistically significant effect on the overall evaluation of the first-aid measures after lip 
injuries (p > 0.05, Tab. III). Pool attendants from all pool/resort 
types gave satisfactory (O: 54.8%, I: 60.3%, L: 52.3%, O/I: 51.5%, R: 42.8%, I/L: 33.3%) to good (O: 43.6%, I: 36.6%, L: 47.7, I/O: 48.5%, R: 57.1%, I/L: 66.7%) responses.
The frequency of tooth injuries did not differ significantly 
between cantons (p = 0.054). However, the management of avulsed teeth did (p < 0.05/overall evaluation, Tab. III). The answers of the pool attendants from all cantons tended to be satisfactory (Aargau: 94.2%, Bern: 93.7%, St. Gallen: 80.0%, Zurich: 90.8%) rather than unsatisfactory. One canton with a small number of interviewed attendants was the exception (Geneva: 42.8%). Significant differences also existed between 
cantons in the overall evaluation of transport media after avul-
sion (p < 0.001/Tab. III). All cantons with a large number of swimming pools/resorts more often gave unsatisfactory an-swers (Aargau: 67.3%, Bern: 67.5%, St. Gallen: 83.7%, Zurich: Type of emergency/measure score n %

mentioned most often. If that were the case, then the tooth 
fracture results would be overestimated.
A minority of pools/resorts had a dental emergency box or 
dental first-aid poster; hence, there is a definite need for more information and better dissemination thereof. The presence  
of these two items is variously described in the literature  
(Perunski et al. 2005, Persic et al. 2006, Fasciglione et al. 
2007, Müller et al. 2008). The greatest number of dental first-
aid kits and posters was found in the cantons Basel-Land, Basel-
Stadt, Zurich and Bern. This might be due to the fact that these 
cantons have university dental clinics. The type of pool/resort 
played a subordinate role in the presence/absence of a dental first-aid kit or poster.
Injuries were distributed equally across the 26 cantons, but 
the number of pools/resorts varied enormously (3–110 pools/resorts). Based on the lack of written accident documentation and different numbers of pool attendants employed, it should be borne in mind that the attendants may have unintention-ally provided erroneous information or may not have been able to remember all accidents. Nevertheless, the attendants themselves judged the flow of information to be good. De-
pending on the type of pool/resort, the distribution of injuries 
differed significantly. The different numbers of pools/resorts 
made the comparison difficult. Combined indoor/outdoor pools 
had the highest percentage of injuries (Fig. 3). They are open 
year-round and thus have the largest number of visitors. Over-
all, the majority of injuries were reported by attendants at outdoor pools; however, this was also the most common type of pool/resort (254) in the survey.
Most of the pool attendants were able to provide first aid for 
lip injuries (Tab. II). At all pool/resort types and in the 4 can-tons with the highest pool/resort density (Zurich, St. Gallen, Bern, Aargau), the responses were more often satisfactory to for both lip and tooth injuries (Tab. IV). The majority of the 
accidents happened on waterslides and 1-meter boards (Tab. V).
Discussion
The present study shows that lip and tooth injuries occur 
frequently at Swiss swimming pools/resorts due to conditions/
equipment which facilitate accidents. The frequency of lip in-
juries (40%) was somewhat greater than that of dental trauma (36.9%). This was also found in other reports 
(Persic et al. 
2006, Wasmer et al. 2008).  Similar studies describe a lower 
percent of dental trauma (Fasciglione et al. 2007, Soriano et 
al. 2007, Mcintyre et al. 2008).  Tooth fracture was the most 
commonly (49.6%) mentioned type of tooth injury. This agrees 
with earlier studies (Robertson et al. 2000, Lang et al. 2002, 
Perunski et al. 2005, Persic et al. 2006, Mcintyre et al. 2008, 
Müller et al. 2008).  It is, however, possible that this type of 
injury is the best known among lay persons and is therefore

good than unsatisfactory. The reason for this may be that lip 
injuries are similar to skin injuries, and lay people are better 
able to deal with such. The majority knew that, in case of avul-
sion, the tooth had to be sought and immediately sent along with the injured person to a dentist (Tab. II). The overall evalu-ation of the response to avulsion did not differ by canton but by the type of pool/resort. All cantons and pool/resort types more often gave good than unsatisfactory responses. The ex-ception was a canton and/or pool/resort type with a low num-ber of interviewed attendants. The lakeside resorts had the highest percentage of unsatisfactory answers, 22.7%. Accord-ing to some studies, the immediate replantation of an avulsed tooth by the lay person is the method of choice 
(Sterenborg 
et al. 1999, Flores et al. 2007),  but lay persons usually do not 
do this  (Trope 2002).  A recent review article states that 80% 
of those questioned would be reluctant to replant an avulsed 
tooth themselves due to lack of training and practice (Glendor 
2009).  Because lay persons can easily use a dental first-aid kit, 
they should be established as standard equipment at swim-ming pools/resorts 
(Pohl et al. 2005). No pool attendant in 
the present survey mentioned replantation as first aid for avul-
sion. In cases of dislocation injuries, most of the attendants 
would not touch the injured tooth. In this instance, ignorance 
tended to prompt the right reaction.
The prognosis of an avulsed tooth depends on the storage 
medium  (Blomlöf & Otteskog 1980, Kirschner et al. 2006, 
Filippi et al. 2008).  Non-physiological storage leads to replace-
ment resorption after replantation and culminates in tooth loss 
(Pohl et al. 1999).  For this reason, the tooth should be 
placed in a cytocompatible, cytophysiological medium as soon 
as possible (Pohl et al. 1999, Pohl et al. 2005, Kirschner et al. 
2006).  The various transport media have been examined by 
different authors. The following are somewhat suitable, al-though not physiological: milk, Hanks balanced salt solution, saliva, wrapping in plastic wrap 
(Trope & Friedman 1992, 
Huang et al. 1996, Sterenborg et al. 1999, Pohl et al. 1999, 
Glendor 2000, Pohl et al. 2005, Cohenca et al. 2006, Sonoda 
et al. 2008).  The present study showed that pool attendants’ 
knowledge of storing teeth is inadequate. The most commonly 
mentioned transport medium was a conventional plastic bag, 
but the survival of root surface cells is severely limited by dry-ing out (< 60 minutes). The reason for this common choice could be the ubiquity of plastic bags. Milk was the third most commonly mentioned storage medium and was evaluated  
as sufficient. Cells on the root surfaces survive here for about 
60 minutes. Dry storage and storage in water or saliva were clas-sified as unsatisfactory due to unfavorable osmolarity. Overall, 
significant differences existed between cantons in terms of suitable transport media. All cantons with a high pool/resort 
density more often gave unsatisfactory answers, and 5 cantons 
with a very low number of interviewees largely gave good re-sponses. Thus, most swimming pools/resorts (the type was 
irrelevant) are inadequately informed about the correct storage 
of avulsed teeth. 68 (91.9%) of 74 attendants who had a dental 
first-aid kit used or would have used it in case of an avulsion. If a dental first-aid kit or poster were present, the attendants’ 
answers about transport media were better. The poster too thus 
seems to have an informative effect (Lieger et al. 2009).
The assumption was confirmed, that proportionally more 
injuries occurred at large pools/resorts (i. e., pools with a large number of visitors annually). Such pools are more likely to have waterslides and diving boards, and larger crowds make collisions more frequent. The size of the pool/resort was a decisive factor for the presence of a dental first-aid kit: it was more likely to be present at large pools/resorts. Inexplicably, this was not true of the poster.
Both types of injuries were most frequent in children. One 
reason could be that it is largely children who visit swimming pools/resorts. The results on age groups agree with other stud-ies 
(Nielsen & Freund 2003, Shayegan et al. 2007, Lin et al. 
2008, Fakhruddin et al. 2008).  In contrast, one publication 
show that accidents on waterslides occurred most often among 
14- to 21-year-olds (Malpass et al. 1981).  The fact that adults 
were least involved may be due to their more careful behavior. Lip injuries were approximately equally frequent in both gen-ders. Dental trauma was more common in boys, as confirmed 
in other publications (Otuyemi 1994, Glendor 2000, Lin et al. 
2008, Lin & Naidoo 2008, Yeng & Parashos 2008, Sgan-Cohen 
et al. 2008, Wasmer et al. 2008).  Although girls suffer acci-
dents as frequently as boys, their injuries are less severe. Boys tend to be wilder and more eager to take risks.
Slides are a source of increased risk of facial injuries  (Malpass 
et al. 1981).  According to the pool attendants, most accidents 
happen by climbing up the chute and thus causing collisions. It has been reported that the risk of such accidents on slides 
increases with the number of visitors (Ball 1998),  as confirmed 
by this study. The slide, particularly the waterslide, was the most 
commonly mentioned accident site, which agrees with other authors 
(Mikkelsen et al. 1994).  In the current survey, pools/
resorts with slides had a higher percentage of injuries than those without. Wet floors are also responsible for injuries in the orofacial area. Falls are a common cause of injury at swim-

ming pools/resorts (Nielsen & Freund 2003).  Diving boards 
were the third most frequently reported accident site, particu-larly the 1-meter board. Puddles of water on the boards facili-tate slipping, and the low height entices children to use it in pairs or groups. Using higher diving boards may demand in-creased concentration, or the users are older.
Conclusion: The purpose of the present study was to evalu-
ate the knowledge of pool attendants in terms of lip and tooth 
injuries. It was shown that lip injuries and dental trauma occur 
frequently at Swiss swimming pools/bathing resorts. In addi-tion, the need for information on transport media for avulsed teeth is great. The distribution of dental first-aid kits and den-
tal first-aid posters at Swiss pools/resorts was inadequate at the 
time of the survey. These should be distributed to all pools/resorts in Switzerland, in order to improve the prognosis of accidentally injured teeth. This could also help avoid costly 
post-injury consequences. Suggestions for implementing these 
recommendations have been made in cooperation with the 
Swiss Pool Attendants Association, but they still require refine-
ment and must yet be published in the association’s journal “Bäderrevue” (“Swimming Pool and Bathing Resort Review”).
Résumé
Des accidents dentaires arrivent fréquemment dans les pis-cines. Ils n’ont été étudiés que dans très peu de publications. Le but de cette étude était d’interroger des maîtres-nageurs au sujet de blessures de lèvres et d’accidents dentaires survenus pendant l’année 2007. L’intérêt était, avant tout, de connaître 
les premiers soins prodigués, la fréquence et le lieu de l’acci-dent provoquant des blessures labiales et des accidents den-taires, ainsi que le moyen de conservation des dents avulsées. L’investigation comprenait également la question sur la pré-sence ou l’absence d’une trousse de secours dentaires, ainsi qu’une affiche «accident dentaire» dans les piscines. 606 pis-cines publiques ont été contactées et interrogées. Un maître-nageur par piscine a été interviewé par téléphone. 553 per-sonnes ont participé à cette étude; 53 ont refusé d’y prendre part. Les résultats montrent qu’en 2007, 40% des maîtres-na-geurs ont été témoins d’au moins une blessure aux lèvres, 36,9% d’un accident dentaire. C’est dans les piscines ayant un toboggan, que les accidents ont été les plus fréquents. Les maîtres-nageurs ont donné des réponses satisfaisantes concer-nant leur comportement dans le cas d’une blessure labiale  
ou d’un accident dentaire. 68,7% des réponses concernant  
la conservation des dents avulsées ont été insatisfaisantes.  
74 maîtres-nageurs étaient en possession d’une trousse de se-cours dentaires. 68 des 74 maîtres-nageurs interrogés ont précisé qu’ils utilisaient cette trousse pour conserver les dents avulsées. Seul 59 maîtres-nageurs possédaient l’affiche «acci-dent dentaire». Dans l’ensemble, on a pu constater que les maîtres-nageurs en possession d’une trousse de secours den-taires et de l’affiche «accident dentaire» ont donné de meil-leures réponses concernant leur comportement lors de trau-matismes dentaires.
