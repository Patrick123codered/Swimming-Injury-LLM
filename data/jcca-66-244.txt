The authors have no disclaimers, competing interests, or sources of support or funding to report in the preparation of this manuscript.Background: Shoulder problems are common in 
swimmers. Previous research has focused on elite 
swimmers. Our research questions were: 1) what is the 
prevalence of shoulder problems among Ontario age 
group swimmers and 2) how does prevalence relate to 
age, sex and years of experience?  
 Methods: A cross sectional survey was administered 
to youth swimmers from two Ontario clubs. Oslo Sports 
Trauma Research Centre Overuse Injury Questionnaire 
(OSTRC) was used to assess four-week prevalence of 
shoulder problems. Prevalence (%) with 95% confidence 
intervals (95% CI) was constructed and prevalence 
across age, sex and years of experience was investigated 
using cross-tabulations and chi-square tests. 
 Results: There were 83 surveys completed (response 
rate 50%). The 4-week prevalence of shoulder pain was Prévalence des problèmes à l’épaule chez les jeunes 
nageurs de l’Ontario  
Contexte : Les problèmes à l’épaule sont courants chez 
les nageurs. Les recherches antérieures ont porté sur les 
nageurs d’élite. Nos questions de recherche étaient les 
suivantes : 1) quelle est la prévalence des problèmes à 
l’épaule chez les nageurs des groupes d’âge de l’Ontario 
et 2) comment la prévalence est-elle liée à l’âge, au sexe 
et aux années d’expérience?  
 Méthodologie : Une enquête transversale a été menée 
auprès des jeunes nageurs de deux clubs de l’Ontario. 
Le questionnaire sur les blessures de surmenage de 
l’Oslo Sports Trauma Research Centre (OSTRC) a 
été utilisé pour évaluer la prévalence des problèmes à 
l’épaule sur quatre semaines. La prévalence  (%) avec 
des intervalles de confiance à 95 % (IC 95 %) a été 
établie et la prévalence en fonction de l’âge, du sexe 
et des années d’expérience a été étudiée à l’aide de 
tableaux croisés et de tests du chi carré.  
 Résultats : L’enquête a obtenu un taux de réponse de 
50 % (83 questionnaires remplis). La prévalence des

Introduction
Swimming has continued to gain interest in Canada as a 
competitive sport in part due to the success of the Can-
adian 2016 Olympic swim team, with a total of 63,484 
swimmers registered in Canada in 2019.1 Age-group 
swimmers (under 18 years old) make up the majority of 
these athletes with a total of 33,599 swimmers registered 
in Canada in 2019.1 Swimming Canada’s Long Term Ath-
lete Development (LTAD) plan has a goal to keep youth 
active in sport for life with an emphasis on development.2,3 
Appropriate athlete development aims to develop skills 
and performance while reducing the potential for injury to 
keep youth safe and able to continue participation. Most 
evidence on the prevalence of musculoskeletal concerns 
in swimmers has focussed on those at the elite level, with 
much less being known about the prevalence of muscu-
loskeletal concerns in developing age-group swimmers.
 The shoulder joint has been reported as the most com-
mon site of injury in competitive swimmers in different 
age groups, levels and data collection environments (i.e. 
practice or competition).4-9 Studies conducted at cham -
pionship meets found four-week shoulder injury preva-
lence of 13% at the 2015 Fédération Internationale de 
Natation (FINA) World Championships4 while at the 
Brazilian National Championship meet, shoulder injury 
point prevalence was 9% and 12-month shoulder injury 
prevalence was 26%4,5. Studies conducted at competitions 
miss swimmers who are injured and unable to attend the 
meet due to their injuries. This highlights the importance 
of out of competition studies.4 Two studies looked at in-
jury incidence during the season among National Collegi -ate Athletic Association (NCAA) swimmers in the U.S. 
and found shoulder injuries comprised 35% to 46% of the 
total injuries in men and 31% to 33% of the total injuries 
in women.6, 7
 Most studies of shoulder pain and injuries have been 
conducted in the elite swimmer population. Recognizing 
that the majority of competitive swimmers are in the age-
group category, understanding prevalence in age-group 
swimmers is necessary to better understand how to pro-
vide safe programs. Two studies have reported on shoul-
der problems in age-group swimmers. A study on Austral-
ian swimmers followed athletes for 12 months and found 
overall significant shoulder pain incidence was 38%.10 
A cross sectional study collected data during practice 
from Italian swimmers and determined the prevalence of 
shoulder pain over 12 months was 51%.11 Understanding 
prevalence of shoulder problems in Canadian swimmers 
is the first step to inform education of coaches and pro-
grams, and ultimately to ensure safe sport.
 In a recent systematic review, Hill and colleagues12 
identified, critically appraised and synthesized the lit-
erature on potential risk factors for shoulder injuries in 
swimmers. The factors studied included demographics 
(e.g., sex, age, competitive level, years of experience), 
shoulder joint anatomy and strength measures (e.g., 
range of motion, strength, muscle activity, flexibility), 
activity related factors (e.g., equipment use, training 
volume, stroke speciality, breathing side) and musculo-
skeletal anatomy (e.g., scapular kinematics, core stabil-
ity, pectoral length).12 Some of the training-related risk 
factors in the review are modifiable by the coach and can 
246 J Can Chiropr Assoc 2022; 66(3)Prevalence of shoulder problems in youth swimmers in Ontario
potentially prevent shoulder pain or injuries if the need 
for prevention exists. However, based on their critical 
appraisal of the studies found, no risk factors had a high 
level of certainty. There was a moderate level of certainty 
for joint laxity, internal/external rotation, previous shoul-
der pain and competitive level posing a risk. All remain-
ing factors they considered had a low level of certainty 
as risk factors for shoulder pain and injury in swimmers. 
That is, there is insufficient high-quality evidence to sup-
port or refute which of these potential factors (years of 
experience, training load, volume, intensity, gender, age, 
equipment, breathing side, scapular strength, core stabil-
ity, pectoral length etc.) are indeed risk factors for shoul-
der injury.
 A goal of Swimming Canada is to provide safe sport to 
athletes.1 Safe sport is ensuring the physical and mental 
well-being of athletes, including preventing injury. The 
Long Term Athlete Development (LTAD) model has the 
goal to keep athletes active in sport for life, develop elite 
athletes and develop physical literacy.13 LTAD provides a 
framework based on growth, maturation, trainability, and 
sports systems to emphasize the development of skills in-
stead of winning, to prevent overtraining, burn out and 
lost potential.2,14 Overuse injuries are a common reason 
for athletes to drop out of sport.15 Therefore, to make sport 
safe, understanding prevalence and risk factors is neces-
sary.
 The primary objective of our study was to determine 
the four-week period prevalence of shoulder problems 
among Ontario age-group swimmers. The secondary 
objective was to determine if prevalence varies by age 
group, sex and years of swimming experience.
Methods
Study design
This was a cross sectional survey administered in Decem -
ber 2020 to age-group swimmers in Ontario. The study 
was reviewed and received approval by the Canadian 
Memorial Chiropractic College (CMCC) Research Ethics 
Board (REB) (REB #2004B02).
Participants and recruitment
Three Ontario swim clubs originally agreed to partici -
pate. Inclusion criteria were: 12 to 18 years old competi -
tive swimmers, from one of the three clubs, who had been training for at least 10 to 12 weeks at time of survey ad-
ministration. Demographics of this population included 
approximately equal numbers of boys and girls, middle 
to upper class socioeconomic status, mixed ethnicities, 
and following Swim Canada LTAD. The original plan 
for recruitment and administration was for the study pri-
mary investigator (PI) to attend regular swim practices 
for each swim group from the participating clubs, explain 
the study, answer any questions, recruit swimmers and 
administer the questionnaire at practice using paper and 
pencil administration. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, 
an amendment to the protocol was made to administer 
the survey online using SurveyMonkey (SurveyMonkey 
Inc., San Mateo, California, USA. www.surveymonkey.
com). Swimmers were recruited during a training session 
which was being conducted remotely at the time of sur -
vey administration. Remote practices began 14 days prior 
to survey administration, but all recruited swimmers had 
been participating in in-water training for at least 10 to 
12 weeks prior to survey administration. Parents provid-
ed consent and swimmers provided assent at the time of 
survey administration and the swimmers were prompted 
to continue to the online survey after assenting to par -
ticipate. The link was emailed to swimmers post-Zoom 
practice for any swimmer interested in participating, but 
unable to get parental consent at the time of the Zoom 
session. A post practice reminder email was sent from the 
coaches two days after initial data collection, and a final 
reminder was sent seven days from the initial data col-
lection. The SurveyMonkey link remained open for four 
weeks.
Sample size and response rate goal
Initially a total of 300 eligible swimmers were potential 
participants from the three participating clubs. Our goal 
was to recruit 70% of these eligible swimmers, which 
would provide 210 respondents. Shoulder problem preva-
lence estimation was 20%, based on the study conducted 
at the Word Championships.4 The confidence interval 
width for an estimated 20% four-week period prevalence 
of shoulder problems with 210 respondents would have 
been +/- 5.4% .
Survey instrument
The primary outcome measure was shoulder problem 
prevalence in the past four weeks. A shoulder problem 
J Can Chiropr Assoc 2022; 66(3) 247T Ostrander, C DeGraauw, SJ Howarth, S Hogg-Johnson
was defined as pain or a diagnosed injury. The Oslo Sports 
Trauma Research Centre (OSTRC) questionnaire was 
used because the questions were simple, the questionnaire 
had been validated, and a previous study on injury preva-
lence in swimmers used the same questionnaire (Table 
1).4,16 Four questions from the OSTRC questionnaire as-sessed four aspects of shoulder problems covering pain, 
participation impact, performance impact, and training 
volume impact over the previous four weeks (questions 8 
to 11 in Table 1). The period of four weeks was selected 
to keep consistent with the study that used the OSTRC 
questionnaire at the World Championships.8

Data preparation and analysis
Data extracted from SurveyMonkey was indexed by a 
study identification number and stored on a secured pass-
word protected server located at Canadian Memorial 
Chiropractic College (CMCC). Prevalence of shoulder 
problems from each of the four OSTRC questions was 
described as a percentage with a 95% confidence inter -
val (CI). Variation in prevalence for each question was 
examined by age group, sex and years of experience with 
cross-tabulations and chi-square test statistics. Chi-square 
tests with a p-value < 0.05 were considered statistically 
significant. The analysis of the study was generated using 
SAS software v9.4. (Copyright © 2012-2018, SAS Insti-
tute Inc., Cary, NC, USA. SAS and all other SAS Institute 
Inc. product or service names are registered trademarks 
or trademarks of SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA.) To 
evaluate non-responder bias age, sex and swim group data 
was collected and compared to the responder characteris -
tics.
Results
Three clubs initially agreed to participate (n=300), but 
due to the COVID-19 pandemic only two clubs were able 
to participate (n=166) and parental consent was given for 
90 swimmers to participate. Swimmer assent was provid-
ed by 86 swimmers, two swimmers completed the assent 
but did not complete the full survey, with one of these 
swimmers completing only one question. The completed 
survey response rate was 50% (n=83/166).
 Table 2 describes the survey respondents by age 
group, sex, swim experience, stroke, consent, assent 
and responses to all four questions from the OSTRC. 
Approximately equal number of subjects were female 
(n=44/84) and male (n=40/84). Almost half (44%) of the 
swimmers had three to five years of experience. The total 
number of swimmers in each age group decreased as the 
age of the swimmers increased.
 The prevalence of any shoulder pain was 35% (95% CI 
25%, 45%) based on answering question number eleven 
in Table 1. The prevalence of participation impact was 
33 % (95% CI 22%, 42%) based on answering question 
number eight in Table 1. The prevalence of performance 
impact was 36 % (95% CI 25%, 45%) based on answers 
to question number ten in Table 1. The prevalence of vol-
ume impact was 23 % (95% CI 14%, 32%) based on an-
swers to question number nine in Table 1. Table 3 presents cross tabulations of shoulder problem 
prevalence by age group, sex, and swim experience to 
compare prevalence for all four OSTRC questions. Based 
on the chi-square statistics reported, there were no sta-
tistically significant relationships between prevalence of 
shoulder problems and age, sex or years of experience. 
However, the following orders were seen in the data, but 
not found to be statistically significant. The prevalence 
was highest for all four questions in the 12 and under age 
group followed by the 13 to 14 age group for three ques-

tions (pain, performance impacted and volume impacted 
questions). Prevalence for all four measures of shoulder 
problems was higher in females than males. Prevalence of 
pain, participation impact and volume impact was highest 
in the swimmers with three to five years of experience 
and performance impact was highest for swimmers with 
seven to 10 years of experience.
Discussion
The purpose of our study was to understand shoulder 
problem prevalence among age-group swimmers in On-
tario. The OSTRC questionnaire was used to determine 
the prevalence of shoulder pain and impact on participa -
tion, performance, and training volume. Two swim clubs 
participated and the response rate was 51%. The overall 
prevalence of shoulder pain was 35%. The prevalence 
was highest in females and in the 12 and under age group 
for all four types of shoulder problems.
 The overall prevalence of shoulder pain in the current 
study is similar to a study on age-group swimmers from 
Australia that found 12-month prevalence of shoulder 
pain was 38%.10 However, the overall period prevalence 
of shoulder pain in our study was lower compared to an-
other study on age-group swimmers that found 51% of 
athletes had shoulder pain in the past 12 months.11 A pos-
sible explanation to the discrepancy between Tessaro et 
al.11 and our findings is the time period of prevalence was 
longer in Tessaro et al.11 and therefore it is reasonable that 
the prevalence percentage was higher. The prevalence of 
shoulder problem impact on participation, performance, 
training volume and pain was higher among females than 
males which is consistent with findings in a study by Kerr 
et al. 20156 and Tessaro et al.11. The relationship of higher 
prevalence in females compared to males was not statis-
tically significant in our study and this agrees with other 
studies that found sex was not a risk factor for shoulder 
pain/injury.7,17 Prevalence among age groups was highest 
in the 12 and under group and decreased as the age in-
creased for three questions (performance impact, partici -
pation impact and pain). Tessaro et al.11 found the oppos-
ite trend with pain prevalence highest in the males 17 to 
18 and females 15 to 16 years old followed by the males 
12 to 13 and females 11 to 12 years old. Overall, our study 
did not find a statistically significant relationship between 
age group and shoulder problems. Other studies had sim-
ilar results and found shoulder pain/injury was not sig-nificantly different among different age groups indicating 
age was not considered a risk factor.7,10,11,18
 The total number of swimmers in each age group de-
creased as age increased which suggests that athletes leave 
the sport as they get older, leading to the question of why 
the swimmers leave and where they go. Various reasons 
may lead to youth dropping out of sport. If athletes drop 
out of swimming due to shoulder pain, it is necessary to 
understand in order to make the sport safer. Shoulder pain/
injuries that were incurred through swimming might limit 
the athlete’s ability to take part in not only swimming, but 
other sports and activities involving overhead arm move-
ment in the future. Injuries, specifically repetitive over -
use injuries, have been reported as a common cause of 
drop out from sport.15 The results reported here, showing 
smaller numbers of swimmers in older age groups sug-
gests that research looking at reasons for dropping out are 
warranted in order to understand the relationship between 
shoulder problems and dropping out.
 Sport for Life Long Term Athlete Development in 
Sports and Physical Activity (LTADS) was adopted by 
Swimming Canada which to developed into the Appro-
priate Athlete Development (AAD) and the Athlete De-
velopment Matrix (ADM). The AAD and the ADM was 
developed to assist coaches, clubs and other personal 
involved in swimming to develop and deliver stage ap-
propriate programs.3 The goal of AAD is to provide a 
framework for athlete development based on growth, 
maturation trainability, and sports system alignment.2 The 
goal of these models is to keep children active in sport for 
life, develop elite athletes and develop physical literacy.13 
A study of swim coaches in Portugal found that 67% of 
the coaches were aware of the LTAD.19 The awareness of 
the AAD and AMD among Canadian coaches is unknown 
and worth investigating to improve safety in sport. The 
results of this study on shoulder problem prevalence illus-
trates a need for understanding long term prevalence and 
injury prevention strategies to make swimming safer.
Limitations
The main limitation of this study was the number of par -
ticipants. Originally, the study was intended to sample 
from 300 swimmers from three swim clubs, but due to the 
COVID-19 pandemic we were only able to collect data 
from two swim clubs. Moreover, many swimmers were 
not able to train, which resulted in a decreased number of 
J Can Chiropr Assoc 2022; 66(3) 251T Ostrander, C DeGraauw, SJ Howarth, S Hogg-Johnson
athletes in the sampling frame. In addition, the sampling 
frame was not representative of all age-group swimmers 
because only swimmers from the highest competitive 
groups were swimming during COVID-19 restrictions. 
The original target population included a variety of com-
petitive levels. Collectively, these limitations affected 
our total number of responses, which resulted in a wider 
margin of error around the prevalence estimate than ori-
ginally planned. Despite these limitations, our response 
rate was similar to the previous FINA study that used the 
same survey and study period.4 Future work should aim 
to replicate the findings of the current study with a larger 
sample and consider including swimmers from a variety 
of competitive levels.
 Another limitation was the inability to confirm if the 
survey was completed by the swimmer or the parent due 
to the survey being online. The original study design of in 
person data collection would have confirmed the swim-
mer completed the survey. One possible source of bias 
that was difficult to overcome was if a swimmer was ab-
sent from the online Zoom practice because of shoulder 
problems.
 A limitation of the survey tool was all questions (#8 to 
10) were asked to the swimmer regardless of their answer 
to pain prevalence (#11). This meant there was not a focus 
of modifications to training in the presence of pain alone.
 Swimmers had not been training regularly from March 
to September 2020 due to COVID-19. The swimmers 
were undertrained when returning to swim training in 
September 2020 compared to a normal start of the season, 
which could have affected the overall number of shoul-
der problems present. The absence from regular train -
ing could have over-represented prevalence of shoulder 
problems because the swimmers were more undertrained. 
Conversely, the prolonged period away from pool train -
ing could have also under-represented the shoulder prob-
lems due to allowing previous shoulder problems to fully 
heal from the rest.
 A final limitation is the study design. The purpose 
was not to delve into what aspect(s) of participation in 
swimming might explain why some athletes experienced 
shoulder problems/pain. Several explanatory factors have 
been explored, which can be grouped under the following 
categories: shoulder anatomy and physiology (e.g., pec-
toral length, joint laxity, downward sloping acromion), 
training (e.g., volume, intensity, stroke/distance specialty, use of equipment such as hand paddles), mechanics and 
technique (e.g., breathing side) and personal (e.g., years 
experience, age, sex, history of shoulder pain).10,11,12,17,18 
Our study’s results on prevalence of shoulder problems 
in age group swimmers identifies that a problem exists. 
Future research with a different design (e.g., longitudin -
al follow-up of swimmers) and data collection (including 
some of the factors listed above) would be required to 
identify causative factors for shoulder problems in age 
group swimmers to provide better information for identi -
fying risk mitigation strategies.
Conclusion
Sport has many positive aspects and physical activity for 
life is one of the goals of the LTAD. Understanding the 
prevalence of shoulder problems in age-group swimmers 
allows for future studies to investigate strategies to pre-
vent shoulder pain/injuries. Strategies to prevent shoulder 
problems should start from the national organization and 
inform the provincial and local organizations on methods 
to keep sport safe for all swimmers.
