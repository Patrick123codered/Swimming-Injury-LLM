There were an average of 73 cases per year of death by drowning 
in Singapore between 1965 and 2005.(1) Drowning rates ranged 
from 0.88 to 1.72 per 100,000 from 1992 to 2001,(2) and 
decreased to 0.39 and 0.18 per 100,000 in 2012 and 2013, 
respectively.(3) This is comparable to the drowning rates in 
other high-income countries such as Australia, Sweden and the 
United Kingdom.(4) Nevertheless, drowning prevention continues 
to be a relevant concern, as a large number of people, mostly 
children, go swimming in Singapore’s equatorial climate. Based 
on reports by the Singapore Life Saving Society (SLSS), 117 cases 
of death by drowning were heard in the Coroner’s Court during the 
period 2012–2014.(5) Of these, 19 took place in swimming pools. 
(Note: the annual reports of the SLSS are not primary sources of 
data. Data derived from the Coroner’s Court is based on cases 
where drowning was mentioned or suspected for the coroner’s 
inquiries with pending verdicts and pronounced verdicts, and 
do not tally exactly with figures from the Registry of Births and 
Deaths, which exclude instances of assault, self-harm and death 
from other causes in cases classified as accidental drowning.)
In 2014, there was an attendance of 6,870,183 at swimming 
pools operated by the Singapore Sports Council (SSC).(6) 
Swimming was the second most popular sport in the 2011 
National Sports Participation Survey and the top sport that children aged ≤ 12 years engaged in outside of school.(7) The 
need to review drowning safety in swimming pools is especially 
pertinent given the increase in the number of swimming pools in 
the country. The National Environment Agency reported that there 
were 1,889 swimming pool licences in force in 2012, an increase 
from 1,772 in 2011.(8) This figure applies to pools operated by the 
SSC, school campuses, hotels and condominiums, but does not 
include landed home pools, which do not require a licence.(9) 
The number of such pools in Singapore is unknown but likely 
to be on the rise.
The aim of the present study was to conduct a descriptive 
analysis of the national ambulance case records, so as to make 
practical safety recommendations to reduce the danger of 
drowning incidents in swimming pools. We postulated that a 
higher rate of bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) 
might occur in the presence of a lifeguard. A literature review 
showed that no similar study has previously been published in 
Singapore.
METHODS
A categorical and free text search was performed of a national 
electronic database of descriptive summaries by first-responder 
paramedics of all 995 calls made to the Singapore Civil Defence 
Force (SCDF) between 1 January 2012 and 31 December 2014. Drowning in swimming pools: clinical features

INTRODUCTION This study was a descriptive analysis of national ambulance case records and aimed to make practical 
safety recommendations in order to reduce the incidence of drowning in swimming pools.
METHODS A search was performed of a national database of descriptive summaries by first-responder paramedics of 
all 995 calls made to the Singapore Civil Defence Force between 1 January 2012 and 31 December 2014. We included 
all cases of submersion in both public and private pools for which emergency medical services were activated.
RESULTS The highest proportion of drowning cases occurred in the age group of 0–9 years. Males accounted for 57.0% 
(61/107) of cases. Bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was performed in 91.3% (21/23) and 68.6% (48/70) 
of cases of cardiac/respiratory arrest from drowning in public and private pools, respectively; the rate of bystander CPR 
was higher when a lifeguard was present (88.5%, 23/26 vs. 68.7%, 46/67). The majority (72.0%, 77/107) of drowning 
incidents occurred in private pools, most of which had no lifeguards present.
CONCLUSION To our knowledge, this study was the first in Singapore to examine data from emergency medical services. 
Since the majority of incidents occurred in private pools without lifeguards, it is recommended that a lifeguard be present 
at every pool. For pools that are too small to justify mandatory lifeguard presence, safety measures, such as guidelines for 
pool design and pool fencing with latched gates, may be considered. As strict enforcement may not be possible, public 
education and parental vigilance remain vital.
Keywords: accident prevention, drowning, prehospital emergency care, public health, swimming pools
Original Article45The purpose was to identify all likely cases of drowning in both 
public and private pools for which emergency medical services 
were activated. These summaries had originally been written 
freehand on paper by paramedics who had conveyed patients to 
hospital or pronounced them dead at the scene. The summaries 
were then transcribed by the paramedics and archived in an 
electronic database. Institutional review board approval and 
waiver of consent were obtained for this study.
We included all cases of submersion in swimming pools 
for which the SCDF was called during the study period. We 
understood drowning as referring to all cases of submersion 
injury regardless of whether death occurred, in accordance 
with the uniform reporting guidelines proposed by Idris et al.(10) 
Cases in which the patient lost consciousness in the water due 
to another cause but was at risk of submersion injury were also 
included. For the purpose of this study, swimming pools run 
by the SSC and those located in public educational institutions 
were referred to as ‘public pools’, and swimming pools in private 
housing (condominiums and landed homes) and hotel or leisure 
facilities were referred to as ‘private pools’. We excluded all cases 
of submersion injury that did not take place at a swimming pool. 
After a free text review, we further excluded cases that involved 
illness without submersion (e.g. partial seizure while standing in 
water), or cases in which the victim was pronounced dead at the 
scene after a presumably long period of submersion and it was 
unclear if the death was a result of submersion or due to foul play.
Data gathered for each incident included information on 
age, gender, lifeguard presence, performance of bystander CPR, 
use of an automated external defibrillator (AED) and clinical 
features. A lifeguard was taken to be present if the paramedic’s 
summary explicitly stated the presence of a lifeguard or swimming 
instructor. The mention of ‘staff’ or ‘security personnel’ performing 
CPR was not regarded as lifeguard presence.
The victims were identified as having a cardiac arrest if they 
were described as pulseless. If they were described as apnoeic 
or unconscious after submersion, with or without documented 
cyanosis, they were deemed to have suffered a respiratory arrest. 
Additional features of the case (such as whether the submersion 
was witnessed) were noted if they had been documented by 
paramedics.
RESULTS
A total of 107 drowning cases were identified in our search, 
with 77 (72.0%) occurring in private pools ( Fig. 1). Drowning 
most frequently occurred in the age group of 0–9 years (42.1%, 
45/107). A further 26.2% (28/107) of drowning cases involved 
adults aged ≥ 40 years ( Table  I). Seven cases involved children 
aged 2–6 years who were not swimming but slipped or were 
pushed into the pool. Of the seven cases, six occurred in private 
pools. In one case, a toddler had wandered off from a poolside 
family function and fallen into the pool. Another case involved 
an infant left unattended for 30 seconds in a home baby pool.
The clinical features of the cases are described in Table  II. 
There were 24 (22.4%) cases of cardiac arrest without return of 
spontaneous circulation (ROSC). In two of these cases, it was unclear whether there was a preceding medical event: one adult 
felt giddy and collapsed in the baby pool prior to submersion, 
while another, with bruises on the forehead, was pulled out after 
the unwitnessed event. Three victims lost consciousness due to 
reasons other than drowning: seizure in two adults aged 28 years 
and 38 years, and trauma in a ten-year-old child who jumped from 
height into the pool. Other clinical features were documented 
by the paramedics for 80 of the 107 cases, of which 50 (62.5%) 
were reported to be unwitnessed at the moment of drowning and 
the victims were found unresponsive. In ten cases, the period in 
which the victim was unsupervised was documented as ranging 
from less than 30 seconds to 45 minutes.
The presence of a lifeguard was documented in 33 out of 
107 cases (30.8%; Fig. 2). Among these drowning incidents with 
lifeguard presence, the majority (78.8%, 26/33) took place in 
public pools. Lifeguard involvement in rescue or resuscitation 
was noted in 26 (86.7%) of the 30 cases of drowning in public 
pools, whereas lifeguard presence was not documented in 
90.9% (70/77) cases of drowning in private pools. In public and 
private pools, respectively, there were 23 cases and 70 cases of 
cardiac or respiratory arrest from drowning. Bystander CPR was Table I. Age and gender of persons who drowned (n = 107).

Original Article46performed in 91.3% (n = 21) of the cases in public pools and in 
68.6% (n = 48) of the cases in private pools. In cases of cardiac 
or respiratory arrest from drowning, the overall rate of bystander 
CPR was 74.2% (69/93), and the rate of bystander CPR was 
88.5% (23/26) in the presence of a lifeguard and 68.7% (46/67) 
in the absence of a lifeguard. In four cases, the patients regained 
consciousness with rescue breaths alone.
In cases where lifeguard presence was not documented, the 
patients were less likely to receive CPR ( Fig. 3). No bystander CPR 
occurred in four cases of cardiac arrest without prehospital ROSC 
(Fig. 4). In two of these cases, the patients were pronounced dead 
at the scene. It was mentioned in seven cases that an AED was 
applied prior to the arrival of the ambulance. In six out of these 
seven cases, AED use was initiated by a lifeguard at a public pool. 
In the one remaining case, the AED was operated by a doctor at 
a private hotel pool. In four out of seven cases, the rhythm was 
shockable and one or more shocks were delivered prior to the 
arrival of an ambulance; one such patient experienced prehospital 
ROSC. In two cases where an AED was not used, shocks were 
delivered by paramedics after the arrival of the ambulance, but 
this did not result in prehospital ROSC.
In five cases, the drowning victims were reported to be non-
swimmers, and in another, the victim was a former competitive 
swimmer. In two adult cases, alcohol use by the victims prior to 
drowning was documented by paramedics.DISCUSSION
This is the first local study to examine data from emergency 
medical services. There were 19 swimming pool deaths by 
drowning heard in the Coroner’s Court during our study 
period – four in public pools and 15 in private pools,(5) although 
the SCDF was activated for 107 swimming pool drowning 
incidents during this period.
The present study confirmed our hypothesis that the rate 
of bystander CPR is higher in the presence of a lifeguard. It 
is worrisome that the majority (77 of 107 cases) of drowning 
incidents attended to by the SCDF occurred in private pools, most 
of which do not have lifeguards. A lifeguard was documented to 
be present in only 9.1% of drowning cases in private pools, as 
compared to 86.7% of cases in public pools. We postulate that 
lifeguard presence may improve response time to a drowning 
incident, shorten the time taken to initiate CPR and provide good 
quality CPR by trained personnel. In a paediatric study, Kyriacou 
et al reported that children who experienced drowning with a 
good outcome were 4.75 times (adjusted odds ratio) more likely to 
have experienced immediate resuscitation than children with poor 
outcomes (95% confidence interval 3.44–6.06; p = 0.0001).(11) 
Conversely, when CPR is delayed, of inferior quality or not 
initiated, there is a danger of poor clinical outcomes. In the 
present study, bystander CPR for cardiac or respiratory arrest 
from drowning was performed in a higher percentage of cases 1061430 28

Original Article47in public pools compared to private pools, which may be due to 
greater lifeguard presence in the former.
Interestingly, we found that even when no lifeguard was 
present, the incidence of bystander CPR in our study was more 
than three times higher than that of general bystander CPR 
previously reported in Singapore (15%–23%).(12) We hypothesise 
that the reasons for this, while unclear, include the influence 
of media (e.g. television) on public perception of what to do in 
a drowning case and the high number of paediatric cases, in 
which distaste on the part of the public to perform mouth-to-
mouth resuscitation on a stranger may present less of a barrier. 
Nevertheless, patients with respiratory arrest were more likely to 
be conscious at the scene. We postulate that many of them who 
did not receive bystander CPR may have regained consciousness 
before CPR could be initiated.
Drowning incidents in private pools have recently come 
under the spotlight due to an apparent increase in childhood 
drowning incidents. Recent data from a study done at KK 
Women’s and Children’s Hospital, Singapore, showed that 69 
out of 104 drowning incidents involving children between 2011 
and 2015 took place in private pools. Of these, ten children died 
and two suffered irreversible brain injury. The hospital saw an 
average of 20 cases of drowning per year during the five-year 
period – an increase from a rate of 1–14 cases annually from 
2005 to 2010.(13)
Previous local studies have highlighted that private pools are 
likely to lack lifeguard supervision, despite lifeguard supervision 
having been associated with a reduction in drowning incidents.(2) 
In an emergency department case series, 11 out of 17 drowning 
incidents occurred in swimming pools, and CPR was delayed 
or absent for two patients who drowned in private pools, one 
of whom suffered hypoxic brain injury.(14) Also, according to the 
Childhood Injury Surveillance Project, 11 out of 20 swimming 
pool drowning incidents in children occurred in private pools 
during the period of 2002–2004.(15) In a separate local review of 
injuries in children attending the emergency department, most 
of the swimming pool near-drowning cases and one of the two 
drowning deaths involved private pools.(16)
In the present study, the age group of 0–9 years accounted 
for the highest proportion of drowning cases, which underscores 
the need for close parental supervision of children in this age 
group. About 20% of incidents in our study involved children 
under five years of age. Drowning fatalities in this age group are 
the highest worldwide and most often associated with swimming 
pools,(4) although these children are also at risk from drowning 
at home.(4,13-16) 26.2% of the cases in the present study involved 
victims aged 40 years and above, for whom comorbidities or 
unexpected medical events may have precipitated drowning 
and become a consideration in management. In two cases, the 
drowning was precipitated by seizures. In several adult cardiac 
arrest cases, it was unclear if there was a preceding medical 
event causing collapse while the patients were swimming. This 
is a useful reminder for first responders and clinicians involved 
in the care of drowning cases to look for precipitating medical 
events in all drowning cases.Drowning prevention strategies worldwide can be classified 
into four broad categories: environmental modification; 
education and skills; legislation and standards; and immediate 
resuscitation.(2,4,15,17-19) The World Health Organization and the 
American Academy of Pediatrics place the greatest emphasis 
on pool fencing, ‘touch’ supervision by a parent within arm’s 
length for infants and toddlers, and the availability of CPR-
trained personnel at the scene, in view of the short window of 
opportunity for rescue intervention.(4,20) While there have been 
no formal studies evaluating the effectiveness of lifeguards in 
the prevention of drowning, before-and-after data on rescue and 
resuscitation in the United States (US) suggested that supervision 
by lifeguards saves lives and lowers drowning rates.(21) Besides 
rescue, lifeguards also play a role in surveillance and prevention, 
and a lifeguard trained in CPR can aid in immediate resuscitation 
measures at the scene.
In our local setting, the National Water Safety Council has 
previously urged lifeguard attendance at private pools.(22,23) While 
there should ideally be a lifeguard in attendance at every pool, it 
may not be practical or cost-effective to provide a lifeguard in the 
setting of a pool in a landed home or a small shared facility with 
a low volume of swimmers. A logical first step may be to formally 
define the characteristics of a pool that requires a lifeguard, 
decide what constitutes proper lifeguard training and mandate 
lifeguard presence at such pools. In addition, in premises that 
lack lifeguards, a practical step would be to train security officers 
on the use of CPR and AED so that there are trained personnel 
to render immediate resuscitative assistance at the scene should 
a drowning incident occur.
It is currently not required by the law for operators of 
swimming pools to enforce lifeguard presence. However, in the 
case of BNM v. National University of Singapore  [2014] SGHC 
5, the Singapore High Court decided that owners or operators of 
at least standard Olympic-sized pools may owe a duty to users 
of the pool to provide properly trained lifeguards.(24) Likewise, 
there is currently no legislation to enforce safety standards in pool 
design. The Singapore Standard (SS) 556: 2010 Code of Practice 
for the maintenance and design of aquatic facilities was launched 
in 2010 with the aim of minimising swimming injury and 
preventable drowning incidents.(25) However, compliance with the 
SS 556 is not mandatory but dependent on the conscientiousness 
of industry players.
Other safety measures could be considered in pools that are 
too infrequently used to justify mandatory lifeguard presence. 
Medical professionals and building managers in Singapore have 
issued calls for legislation of pool design and pool fencing.(13-15) 
While rigorous studies with high-level evidence are lacking,(26) 
there is empiric evidence from the US, Australia and New 
Zealand of the protective effect of pool fencing against childhood 
drowning, particularly in the age group of 0–4 years.(27-33) 
Legislation for pool fencing has also been shown to decrease 
drowning deaths,(34-36) although not to the extent that might 
be anticipated, likely due to inadequate enforcement.(37-39) As 
landed home pools become more prevalent here, pool fencing 
to prevent unattended children from wandering into a home pool 
Original Article48may become an increasingly relevant topic for discussion in the 
local context.(15,20) As home pools are currently not subject to any 
safety standards or auditing process, a standard advice package 
highlighting drowning prevention measures could be provided 
to owners of home pools upon their creation, and these owners 
should be encouraged to learn CPR. Likewise, public education 
packages can also be given to buyers of infla table  pools and 
pool equipment.
The present study was not without limitations. Firstly, it was 
a simple retrospective database search. The cases in our review 
were found if they contained the relevant keywords or if data in 
the available categories (e.g. location) suggested a swimming pool 
drowning incident. Thus, we might have missed cases that could 
not be found based on free-text searches or categorical searches. 
As such, the incidence of drowning cases reported in this review 
may be an underestimation of the true number. Cases for which 
SCDF ambulances were not called were not represented in this 
review and we did not follow up on hospital outcomes. Lastly, 
there is no national standard for data collection to examine the 
causes of drowning, and the retrospective data record analysis has 
limitations in elucidating the causal factors that lead to drowning. 
Such requirements can be considered for future trauma database 
collection and data analysis to enable more systematic research 
on the causes of drowning.
In conclusion, public education remains vital in reducing 
drowning in swimming pools. Regardless of age or experience, 
even trained swimmers should be discouraged from swimming 
alone. Adults should refrain from going near any body of water 
if intoxicated or feeling unwell. Infants and young children who 
are not water-safe should be under continuous adult supervision 
when they are around swimming pools.(3,4,15,16) Parental vigilance 
applies equally to children attending a poolside function and 
those with the intention to swim.
