Abstract .Objective: To compare knee extension- ﬂexion isokinetic performance between elite swimmers of simultaneous (SS –
butter ﬂy and breaststroke) and alternated swimming (AS – front crawl and backstroke) styles.
Method: Nineteen short distance elite swimmers (50 m, 100 m and 200 m events), divided into SS ( n=7; 23.3 ±5.6 years) and
AS (n=12; 22.6 ±1.4 years) were tested for knee extension- ﬂexion isokinetic strength at 60◦/s (4 repetitions) and endurance
at 300◦/s (30 repetitions).
Results: There were no signi ﬁcant differences between groups or legs for concentric knee extension and ﬂexion variables.
However, the agonist/antagonist (HQ) ratio was lower ( p=0.032) in AS than SS group for both legs.
Conclusion: These results indicate the need for training programs to imp rove strength balance between hamstrings and quadriceps
muscles in short distance elite swimmers.
Keywords: Isokinetic evaluation, knee, muscle strength, swimming
1. Introduction
Swimming performance depends on optimizing
propulsion and minimizing the opposing factors [1].Muscle power and endurance are among the main fac-
tors that contribute to maximizing propulsion [2,3]. In
this context, the shoulder complex has been previous-ly studied, in relation to muscle performance [4], itsbiomechanics [5] and injury incidence [6].
Although the repetitive and continuous knee ﬂexion
and extension is also important for swimming propul-sion, knee muscles performance have rarely been ex-
amined among swimmers [1,7,8]. Moreover, there is
no study to date comparing knee muscles performanceamong elite swimmers of different styles.

to compare knee extension- ﬂexion isokinetic perfor-
mance between elite swimmers of simultaneous styles(SS – butter ﬂy and/or breaststroke) and alternated styles
(AS – front crawl and/or backstroke).
2. Methods
2.1. Experimental design and subjects
The present study used a crossectional design com-
paring muscle isokinetic evaluation data of two groups
of short distance young swimmers (50 m, 100 m and200 m events). Nineteen international or national eliteswimmers were recruited in national competitions, andwere divided into two groups on the basis of their swim-ming style specialization: SS (butter ﬂy(n=4) or
breaststroke ( n=3) swimming styles) and AS (front
crawl ( n=9) or backstroke ( n=3) swimming styles).

All volunteers were healthy and right leg dominant, did
not have any injury for the last six month, and were in
the pre-competition stage of their training. Although
volunteers also used swimming styles different than
their specialty during some phases of training session,most of the speci ﬁc training regimen consisted of their
swimming specialty. Resistance exercise was included
in the training regimen of all volunteers (for at least
three years), and similar programs were performed by
SS and AS groups during the season (including type,
volume and intensity of exercises). Subjects’ charac-
teristics and current training status are displayed in Ta-ble 1. There were no signi ﬁcant differences between the
groups for these variables. The SS and AS groups per-
formed muscle isokinetic evaluation at least two days
after last competition or intensive training session, and
were adequately familiarized with testing procedures.The research was approved by the ethics committee at
our institution, and all subjects gave written informed
consent after a thorough explanation of the study design
and protocol.
2.2. Isokinetic evaluation
Knee extension- ﬂexion (concentric-concentric) isok-
inetic evaluation was performed using a Biodex Multi-
Joint System 3 dynamometer (Biodex Medical
TM,
Shirley, NY , USA). After a standardized warm-up, sub-
jects were positioned according to the manufacturer’s
manual (seated with arms hanging against the body,
hands holding the lateral handles while strapped for
stabilizing the trunk and thigh). Gravitational correc-tion was performed at 40
◦of knee ﬂexion. Isokinet-
ic testing at 60 and 300◦/s were used for data collec-
tion. Subjects performed three submaximal repetitions
at each angular speed prior to data collection. Five and
thirty maximal repetitions were performed at 60 and
300◦/sec, respectively. A 60-s rest period was used
between velocities. Consistent verbal commands weregiven during the tests. All tests were conducted by
the same experienced exam iner and were performed
bilaterally.
Peak torque (PT) and PT-based HQ ratio (heretofore
the ratio) were the variables assessed at 60
◦/s. The
peak value of knee extension and ﬂexion across the
ﬁve repetitions was considered the outcome measure.
Total work and work fatigue index were the variables
assessed at 300◦/s. Total work correspond to the work
performed throughout the thirty repetitions measured inJoules. Work fatigue index was calculated as 1 – (mean
peak torque from 1
st10 repetitions – mean peak torque
from the last 10 repetitions) / (mean peak torque from
1st10 repetitions), and was reported as percentage.2.3. Statistical analyses
All data are reported as means ±standard devia-
tion. The SPSS 12.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc, Chica-
go, IL, USA) was used for the statistical analysis.The Kolmogorov–Smirnov test was applied to ensure
a Gaussian distribution of the data. Unpaired Student
ttest was used to analyze differences in the subjects’
characteristics and current tr aining status. Inter- and
intra-group (right vs.left leg) comparisons of the isoki-
netic variables were performed using a two-way ANO-
V A. Bonferroni post hoc analysis was used to deter-
mine signi ﬁcance of data that was indicated by two-
way ANOV A. The signi ﬁcance level was set at P<
0.05.
3. Results
Means and standard deviations of peak torque
for concentric knee extension and ﬂexion and ago-
nist/antagonist ratio at angular velocity of 60
◦/s, and
total work and work fatigue index at angular velocity
of 300◦/s, for both right and left legs of both SS and AS
group are presented in Table 2. The two-way ANOV A
did not indicate signi ﬁcant differences between groups
or between legs for the PTs, total work and work fa-
tigue index. However, the ratio was lower in AS than
SS group for both right and left legs (P =0.034).
4. Discussion
The main result of the present study was that SS
group displayed a greater knee HQ ratio than AS group,
although no signi ﬁcant difference was observed in the
other variables. To the best of our knowledge, this is theﬁrst study to compare isokinetic muscle performance
between competitive elite swimmers of different styles.
Swimming (short distance events) is a power-limited
sport [2,9], and the power generation during sprint
swimming is dependent on the maximal force produc-tion and velocity potential of muscles’ contractile el-
ements [10]. However, the ability to maintain a high
percent of peak power associated with a good tech-nique and mechanical ef ﬁciency may be a more valu-
able attribute [10]. Besides upper limb and trunk mus-
cle performance, lower lim b muscular performance is
also critical for reaching and maintaining fast swim-
ming speeds but this has rarely been studied amongswimmers. Speci ﬁcally, knee extension and/or ﬂex-

ion PT has served as the primary outcome measure for
comparing swimmers of different ages [1], swimmersof different distance events [8], and swimmers and soc-cer players [7], but not between swimmers of differentswimming styles.
Knee extension PT at angular velocities varying from
48 to 240
◦/s was compared among thirty elite long
(400 m and longer events), middle (200 m and 400 mevents) and short (events shorter than 200 m) distanceswimmers. Signi ﬁcantly lower PT values were found in
long compared to short distance swimmers, while mid-dle distance swimmers displayed intermediated val-ues [8]. However, the previous study did not analyzethe HQ ratio, and did not compare knee extension PTamong swimmers of different styles. When knee ex-tension and ﬂexion PT at 60, 120 and 180
◦/s were com-
pared among swimmers, soccer players and physically
active controls, lower PTs were found in controls inall velocities, but not between swimmers and soccerplayers [7].
In the present study, no signi ﬁcant difference in the
PTs (60
◦/s), total work (300◦/s) and work fatigue index
(300◦/s) were found between SS and AS group. How-
ever, SS group displayed greater levels of HQ ratio thanAS group. Differences in the biomechanics of swim-
ming may account, at least in part, for the observed dif-ference in this ratio. In the symmetric swimming style,knee extension and ﬂexion are performed simultane-
ously. In the butter ﬂy, quadriceps and hamstring per-
formance are important for forward propulsion by kneeand hip extension and ﬂexion during trunk undulation,
and in the breaststroke the quadriceps and hamstringactivity are mainly required at the end of the kick afterhip adduction and internal rotation [9]. On the otherhand, a fast and powerful knee extension and ﬂexion,
performed alternately between the legs, is importantfor forward propulsion in the freestyle and backstrokestyles.
One can argue that the reduced ratio in AS group
may be a result of other training variables not relat-
ed to swimming style, as for example the practice of
resistance exercise or different training levels duringthe isokinetic evaluation. However, all athletes were insimilar training stage when isokinetic evaluation wasperformed, and performed similar protocols of resis-tance training as part of their physical conditioningtraining. Moreover, the resistance exercise was includ-ed in their training regim en for at least three years,
264 L.L.B. Secchi et al. / Isokinetic evaluation in elite swimmers
and similar programs were performed by SS and AS
groups during the seasoning type, volume and intensityof exercises.
Although the highest rate of sports related injury
in elite swimmers occur in the shoulder, knee injuriesare frequently found in this population [11,12]. Knee
pain ranks second to shoulder pain as a common com-
plaint in competitive swimmers, and may accompanyall strokes [13]. Although several factors may predis-
pose to knee pain and injury in elite swimmers, imbal-
ance between hamstring and quadriceps strength (PT-based agonist/antagonist ratio) may have important im-
plications [13–16].
The HQ ratio of healthy knees has generally been
varied from 55% to 77% at 60
◦/s, with lower levels as-
sociated with greater prevalence of injury [17]. In this
context, the low ratio, observed mainly in AS group,
suggests that swimmers may need a resistance exercise
training program designed to improve strength balancebetween hamstrings and quadriceps muscle, although
the relationship between this ratio and knee injury in
swimmers, as well as the comparison of knee injuryprevalence between SS and AS swimmers, needs fur-
ther investigation.
It is also important to note that although the ratio was
higher in SS than AS group, both groups displayed low
levels of this variable when compared to both nonath-
letes and athletes of other sports [17,18]. Because theselow HQ scores are probably a function of swimming
biomechanics, one may ask whether an improved bal-
ance may be negative for sports-speci ﬁc performance,
although it may be positive for injury prevention. Fu-
ture studies addressed to this issue are needed to answer
this question.
In summary, butter ﬂy and breaststroke short distance
elite swimmers displayed greater knee muscles HQ ra-
tio than front crawl and backstroke short distance eliteswimmers. No signi ﬁcant differences between groups
were observed in the other isokinetic variables ana-
lyzed. These results suggest the need of designing a re-
sistance exercise training program to improve strength
balance between hamstrings and quadriceps muscles offront crawl and backstroke short distance elite swim-
mers.
