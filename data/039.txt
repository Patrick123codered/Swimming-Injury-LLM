Background : This review details the examination, diagnosis, treatment and
management of injuries encountered by competitive swimmers. Primarily, theseinvolve the shoulder, however, the spine, knee and hip can be involved. Using
the Coleman methodology score, we show that the methods used in obtaining
and reporting clinical ﬁndings and intervention results could be improved.Where possible, we suggest improvements.
Sources of data : A literature review was conducted in English, Italian, French
and German using PubMed, Google Scholar and Ovid search engines with strictinclusion/exclusion criteria.
Areas of agreement : Poor technique, and high training intensity and distance
are the most common cause of missed swim practice and competition throughinjury.
Areas of controversy : Few articles agree on a single method of each of clinical
examination, diagnosis, treatment and rehabilitation.
Growing points : Articles are consistently retrospective with few investigating
spine, hip and knee injuries.
Areas timely for developing research : Clinical ﬁndings and rehabilitation
methods should be reported using a more structured method possibly based onthe Coleman methodological scoring system.

Introduction
Swimming is a popular sport among all generations. Participants range
from those who swim only occasionally for recreational purposes to
those who swim regularly for fitness and to those who compete at
national and international levels. The buoyant effect of water lendsitself to a reduced risk of injury among those who partake at a rec-reational level.
1However, numerous articles describe injuries among
competitive and elite swimmers.
Swimming injuries primarily arise from repetitive strain and micro-
trauma. This is not surprising when one considers the exposure of
high-level swimmers to the repetitive motions that make up the four
competitive swimming strokes. Activity exposure in terms of distancecovered may range from 9 km/week at club level to 110 km/week at
international level for much of the swimming season.
2Therefore, the
amount of overhead activity these athletes partake in is vast.
Diagnosis of swimming injuries is mostly clinical, but other methods
such as imaging, and in some cases, invasive procedures have been used;
however, there is no common method by which examination and diag-nosis of injured swimmers is made. The most common site of injury isthe shoulder. Hence, the majority of scientific literature describing inju-
ries in swimmers concentrates on ‘swimmer’s shoulder’; and the many
structural pathologies associated with it, supraspinatus tendinopathybeing the most common.
2–6Other sites of injury include the hip adduc-
tors, medial collateral ligaments of the knee and lumbar disc of the
spine with degenerative disease.7–14The literature describing these
other injuries is sparse. Across the literature, there is no agreed method
of rehabilitating injured swimmers, although resting and a reduced
work load is commonly used in different fashions.
There has been no previous attempt to produce a systematic review of
the literature regarding the epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment and reha-
bilitation of injuries related to competitive-level swimmers. This papertherefore reviews methods by which swimmers are examined and diag-nosed, and whether these are methodologically sound. It also illustrates
different methods for treatment and rehabilitation of common swim-
ming injuries, and, where possible, suggests ways to improve these.
Methods
Literature search
We performed a literature search using the keywords ‘swimmer’,
‘swimmers’ and ‘swimming’ in addition to ‘pain’ and in combinationT. Gaunt and N. Maffulli

with either ‘shoulder’, ‘back’, ‘lumbar’, ‘knee’ or ‘hip’. No limit for the
age of publication was set. The search was performed in the search
engines PubMed (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez); GoogleScholar (http://scholar.google.com); and Ovid (http://www.ovid.com).
This search returned 47 articles regarding the shoulder, 9 on the spine,
8 for the knee and 2 for the hip. The websites were last accessed inDecember 2010.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Each abstract from an article published in a peer-reviewed journal was
considered. Given the language skills of the research team, articles in
English, French, Spanish, Portuguese and Italian were considered. If the
abstract was unavailable, the article was excluded. Single-case studies,review articles and letters were excluded, and all prospective and retro-
spective cohort studies were included. The full text was accessed for
these articles and, where the full text was not available electronically,the author was contacted and the article requested. Those articles that
were unattainable after requesting them from the authors were
excluded (Fig. 1). All the articles thus selected were then studied to
assess similarities in injury incidence, clinical findings, imaging, riskfactors and rehabilitation methods and outcomes.
Quality assessment and statistical analysis
The Coleman methodology score criteria15were used to assess the
methods of each article. A maximum score of 100 across 10 criteriawould show that the study design was free from the influence of
chance, confounding factors and biases. A score lower than 50 showed
poor quality, a score between 50 and 69 moderate quality, a scorebetween 70 and 84 good quality and a score above 85 excellent quality
(Table 1). All articles were assessed by the main author twice. The
mean CMS and standard deviation were calculated for each CMS ofthe shoulder, spine, hip and knee.
Results
Studies
Thirteen articles on the shoulder were included. Of these, four were
prospective and nine retrospective studies. Three articles regarding the
spine were included, one being prospective and two being retrospective.All three of the articles included for the knee were retrospective studies.
Finally, one retrospective study was included for the hip. All articles
were published in the time frame between 1985 and 2010.
Quality assessment
The Coleman methodology score allows quality assessment of methods
and reported outcomes based on a validated set of criteria.15TheseSoothing suffering swimmers: a systematic review

reproducibility of 99%.17This method of assessment has been used by
several authors in recent systematic reviews.18–20No systematic review
has been previously carried out on swimming injuries. In comparison
with narrative reviews of clinical assessment, risk factors and suggestedmethods of rehabilitation of swimming injuries, this systematic review
appraises methodology and reported outcomes with respect to clinical
assessment, risk factors and rehabilitation.

Hip
Table 9shows the demographics of patients with hip pain.
Clinical assessment and questionnaire/survey
Shoulder
Three articles reported clinical findings.2,4,13Each article examined a
range of different tissues within the shoulder using different techniques
(Table 10). Table 11shows a comparison of the tissue structures exam-
ined across the three articles. The only test that was used in all articleswhen examining the shoulder was the apprehension sign for anterior
joint instability. The infraspinatus and teres minor were examined in
two studies,
2,4as was subacromial impingement.3,4Lesions of the
acromio-clavicular joint, superior labral anterior to posterior (SLAP)lesions and lesions of the long head of the biceps tendon were exam-
ined in one study only,
2as was rotator cuff stability.4Supraspinatus
and subscapularis were not the focus of any of the studies identified.The only test that is common across the three papers reporting clinical
features in the shoulder is the apprehension sign.
2,4,13Therefore,
although the shoulder is examined thoroughly, making an exact com-parison between the examinations of swimmers’ shoulders in their
subject populations is not as simple as it might seem. It might thereforeTable 5 Coleman15score: hip.

might make comparison of clinical findings simpler.
Spine
One study undertook a clinical examination of the subjects7including
palpation of the lower back, neurological examination of lower extre-
mities, and lumbar spine flexibility testing in 47 swimmers and 71 non-athletic controls. The methods of the examination were not included.
Two studies
7,8asked subjects to complete a questionnaire regarding
back pain. In one study,7each subject was asked whether they had
experienced lower back pain and whether this was very mild, mild,
moderate or severe. They were also asked whether pain radiated to theTable 9 Hip adductor pain in swimmers in Grote et al.13(absolute ﬁgures and percentages

leg at the time of worst ever lower back pain, and, finally, whether
they had experienced any lower back pain in the last 4 weeks, and
again whether it radiated to their legs. The second study8compared
lower back pain in 56 elite swimmers and 38 recreational level swim-mers. Each subject filled out a questionnaire asking whether they had
experienced low back pain, whether the back pain was ‘severe’, and
whether it interfered with their daily lives. Although both studiescrudely surveyed the severity of back pain, only one inquired aboutneurological signs.
8
Hangai et al.7showed that at logistic regression a greater proportion
of swimmers experienced lower back pain than non-athletes. Kaneokaet al.
8showed that of 56 swimmers, 43 had experienced back pain of
whom 29 reported it as severe; 33 of 38 recreational swimmers
reported that they had experienced back pain and 14 rated it as severe.
Hip
The one article13regarding hip pain in swimmers did not report any
clinical findings. Swimmers answered a questionnaire regarding how
many episodes of hip adductor pain or subjective weakness they hadexperienced in the past swimming season, how long each period lasted
for and at what period during the season the injury occurred.
Tables 12and 13show the findings. Thirty-three of the breaststroke
swimmers participating in the survey were unable to partake in swim-
ming practice at least once during the season due to hip adductor
injury.

Vizsolyi et al .12examined 16 swimmers for knee pain in the areas
shown in Table 15. Both studies examined similar, but not exactly the
same, structures. In addition, only Rovere and Nichols10noted whether
the pain in the knee was bilateral or unilateral, and at the dominant or
non-dominant side (Table 16). Vizsolyi et al.12surveyed 209 swimmers
regarding the site of their pain (Table 17). Rovere and Nichols10
showed that swimmers who experienced knee pain frequently were
older, had swum competitively for longer, swam more breaststroke per
week and stretched more than those experiencing pain occasionallyand never/rarely (Tables 14and 15). However, these swimmers had
trained less frequently during the season than those with less knee
pain. Swimmers with knee pain also had a less breaststroke-specificwarm-up, emphasizing the importance of a good warm-up in prep-aration for each stroke. Also, swimmers who had progressed to a
higher level suffered less knee pain, possibly explained by the fact that
a lack of pain allows a more intense training programme, or that differ-ent techniques between high and lower level swimmers allow a faster,
more efficient stroke that does not predispose to developing knee pain
on breaststroke kick. Vizsolyi et al .

recorded the location of pain. Patellar involvement was mainly at the
inferomedial border, and was reported as the most tender area in these
subjects. Of the athletes with medial collateral ligament injuries, onlythree who had unilateral pain had isolated medial collateral ligament
abnormalities. Lateral collateral ligament pain in isolation was rare,
but, when present, was always associated with medial collateral liga-ment or patellar abnormalities (Tables 15and17).
Tables 14–17provide information regarding pain location, in which
subjects, and whether it was unilateral or bilateral. However, the
various studies do not provide the same data summary, comparisonsare hard to make and hence conclusions difficult to draw. Vizsolyi
et al.
12agree with Rovere and Nichols10in that the most common site
for knee pain is in the medial aspect of the dominant knee, mostspecifically the medial collateral ligament of the right leg.Table 14 Details of location of knee pain in Rovere and Nichols10(absolute ﬁgures and

Imaging
Shoulder
Two studies reported magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) changes
within the rotator cuff and surrounding tissues.2,5Seinet al.2reported
changes in a more detailed structure-specific manner (Table 18) after
imaging 52 swimmers. Fredericson et al.5recruited six female swim-
mers with no history of or current shoulder pain. Each swimmer wasexamined by a physician and found to be asymptomatic. A fat-
suppressed T2 MRI of the right shoulder for five swimmers and of the
left shoulder for one swimmer was then performed. The authors thengraded the findings of five structures, namely rotator cuff, labrum,
bone, ligament and tendon/muscle. There were four grades of structural
change: 0 ¼normal, 1 ¼mild, 2 ¼moderate and 3 ¼severe. Each
shoulder was investigated for minimum thickness of the supraspinatustendon, acromion shape, tendinopathy, tears and arthritis of the
acromio-clavicular joint. Supraspinatus tendinopathy was graded by
Sein et al .
2using a four-point scale similar to that of Fredericson.5
Grade 0 was awarded for complete homogeneity and was classified as
normal. Grade 1 (mild tendinopathy) was awarded if there was a mild
focal increase in tendon signal intensity that was not equal to fluid.Grade 2 (moderate tendinopathy) was awarded if there was a moderate
focal increase in tendon signal intensity not equal to fluid, and Grade 4
(severe tendinopathy) was awarded if there was a marked generalizedincrease in tendon signal. All images were reviewed by a single well-
trained observer. Table 19shows the MRI findings.
5None of the
swimmers had either normal tendon or severe degenerative changes.All images were reviewed by a musculoskeletal radiologist. Sein et al.

reported changes specific to tissues within the shoulder in 52 swim-
mers, and the results obtained using fat-suppressed T2 MRI are given
in Table 18. Both studies report MRI changes within the rotator cuff
and surrounding tissues. However, Sein et al .2report changes in a
more detailed structure-specific manner.Table 17 Vizsolyi et al.:12location of knee pain (absolute ﬁgures and percentages are

Spine
Three studies used MRI to assess lumbar disc degeneration in swim-
mers with back pain.7–9Table 20shows the Pfirrmann23classification
used by two studies to assess degeneration.7,8Another study9per-
formed MRI on the lumbar spine of 8 elite-level and 11 national-levelswimmers. None had back pain at the time of the study. A positive
MRI change was defined as degenerative or other disc changes and
spondylolisthesis or spondylolysis. It is difficult to compare degener-ation across all three articles without using the same classification.
Hangai et al.
7classified subjects as having lumbar disc degeneration if
their scan showed Pfirrmann23Grade III or greater changes or if disc
degeneration was found at more than one level. Table 21shows the
number of swimmers and controls who had disc degeneration findings
on MRI. Kaneoka et al.8showed that a greater number of elite swim-
mers had disc degeneration than recreational swimmers ( P¼,0.05).7Table 18 Sein2MRI changes ( n¼52).

On the other hand, Kaneoka et al.8found that subjects also showed
greater evidence of disc degeneration, but this difference was not sig-
nificant. Both studies show that, in those with disc degeneration, theL5/S1 disc is most commonly affected. Also, males suffered more discdegeneration than females, and disc degeneration was found more in
those reporting both low back pain.
8However, these differences were
not great enough to reach significance.Table 20 Pﬁrrmann23classiﬁcation of spinal disc degeneration.

Goldstein et al.9found in eight AA/AAA elite-level swimmers only
one abnormal disc and no cases of spondylolysis. Of the 11 national
standard swimmers, 2 cases of abnormal disc were found and again nocases of spondylolysis. Goldstein et al.
9also studied the same changes
in gymnasts, finding that spondylolysis and disc abnormalities were
more frequent. However, no significant comparison could be made, asswimmers trained less than gymnasts and did not reach the threshold
to allow for comparison. One of the swimmers had spine abnormal-
ities. No indication of whether these subjects suffered from back painis given.

Risk factors
Joint laxity
Shoulder
Seven studies2,3,21,22,24,25,26compared joint laxity in swimmers
(Table 22). Two studies2,26did not compare joint laxity between swim-
mers and any control group. One study24compared joint laxity
between Division 1 national swimmers and club swimmers as controls.All other studies
3,21,22,24,25compared joint laxity between swimmers
and non-swimming controls. Only five studies2,3,22,24,26reported
whether either subjects or controls experienced shoulder pain. Bothswimmers and controls in all other studies had no shoulder pain. The
method of examination was purely clinical in two studies.
22,26Drawer
test and sulcus sign were used in one study,26and simply the obser-
vation whether the shoulder was stable anteriorly or posteriorly in the
other.22Both clinical and instrumental analysis occurred in one
study.21Clinically, the sulcus sign and drawer test were used as
described above, in addition to the Beighton hypermobility criteria(Table 23). Instrumentally, the Myrin OB Goniometer was used. Purely
instrumental analysis occurred in four studies, with one study
3using
the Kin-Com H-2 isokinetic dynamometer, two studies using theUniversal goniometer
24,25and one study using an instrumented lax-
ometer.2Shoulder laxity has been postulated as a risk factor for the
development of shoulder pain in swimmers. McMaster et al .26

head) was measured in centimetres and manual provocation test results
for anterior displacement were given a score depending on the relative
displacement of the humeral head from the glenoid. No displacementwas given a score of 1, humeral head shift a score of 2, joint edge
perch a score of 4 and frank dislocation a score of 8. If an apprehen-
sion sign was detected, four points were added to the subjects’ score.Athletes with shoulder pain at the time of examination scored a higher
examination score than those with no pain at the time, thus suggesting
that swimmers had a greater degree of joint laxity [confidence interval(CI)¼95%].
Jansson et al .
21measured joint laxity in children of two age
groups against age- and gender-matched controls (Table 6). General
joint laxity was measured according to the score used by Beightonet al .
27(Table 23). Typically, young adults range between 4 and 6
out of 9, with a score of 6 or greater indicating hypermobility. In
both age groups, male swimmers demonstrated a greater degree ofgeneral joint laxity than their reference groups. Female swimmers
demonstrated a lower degree of general joint laxity compared with
their controls at the age of 9 years, and no significant difference atthe age of 12. Anterior glenohumeral laxity was measured using the
anterior drawer test. The findings were subjectively awarded a
Grade 1 if there was normal translation, Grade 2 if excessive trans-lation within the glenoid was evident, Grade 3 if the humeral head
translated over the glenoid rim and Grade 4 if there was frank dislo-
cation over the glenoid rim. McMaster et al .
26and Jansson et al .21
have used a very similar grading of anterior glenohumeral laxity.
Inferior glenohumeral laxity was subjectively graded in a similar
fashion to that of McMaster et al.26The arm was pulled inferiorly,
and the distance between the acromion and humeral head measured.Grade 1 was awarded if the distance was ,1 cm, Grade 2 if 1–
2c m a n d G r a d e 3 i f .2c m .
28,29No significant differences were
found between swimmers and control subjects concerning anterioror inferior laxity. The range of rotation was recorded using a Myrin
OB Goniometer. This device measured internal and external rotation
with the patient supine, elbow flexion to 90 8and shoulder abduc-
tion to 90 8. Internal and external rotation were then measured until
movement of the trunk was observed. Internal rotation was signifi-
cantly less in both male and female swimmers aged 9 and 12 years
when compared with controls. No significant difference in externalrotation was found between swimmers and controls. However, a sig-
nificantly smaller difference was found in the total range of move-
ment for swimmers aged both 9 and 12 years compared with theirreference population. These findings are not useful to define
whether laxity is associated with shoulder pain, as there were noT. Gaunt and N. Maffulli

inclusion or exclusion criteria governing participation with respect
to shoulder injury or pain. However, they can be used to showrelationships between swimming and the degree of laxity in swim-
mers and controls, and contribute towards a conclusion in conjunc-
tion with other studies detailing the relationship between pain andlaxity (Table 22).
Borsa et al .
22studied 42 national collegiate athletic association
Division 1 swimmers (asymptomatic at the time of testing) and 44age-matched controls using a sonographic method. Of the 27 (64%)
swimmers reported a history of unilateral or bilateral shoulder
pain. Seveenteen of these subjects reported pain from rotator cufftendinopathy, 5 from biceps tendinopathy, 3 from non-specificsources, 1 from thoracic outlet syndrome and 1 from a labral tear.
Subjects were placed sitting in the upright position within a ‘Telos’
framework, allowing shoulders to be positioned and stabilized at908of abduction and 60 8of external rotation. A stress device was
used to apply a force of 15 dN to the proximal humerus in an
anterior and posterior direction. An ultrasound scanner was thenused to measure the excursion distance of the humeral head from
identified bony landmarks of the scapula. Images were taken at both
the baseline and at the force level of 15 dN. Displacement wasrecorded as the difference in distance between the baseline and forceTable 23 Beighton27hypermobility grading.

Cinematographic analysis
Shoulder
Three studies performed electromyogenic cinematographic analysis
of 12 muscles used in front crawl,30breaststroke31and butterfly.31
The difference in activity of each of these muscles during the pull-
through and recovery phases of each stroke was noted as being
either more or less than during the same phases of the stroke in
swimmers with no shoulder pain. Scovazzo et al .30noted that
muscle recruitment and use were different between swimmers withpain in the shoulder and those without (Table 24). At the very
beginning of the front-crawl stroke (the ‘catch’), swimmers with
shoulder pain showed less activity in the rhomboids, upper trapeziusand anterior and middle deltoids than those without shoulder pain.
There was also less activity in the serratus anterior, but more
activity in rhomboids in swimmers with pain during the active pullphase of the stroke. On hand exit and the beginning of the recovery
phase, anterior and middle deltoids were less active in swimmers
with pain, whereas the infraspinatus was more active in those withpain. Finally, during the mid-recovery phase, the subscapularis wasless active among those experiencing pain. No difference in the
firing pattern or the amplitude of posterior deltoid, supraspinatus,
teres minor, pectoralis major or latissimus dorsi was found betweenswimmers with shoulder pain and those with normal shoulders.
Subscapularis muscle activity and teres minor activity decreased
during the pull-through phase of the breaststroke

Rehabilitation
Shoulder
Brushøj et al.33compiled a retrospective analysis of 18 swimmers who had
undergone arthroscopic surgery between 1999 and 2000. The most
common finding was labral pathology, shown in 11 subjects (69%) atarthroscopy. Of these subjects, five showed posterior superior impinge-
ment, two in combination with subacromial impingement. Six of the 11
subjects showing labral pathology showed labral tears, two of these hadSLAP lesions and one a Bankart lesion. The second most common pathol-ogy was subacromial impingement, found in five swimmers, two of whom
had posterior superior impingement as well. Two swimmers had isolated
long head biceps tendon tendinopathy and one swimmer had diffuse syno-vitis. One swimmer showed no pathological findings. The most common
procedure carried out was debrideme nt, received by 11 swimmers. Partial
release of the coraco-acromial ligam ent was carried out in four swimmers
and bursectomy in four swimmers. With respect to return to sport, nine
swimmers returned to their pre-injury level, seven returned to sport with
no pain and two returned with some shoulder pain.

Discussion
Quality assessment
Shoulder
Study populations were generally small, with only two studies2,21
scoring maximum points. All studies were retrospective cohort studies.
All studies scored maximum points for the number of proceduresincluded in each reported outcome. Methods of assessment were
reported well, but the reporting of outcome criteria was performed
badly (Table 25).
Spine
All studies were retrospective cohort studies. No study scored
maximum points for the size of population. However, all studies usedmethods reporting good sensitivity and well-defined outcome criteria.
Outcomes were also reported well (Table 26).
Hip
This single retrospective cohort study reported well on outcome assess-
ment and recruitment of subjects.
Knee
Both studies were retrospective cohort studies with small populationsizes. Methods were reported badly, as were outcomes (Table 27).

Clinical findings
Shoulder
There is no straightforward way of interpreting whether findings from
the subjects examined are common across these three studies, as the
anterior joint capsule was the only structure examined in all threearticles. Bak and Faunø
4describe their study population as simply
having shoulder pain, whereas others describe clinical findings.
Shoulder pain is a broad term, and the phrase ‘shoulder pain’ or‘shoulder injury’ was encountered frequently during the review of the
literature, making it difficult to collate information to produce a homo-
geneous picture. While assessment of shoulder pain and shoulderinjury cannot be constrained within too rigid, a framework based on

individual subject reports, every attempt should be made to report find-
ings in a more uniform way.
Spine
The method of assessment of lower back pain used by both Hangai
et al.7and Kaneoka et al.8is subjective, and may not be a reliable tool
when comparing individuals. A more sensitive tool for measuring back
pain such as the Oswestry34disability index should be used in the
future.
Hip
Grote et al .13postulate that hip adductor injury is correlated with
increased breaststroke distance covered in training. There are no other
studies to which this can be compared.
Knee
Although there are similarities in reports from both studies, exact com-
parison cannot be drawn. A more structured framework that allowsdescription of knee pain may be helpful. This may be achieved in terms
of whether the pain is unilateral or bilateral; if unilateral, whether the
pain is felt in the left or right leg, the site and structure affected (i.e.medial collateral ligament), and whether the subject is left- or right-
side dominant. This can easily be adapted to compare males and for
gender-specific epidemiological studies and is outlined in Table 28.
Subjects with knee pain had significantly reduced internal rotation of
the hip. This motion is essential in the biomechanics of breaststroke
swimming, and poor hip flexibility could predispose to poor kick tech-nique, and hence increased stress placed on the medial aspect of the
knee during the thrust phase of the breaststroke kick. By correcting
internal rotation and flexibility in these swimmers, knee pain may beavoided.

Imaging
Shoulder
A more uniform method for reporting MRI findings might allow com-
parison between subjects from different populations making it simpler
to draw conclusions. Sein et al.2use a more structured method, which
should be employed in future work.

the context of subjects with changes reporting back pain, it becomes a
powerful method to show causes of back pain in swimmers.
Risk factors
Joint laxity
Shoulder
Table 22shows possible relationships between shoulder laxity, com-
petitive swimming and shoulder pain, and includes details from other
studies regarding shoulder laxity. Accurate, objective, non-invasive and
reproducible measurements of shoulder laxity are difficult to make inthe clinical setting.
35As Table 22shows, there are many different
methods of measuring joint laxity, each study using a different method.
Two studies found greater shoulder laxity in swimmers than in con-
trols. Jansson et al.21reported significantly greater shoulder laxity in
male swimmers aged 9 and 12, and female swimmers aged 9 when
compared with controls. Female swimmers aged 12 had less shoulderlaxity than controls. Correlation with shoulder pain was not includedas part of this study. Rupp et al.
3found that swimmers had a greater
degree of laxity than their controls. However, they found that,
although shoulder pain was reported among subjects, there was no sig-nificant association with shoulder laxity. McMaster et al.
26reported
that swimmers with pain had a greater degree of laxity than swimmers
without pain. However, no comparison against a control group wasmade. Both Borsa et al .
22and Beach et al .24found no significant
association between shoulder pain and laxity.Table 28 Suggested method of assessing knee pain in swimmers.

Only McMaster et al .26and Sein2found significant correlations
between joint laxity and shoulder pain. However, subjects in the
study by McMaster et al . reported pain as ‘shoulder pain’ whereas
Sein2reported not only the presence of pain but its location, and
whether ‘extreme pain’ was experienced in subjects with proven
supraspinatus tendinopathy. At what point this extreme pain wasexperienced, however, was unclear. There was also no comparison
against controls.
To draw more useful conclusions regarding associations between
competitive swimming, shoulder laxity and shoulder pain, an attempt
at a more standardized reporting method should be made such as that
used by Jansson et al .
21This should detail examination findings, a
standard tool for assessment of displacement and flexibility (one of thedevices mentioned in Table 22under method of assessment), and
whether pain was significantly associated with any difference in laxity
in the shoulders of swimmers when compared with age- and sex-matched controls.
Cinematographic analysis
Shoulder
Over- or under-activity in each muscle mentioned may lead to a
misaligned stroke, and consequently act as a risk factor for develop-
ing pain. For example, decreased supraspinatus activity disables the
force produced by the supraspinatus and the deltoid in elevation ofthe humerus during the mid-late recovery in breaststroke, encoura-ging impingement.
31Swimmers with painful shoulders during front
crawl showed a pattern of hand entry that differed from that of
their peers without pain, as the humerus entered the water at alower level with respect to their hand, i.e. ‘dropping their elbow’.
Swimmers who kept a high elbow during hand entry experienced
less pain. This was consistent with the finding that the anterior andmiddle deltoid of those with a painful shoulder was less active
during this phase of the stroke.
30
Therefore, with knowledge of the individual muscle function, tech-
nique coaching can be used to prevent injury from a technically poorstroke, and rehabilitation can be targeted towards strengthening indi-
vidual muscles or redressing the balance of muscles used during the
pull-through and recovery phases of the stroke.
30–32Swimming is evol-
ving, and stroke techniques constantly changing. This may only occur
first among the elite, and further work may be warranted to prevent
injury in those entering more high-level competition, and henceembarking on more intensive and stroke-specific training programmes
at a young age.Soothing suffering swimmers: a systematic review

Knee
Extremes of hip abduction were associated with knee injury,12and can
contribute therefore towards a swimmer’s knee pain.
Rehabilitation
Shoulder
Table 29shows methods of shoulder rehabilitation. Brushøj et al .33
make two conclusions. Firstly, arthroscopy in swimmers who have
been resistant to rehabilitation for shoulder pain showed mainly labral
pathology and subacromial impingement. Secondly, the return rate to alevel that matched that of their pre-injury state after debridement andbursectomy was 56%. Therefore, procedures aiming to stabilize labral
pathology in swimmers with treatment-resistant shoulder pain are of
benefit only to some of those wishing to return to their pre-injurysporting level.
Allegrucci et al.
36described four phases of rehabilitation in swim-
mers with secondary shoulder impingement. Phase I aims to establish afirm scapular base from which to strengthen the rotator cuff in a
neutral position. Phase II uses strengthening exercises in the 0–90 8
range, before moving to overhead exercises in Phase III, where func-tional training is introduced. Phase IV sees the swimmers return to a
full training programme, aiming to reach their pre-injury ability. They
also recommend that any strengthening programme should mirror theextreme repetition and muscular endurance required in swimming.There is much literature describing the distance that swimmers cover in
a training year (Table 6). As a direct result, swimmers perform an
incredible number of overhead arm rotations per year. Hence, it is notunreasonable
36to think that a traditional programme of, for example,
three sets of 10 repetitions of each exercise is inadequate. They there-
fore recommend that light weights and many repetitions be used inplace of this. This will allow non-prime movers, i.e. the rotator cuff, to
be better targeted, and therefore rehabilitated. However, sprinters and
long-distance swimmers require different rehabilitation programmes.Sprinters should perform a smaller number of repetitions with agreater weight to build and maintain explosive power. Long-distance
swimmers conversely should perform a greater number of repetitions.
36
Swimmers with painful shoulders have reduced proprioception (kinaes-
thetic) deficits with respect to their humeral and scapular position.37,38
Plyometric training has been proposed to improve this (Table 29).
Training modification and return to sport are also addressed, andswimmers’ yardage should be decreased during the season, by up to
50% during mid-season training. Other modifications include warmingT. Gaunt and N. Maffulli

up for a specified period of time, rather than distance, and increasing
rest intervals during and between training sessions.39Swimmers should
not increase distances covered in training by .10% per week.40This
allows adaptation of soft tissues to increased activity. Swimmers
should cease activity as soon as symptoms of impingement or returning
pain occur, so as not to exacerbate any damage.
Kenal et al.41have reported medical treatment methods for injuries
in competitive swimmers. They recommend that relative rest, ice and
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are of benefit in the acutesetting as a means of reducing inflammation and pain. They also rec-
ommend a 1 ml betamethasone (6 mg/ml) subacromial injection in
9 ml of 1% lidocaine to allow faster return to swimming practice.They also make recommendations for rehabilitation (Table 29), and
recommend that stroke mechanics be reviewed. In front crawl, a good
rolling stroke should be in place so as not to encourage impingement at
extreme internal rotation and adduction. Swimmers should also beencouraged to breathe bilaterally to prevent over-stressing the domi-
nant shoulder, and asymmetrical muscle strengthening and
development.
Bak
42thoroughly described prevention and treatment (Table 29).
With respect to prevention, swimmers and coaches should be well edu-
cated on topics such as early injury prevention and detection, togetherwith a multidisciplinary approach including sports therapists and, if
available, a team doctor.
43Training methods should concentrate on
promoting good balance within the stroke and strength training in theshoulder. Strength training should not be commenced in childhood, atleast until the growth plate has fused. Strength training in pre-
pubescent children is not recommended for several reasons. Firstly,
they lack sufficient circulating androgens to benefit from strength train-ing. Secondly, athletic children show no benefit when undertaking
strength training, nor does it reduce the risk of injury. Finally, it may
in fact cause injury in children.
44When strength training is introduced,
it is recommended that it should be in line with bone age.45Stretching
is advised in swimmers, provided that it is carried out in a non-ballistic
(bouncing) fashion, as this method activates the muscle spindles.Medical treatment for shoulder pain should take the form of NSAIDsas a first-line treatment when conservative measures have failed, fol-
lowed by intrabursal corticosteroid injection if pain is constant and
rehabilitation is hindered. Surgical treatment is only recommended as alast resort, and should be carried out between 3 and 6 months after
onset of pain if there is no improvement with conservative or medical
measures. Anterior acromioplasty has been used for mechanicalimpingement,
46,47with high success rates among patients over the age
of 40 years who did not partake in any athletic activity. DrawingT. Gaunt and N. Maffulli

conclusions regarding treatment for impingement in overhead athletes
from studies of populations who do not share common activities is
therefore not recommended. Swimmers can return to their pre-injurylevel after arthroscopic treatment,
33,35but this is not always the case.48
Subacromial decompression gives good pain relief, but with poor
return rates to competitive swimming.48There have been many reports
of arthroscopy and subacromial decompression in overhead athletes,
but few specifically involving swimmers. Poor results may be attributed
to the fact that the actual pathology in swimmers with painfulshoulders might be aggravated by arthroscopic surgical techniques.
47–
49Surgery may also be indicated in shoulders with instability, as with
complete capsule ruptures and Bankart lesions. The most commondirection in unstable shoulders is anterior and inferior. Bigliani et al.
50
found that 70% of swimmers returned to swimming at the same level
after an inferior capsular shift procedure. This procedure yields low
recurrence rates in shoulders with multidirectional instability.51
In summary, rehabilitation of swimmers’ shoulder ailments should
take the form of technique assessment, clinical assessment and correc-
tion of swimming technique, together with promotion of equilibriumbetween muscles involved in the swimming stroke. If rehabilitation is
not successful, medical treatment and surgical procedures are available,
albeit with mixed results, and prevention is better than cure. Educationand early detection of injuries, or contingencies against recurrence of
injury are essential in training competitive swimmers. The studies out-
lined in Table 29, although putting forward different techniques for
assessment and rehabilitation, all strive to reach a common goal, andagree largely on the fundamental principles best outlined by Bak
42with
conservative and medical treatment first, and finally surgery as a last
resort.
Spine
Kenal et al.41outline different causes of back pain arising in swimmers.
Lumbar myofascial strain can result from twisting motions involved in
flip-turning or when the body does not roll homogeneously during free-
style. Also, hyperextension of the spine (in technically poor butterflystroke, for example) may increase the likelihood of posterior facet irri-tation. If combined with lateral flexion, it may impinge on the lateral
facets also. Goldstein et al.
9showed that disc deformity and spondylo-
lysis can occasionally occur in swimmers, and Hangai et al .7and
Kaneoka et al .8demonstrated disc changes in swimmers with back
pain. Low back pain can also be associated with lumbar spine hyper-
mobility. This should be addressed in conjunction with increasing ham-string flexibility and strengthening of the trunk muscles, which are also
often weak in swimmers with back pain. Hamstrings tight enough toSoothing suffering swimmers: a systematic review

prevent a straight leg raise of above 80 8should be stretched. Flexible
quadriceps muscles should also be encouraged as well as hip flexors. If
these muscles are tight, they may increase the anterior pelvic tiltleading to an increased load placed on the vertebral facet joints. Bad
posture is also noted as a cause in competitive swimmers, who exhibit
genu recurvatum or a posterior pelvic tilt, causing the swimmer to relyon the spinous ligaments instead of muscles. This might be due to tight
hamstrings, and therefore provides another reason for maintaining
hamstring flexibility. However, it may also result from bad habit,
41
and should be discouraged by coaches. When the swimmer is actively
suffering from back pain, good posture should be encouraged and use
of a kick board should be reduced, as it accentuates lumbar lordosisand increases vertebral facet compression.
Hip
Swimmers reported that good flexibility52and stretching were useful in
overcoming groin stress in breaststroke.13However, according to
Shrier, stretching before activity may not be useful.53With all swim-
ming injuries, good technique coaching is key to prevention. A widebreaststroke kick is a risk factor for breaststroker’s knee,
14and might
also be a factor involved in developing hip adductor injury.13
Hip adductor injury can cause a sensation of weakness as well as
pain, which can also lead to missed practice sessions. This weakness or
even a ‘twinge’ may be an early indicator of adductor strain, or injury,
and should be taken seriously with a reduction in breaststroke traininguntil the problem has been addressed. Renstrom and Peterson
54have
suggested that adductor pain can be relieved by continuing activity, but
this can subsequently lead to further injury. This reinforces the point of
reducing breaststroke training during this time.
More research in this area should show which adductor muscle is
mostly involved or most at risk of injury in breaststroke swimming.13
Other research may involve a prospective study of breaststroke swim-
mers to identify training patterns and injury levels throughout a swim-
ming season, and what preventative measures may be put in place.
Knee
Forces occurring at the knee during the breaststroke kick includevalgus and rotation stresses during the propulsive phase in a technically
poor, wide kick.
41Other forces include external tibial rotation, circum-
duction and knee extension. Also, pushing off the wall after turning
was an aggravating factor.10Weak quadriceps or hip adductors may be
at fault in patellofemoral pain, as this leads to a functional genu valgusposition and subsequently increased patellofemoral compression forces
when pushing off the wall.

can be used to strengthen weak quadriceps. Hip abductors can be
strengthened by using stretch cords attached to a static object and
wrapped around the leg to be strengthened. The patient then abductsthe leg exercising the hip flexors bilaterally. Good flexibility in quadri-
ceps and hamstrings should be maintained as a preventative measure.

As with all overuse injuries, prevention should be a priority in all
training programmes. A good stroke-specific warm-up is essential.10
During periods of pain, breaststroke kick training should be reduced,10
and, in a similar fashion to shoulder pain, technique should be studiedand corrected, such as, for example, avoiding pushing off the wall in a
genu valgus position. Bad posture (such as genu recurvatum) should be
discouraged, and muscular imbalance should be noted and corrected.
Limitations
One limitation to this review is the lack of prospective studies, and the
small number of participants in the majority of studies reviewed. The
Coleman methodological score awards points based on the quality ofreporting methods and outcomes, and hence may not fairly represent
the scientific findings of those studies with low scores. Some articles
were excluded based on unavailability, and therefore their findings andmethods were not included in the systematic review. There was also
lack of input from potentially beneficial reports showing rates of injury
and rehabilitation methods in other overhead athletes, excluded on thebasis of our strict inclusion criteria.
Future work
Clinical assessment and examination findings of injuries in swimmersshould be recorded in a more structured way. We recommend a morestructured approach to methods and reporting findings in a more effi-
cient way, possibly based on the Coleman methodological scoring
system. This review has identified a number of areas that would benefitfrom greater evidence. Two of the three studies reporting spinalinjuries
7,8used the same method of classification for lumbar degener-
ation.23Neither, however, reported pain in the same subjective
manner. This area would benefit from more research using a commonclassification system, such as the Pfirrmann classification,
23for lumbar
degeneration and a common method for reporting lumbar pain in
swimmers, such as the Oswestry disability index.34We included only
one study on hip abductor injuries, and hence more research into the
epidemiology, diagnosis and management of hip injuries in swimmersSoothing suffering swimmers: a systematic review

as a whole is recommended. Joint laxity as a risk factor for injury
would benefit from further research. We included methods for asses-
sing joint laxity in the shoulder, and recommend that the Beightonhypermobility grading
27be applied to the spine, hip and knee, along
with clinical examination, and use of clinical tools such as the Myrin
OB Goniometer in assessing joint laxity as a risk factor for injury.Finally, all four strokes used in competitive swimming have evolved
since most articles regarding swimming injuries were published.
Therefore, new electromyographic cinematographic studies of the fourstrokes would be of benefit. This would show whether variations in
muscle pattern activity and recruitment during different phases of each
stroke still exist between injured and non-injured swimmers, andwhether they are still a risk factor for injury.
Conclusion
Research regarding swimming injuries is sub-optimal in terms of meth-odology and reporting clinical findings. Given the scarcity of recent pub-
lications regarding the treatment and rehabilitation of swimming
injuries, this field of sports medicine lacks the input from progress inrelated areas of sports medicine, such as that in other overhead athletes.
Most literature on swimming injuries is directed towards swimmers’
shoulders and impingement syndrome, and less on other injuries encoun-tered. Most studies identified were retrospective cohort studies. Although
prospective studies are more expensive and complicated, an effort should
be made to monitor progress in treatment and rehabilitation of injuredswimmers in this more methodologically sound way. Making compari-sons and conclusions from the current literature is difficult, as many
articles featured in this review report findings in different ways.
Treatment and rehabilitation of swimming injuries should be based
on a common methodology to assess success rates more effectively
among injured swimmers.
