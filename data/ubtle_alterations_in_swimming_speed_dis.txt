The  effects  of  engineered  nanomaterials  on  ﬁsh  behaviours  are  poorly  understood.  The  present  study
aimed  to  determine  the  locomotor  behaviours  of  trout  during  waterborne  exposure  to  titanium  dioxide
nanoparticles (TiO 2NPs)  as  well  as  inform  on  the  underlying  physiological  mechanisms  involved.  Trout
were exposed  to  either  control  (without  TiO 2),  1  mg  l−1TiO 2NPs  or  1  mg  l−1bulk  TiO 2for  14  days.  Titanium
dioxide exposure  resulted  in  31  (bulk)  and  22  fold  (nano)  increases  in  the  Ti  concentrations  of  gill  tissue
compared  to  controls,  but  there  were  no  measurable  increases  of  Ti  in  the  internal  organs  including  the
brain.  Gill  pathologies  were  observed  in  both  TiO 2treatments.  Locomotor  behaviours  were  quantiﬁed
using video  tracking  software  and  the  proportion  of  time  spent  swimming  at  high  speed  (>20  cm  s−1)  was
signiﬁcantly decreased  in  ﬁsh  exposed  to  TiO 2NPs,  compared  to  controls,  but  not  ﬁsh  exposed  to  bulk
TiO 2.  The  shift  in  swimming  speed  distribution  in  the  TiO 2NP-exposed  ﬁsh  was  associated  with  decreased
area  of  red  pulp  in  the  spleen,  increases  in  haematocrit  and  whole  blood  haemoglobin,  all  consistent  with
a compensation  for  respiratory  hypoxia  without  the  accumulation  of  plasma  lactate.  Fish  exposed  to
TiO 2NPs  also  retained  competitive  abilities  when  paired  with  controls  in  aggressive  social  encounters.
The duration  of  competitive  contests,  the  level  of  aggression  and  contest  outcome  were  not  affected  by
NP exposure.  Neurological  injury  did  not  explain  the  changes  in  locomotor  behaviour,  although  there
was  some  apparent  enlargement  of  the  blood  vessels  on  the  brain.  Whole  brain  homogenates  showed  a
statistically signiﬁcant  increase  in  oxidative  stress  defences  such  as  the  total  glutathione  pool,  but  without
loss of  Na+K+-ATPase  or  acetylcholinesterase  activities.

1.  Introduction
The ecotoxicity  of  engineered  nanomaterials  (ENMs)  has  been
the subject  of  intense  research  in  the  last  ﬁve  years  (reviews,
Moore,  2006;  Handy  et  al.,  2008;  Klaine  et  al.,  2008;  Kahru  and
Dubourguier, 2010;  Klaine  et  al.,  2012 ).  Concerns  have  been  raised
about the  effects  of  nano  metals  on  ﬁshes  (Shaw  and  Handy,  2011 ),
and also  on  the  sublethal  effects  of  ENMs  on  the  different  body  sys-
tems of  ﬁsh  (Handy  et  al.,  2011 ).  In  general,  sparingly  soluble  metal
or metal oxide ENMs are acutely toxic to ﬁshes at high mg l−1con-
centrations, with  sublethal  effects  on  body  systems  occurring  at
concentrations around  1  mg  l−1or  less  (Handy  et  al.,  2011 ).

E-mail  address:  r.handy@plymouth.ac.uk (R.D.  Handy).Sublethal
 effects  associated  with  exposure  to  TiO 2nanoparticles
(TiO 2NPs) in  the  laboratory  are  documented  for  some  body  systems
in ﬁshes.  These  include  damage  to  the  gill  epithelium  and  some  loss
of sinusoid  space  with  foci  of  lipidosis  in  the  liver  of  rainbow  trout
(Oncorhynchus
 mykiss )  during  14  day  exposures  to  1  mg  l−1TiO 2
NPs (Federici  et  al.,  2007 ).  Alterations  of  the  proportions  of  red  and
white pulp  in  the  spleen  have  also  been  observed  in  trout,  with  con-
cerns for  the  function  of  the  haematopoietic  system  (Handy  et  al.,
2011 ).  Renal  function  appears  to  be  largely  unaffected  by  injec-
tions of TiO 2NPs in  trout  (Scown  et  al.,  2009 ).  However,  the  effects
of
 ENMs  on  the  central  nervous  system  of  ﬁshes  are  poorly  under-
stood (see  discussion  in  Handy  et  al.,  2011 ).  The  brain  is  known  for
its lack  of  tolerance  to  hypoxia  and  sensitivity  to  oxidative  stress.  In
the brain  of  carp  (Cyprinus  carpio )  TiO 2NPs  caused  dose-dependent
increases
 in  thiobarbituric  acid  reactive  substances  (TBARS),  a
marker of  lipid  peroxidation  (Hao  et  al.,  2009 ).  Changes  in  TBARS
were also  reported  in  whole  brain  homogenates  from  rainbow  trout
exposed
 to  1  mg  l−1TiO 2NPs  (Federici  et  al.,  2007 ).  There  are  also
concerns for  the  electrical  properties  of  the  nervous  system,  with

inhibition of  Na+/K+-ATPase  in  trout  brain  following  chronic  dietary
exposure
 to  TiO 2NPs  (Ramsden  et  al.,  2009 ).  However,  electrophys-
iological studies  on  isolated  crab  nerve  preparations  indicate  the
ability of  peripheral  nerve  to  generate  action  potentials  may  not  be
affected (Windeatt  and  Handy,  2012 ).  Some  subtle  brain  patholo-
gies
 are  also  reported  in  ﬁsh  (Federici  et  al.,  2007 )  and  mammals
(Wang  et  al.,  2007 )  during  exposures  to  TiO 2NPs.  Together,  these
studies raise  the  possibility  that  the  brain  may  be  a  sensitive  target
for the  effects  of  TiO 2NPs  with  implications  for  neural  functions,
and consequently,  animal  behaviours.
The
 idea  that  contaminants  can  alter  the  behaviour  of  ﬁshes
is well  known,  and  effects  on  behaviour  can  occur  at  much  lower
exposure concentrations  than  expected  for  traditional  toxicological
end points  (see  Scott  and  Sloman,  2004  for  a  review).  Behaviour  is
therefore
 regarded  as  a  sensitive  indicator  of  pollutant  exposure  in
ﬁshes. It  is  also  ecologically  relevant  in  terms  of  bioenergetics  and
the survival  of  ﬁsh  populations.  In  active  ﬁshes  such  as  trout,  indi-
viduals may  spend  around  two  thirds  of  their  daily  energy  budgets
on locomotion  (Priede,  1985 )  as  part  of  essential  behaviours  like
foraging, evading  predators  and  defending  territories.  In  addi-
tion,
 many  ﬁshes  live  in  schools  and  social  interactions  between
conspeciﬁcs often  determine  their  position  in  hierarchies,  and  con-
sequently their  access  to  food.  In  salmonids,  these  interactions  can
be aggressive  and  are  characterised  by  increased  metabolic  rate
and mobilisation  of  energy  reserves;  often  revealing  ﬁtness  dis-
parities
 between  ﬁsh  (Sloman  et  al.,  2000 ;  review  by  Sloman  and
Armstrong, 2002 ).  Metal  exposures  can  have  profound  effects  on
ﬁsh behaviour.  For  example,  trout  exposed  to  dietary  copper  will
reduce
 locomotion  in  order  to  preserve  growth,  body  maintenance,
and tissue  repair  (Handy  et  al.,  1999 )  and  may  even  lose  daily  cir-
cadian rhythms  of  activity  (Campbell  et  al.,  2002 ).  Metals  also  alter
the ability  of  ﬁsh  to  form  social  groups  (e.g.  Cd,  Sloman  et  al.,  2003a,
2003b ; Cu,  Campbell  et  al.,  2005 ).  However,  the  behavioural  effects
of
 ENMs  are  largely  unknown.
The aims  of  this  study  were  ﬁrstly  to  determine  whether  or  not
TiO 2NPs caused  changes  in  the  locomotor  behaviour  or  competi-
tive abilities  of  trout,  and  if  so,  whether  or  not  this  was  associated
with underlying  changes  in  the  animal’s  physiology.  Neurotoxicity
is
 only  one  of  several  possible  explanations  for  changes  in  animal
behaviour and  our  approach  was  therefore  to  take  an  overview  by
measuring Ti  metal  concentrations  in  the  tissues,  adverse  effects
on several  physiological  processes  (osmoregulation,  haematology,
defences
 to  oxidative  stress),  as  well  as  organ  pathologies  including
the brain.  Finally,  the  effects  of  ordinary  titania  on  ﬁsh  behaviours
have not  been  described,  and  a  bulk  TiO 2treatment  was  included  to
revisit the  assumption  that  bulk  titania  is  not  hazardous  to  ﬁshes.

 Materials  and  methods
2.1. Experimental  design
Juvenile
 rainbow  trout  (24.0  ±  3.7  g,  mean  ±  standard  devia-
tion (S.D.),  n  =  32)  were  obtained  from  a  local  supplier  (Torre
ﬁshery, Watchet,  Somerset,  UK)  and  maintained  in  aerated,  dechlo-
rinated, recirculating  Plymouth  tap  water  (see  below  for  ionic
composition)
 for  three  weeks  prior  to  onset  of  experimentation.
The background  concentration  of  Ti  in  the  water  was  below  the
detection limit  (<1.3  /H9262g  l−1,  n  =  6  samples,  see  Section  2.4).  Stock
ﬁsh
 were  fed  twice  daily  with  a  commercial  trout  diet  (EWOS,
Westﬁeld, UK)  until  48  h  prior  to  experimentation.  Fish  were  ran-
domly allocated  to  experimental  glass  tanks  containing  20  l  of
Plymouth  tap  water.  The  continuously  aerated  water  had  the  fol-
lowing  composition  (means  ±  S.D.  n  =  36–156  measurements,  in
mmol l−1):  Ca2+,  0.52  ±  0.07;  K+,  0.06  ±  0.01;  Mg2+,  0.17  ±  0.01;  Na+,
0.75  ±  0.11;  pH  7.2  ±  0.2;  dissolved  oxygen  8.3  ±  0.5  mg  l−1;  NH3,0.008
 ±  0.003  mg  l−1;  temperature,  15  ±  1◦C.  Fish  were  held  in  a
14 h light: 10 h dark photoperiod (350–400 lux  lighting  to  comply
with
 ethical  approval)  and  were  allowed  to  rest  overnight  (unfed)
prior to  the  ﬁrst  dosing.
Fish were  exposed  to  either  a  control  (without  TiO 2),  1  mg  l−1
TiO 2NPs, or  1  mg  l−1bulk  TiO 2in  a  quadruplicate  test  design
(n =  4  replicate  aquaria/treatment;  equating  to  14  ﬁsh/tank  or  56
ﬁsh/treatment)
 for  14  days.  The  exposure  concentrations  were  cho-
sen to  enable  direct  comparison  with  our  previous  studies  on  trout
(Federici  et  al.,  2007 ).  After  14  days  tissues  were  collected  imme-
diately from  8  ﬁsh  (2/tank)  from  each  treatment  to  assess  Ti  metal
concentrations in  the  tissues,  trace  element  homeostasis,  haema-
tology, histopathology, as well as for biochemistry (Sections 2.3,
2.4, 2.5  and  2.6).  At  14  days,  additional  randomly  selected  ﬁsh
from each  treatment  were  also  subject  to  behavioural  measure-
ments. These  were  either  an  assessment  of  spontaneous  swimming
speeds by  video  tracking,  or  competitive  interactions  studies  with
pairs
 of  ﬁsh  from  the  different  treatment  group  to  (Sections  2.7
and 2.8).  No  ﬁsh  was  used  in  both  behavioural  assays.  Plasma
and tissue  samples  were  also  collected  from  ﬁsh  that  were  video
tracked for  biochemical  assays  (Section  2.5).  The  exposures  in  half
the tanks  were  staggered  by  48  h  for  logistical  reasons  to  enable  all
the
 behavioural  measurements  to  be  made,  as  it  was  only  possi-
ble to  perform  behavioural  observations  in  n  =  8  pairs  of  trout  and
record movements  of  n  =  8  ﬁsh  using  video  tracking  software  per
day
 (Sections  2.7  and  2.8).
The dosing  was  achieved  using  the  semi-static  exposure  method
of Federici  et  al.  (2007) ,  with  minor  modiﬁcations.  Brieﬂy,  each  tank
was dosed  with  2  ml  of  the  appropriate  stock  dispersion  (Section
2.2)  with
 the
 aeration
 rapidly
 spreading
 the
 material
 in
 the
 tank
water.
 An  80%  water  change  was  conducted  every  12  h,  and  the
relevant tanks  re-dosed  with  either  1.6  ml  of  bulk  TiO 2or  TiO 2NP
as appropriate.  To  minimise  the  normal  aggressive  behaviours  of
hungry trout  (essential  to  animal  husbandry),  ﬁsh  were  fed  twice
during
 the  experiment  (days  8  and  12)  with  a  1.5%  body  weight
maintenance ration.  This  was  done  post  water  change  but  prior  to
re-dosing to  minimise  the  risk  of  ingestion  of  TiO 2during
 feeding.
All food  was  consumed  immediately  in  all  tanks  on  both  occasions.
The entire  experiment  was  under  ethical  approval  and  ﬁsh  were
subject
 to  independent  health  checks  during  the  work.
2.2.  Titanium  dioxide  stock  suspensions
Nano and  bulk  forms  of  TiO 2were  obtained  from  DeGussa
AG (“Aeroxide”  P25,  supplied  by  Lawrence  Industries,  Tamworth,
UK) and  ACROS  (New  Jersey,  USA)  respectively.  The  P25  material
was
 the  same  batch  used  by  Federici  et  al.  (2007)  and  accord-
ing to  the  manufacturer’s  revised  information  was  25%  rutile:  75%
anatase, >99%  purity  as  TiO 2(maximum  stated  impurity,  1%  Si)
with a  mean  particle  size  of  21  nm  and  a  speciﬁc  surface  area
of 50  ±  15  m2g−1.  The  manufacturer’s  data  on  the  bulk  TiO 2was
limited
 to  purity  information  (98–100.5%  pure  TiO 2).  However,
our scoring  of  the  different  proportions  of  the  crystal  structures
from transmission  electron  micrographs  (TEM,  JEOL  12000EXII,
Tokyo, Japan)  showed  mineral  composition  was  (means  ±  S.D.,
n
 =  10  micrographs)  25  ±  5%  rutile  and  75  ±  5%  anatase.
Stock dispersions  (500  ml)  of  10  g  l−1bulk  TiO 2or  TiO 2NPs
(nominal concentrations)  were  prepared  in  ultrapure  water  (Milli-
Q®,
 Millipore  Corporation)  and  stored  in  acid-washed  Nalgene
bottles. Stocks  were  stirred  overnight  (2400  rpm,  Magnetic  Stir-
rer SM1,  Stuart  Scientiﬁc,  UK)  and  then  subsequently  the  entire
500  ml  was  sonicated  (500  ml,  4◦C,  35  kHz  frequency,  Fisherbrand
FB  11010,  Germany)  for  1  h.  The  sonication  step  was  repeated
each day immediately prior to dosing the experimental tanks to
ensure  reasonably  dispersed  material  was  added  to  the  tanks.

Measurement of  primary  particle  sizes  was  done  manually  from
TEM
 images  of  1  g  l−1dilution  of  the  stocks  above  (to  enable
visualisation of  the  particles).  The  primary  particle  sizes  were
(means ±  S.D.,  n  =  100)  134  ±  42  nm  and  24  ±  10  nm  of  bulk  TiO 2
and TiO 2NPs  respectively.  Dispersion  of  the  10  g  l−1bulk  TiO 2and
TiO 2NPs
 stocks  above  were  conﬁrmed  by  nanoparticle  tracking
analysis of  10  mg  l−1dilutions  of  the  10  g  l−1stocks  that  were  pre-
pared in  ultrapure  water  immediately  after  sonication  (Nanosight
LM 10,  Nanosight,  Salisbury,  UK).  Mean  aggregate  sizes  of  TiO 2were
(means ±  S.D.,  n  =  3):  211  ±  3  nm  and  96  ±  40  nm  for  bulk  TiO 2and
TiO 2NPs
 respectively.  Particle  size  distributions  of  bulk  TiO 2and
TiO 2NPs were  signiﬁcantly  different  (p  =  0.023,  n  =  3,  two  sample
Kolmogorov–Smirnov test).
2.3.
 Haematology  and  plasma  analysis
Haematological analyses  were  performed  according  to  Handy
and Depledge  (1999) .  Brieﬂy,  two  ﬁsh  per  tank  (8/treatment)  were
terminally anaesthetised  in  buffered  MS222,  weighed  and  the  total
length recorded.  Blood  was  immediately  withdrawn  by  caudal
puncture
 with  a  heparinised  syringe  and  sub-samples  of  whole
blood were  collected  in  haematocrit  tubes  for  measurement  of
packed red  blood  cell  volume  after  centrifugation  (13000  rpm,
2 min,  Heraeus  pico  17  microcentrifuge),  and  the  percent  haema-
tocrit (HCT)  recorded.  Then,  20  /H9262l  of  whole  blood  was  diluted
to
 5  ml  with  Drabkin’s  reagent  (Sigma–Aldrich,  UK)  to  measure
haemoglobin (Hb).  A  further  20  /H9262l  of  whole  blood  was  ﬁxed  in
Dacie’s ﬂuid  (0.1  M  tri  sodium  citrate,  2.5  mmol  l−1cresyl  blue,  in
1%
 formalin)  for  red  blood  cell  counts.  The  remaining  blood  was
centrifuged (MSE  microcentaur,  13,000  rpm,  2  min)  and  osmolar-
ity (Osmomat  030,  Gonotec,  UK),  Na+and K+(Model  420  Flame
Photometer, Sherwood  Scientiﬁc  Ltd,  UK)  were  measured  in  the
plasma. After  sampling,  tissues  were  dissected  in  the  order  of  gill,
intestine,
 liver,  spleen,  kidney,  muscle  and  brain  for  trace  element
analysis (Section  2.4).
2.4. Tissue  ion  analysis
The
 methodology  for  Ti  determination  from  TiO 2particles
involved a  modiﬁed  acid  digestion  and  sample  preparation  with
Triton-X100 that  eliminates  the  need  for  strong  hydroﬂuoric  acid
digestion to  dissolve  Ti,  and  enables  the  detection  of  Ti  directly  from
dispersed
 particles  by  inductively  coupled  plasma  optical  emis-
sion spectrophotometry  (ICP-OES,  Ramsden  et  al.,  in  review,  patent
pending). Brieﬂy,  samples  (approximately  0.1–0.5  g)  of  gill  (second
and third  gill  arches),  brain,  liver,  spleen,  kidney,  muscle  (imme-
diately beneath  dorsal  ﬁn)  of  the  ﬁsh,  and  part  of  mid-intestine
were
 oven  dried  to  a  constant  weight  and  digested  (60◦C)  for
2 h  in  1  ml  of  concentrated  HNO 3(68%  nitric  acid,  trace  element
grade, Fisher  Scientiﬁc,  UK).  Following  digestion,  samples  were
diluted to  4  ml  with  Triton-X100  (Sigma,  UK)  and  ultrapure  water,
to give  a  ﬁnal  Triton-X100  concentration  of  2%  in  the  acidiﬁed  sam-
ple
 digest.  Samples  were  stirred  or  vortexed  while  being  drawn
into the  instrument  and  analysed  in  triplicate  for  Ca2+,  Cu,  Fe,  K+,
Mg2+, Na+,  Ti,  and  Zn  by  ICP-OES  (Varian  725-ES).  Matrix  matched
element standards  (acidiﬁed  and  in  2%  Triton-X100)  were  mea-
sured
 every  10–15  samples  to  monitor  the  instrument  for  drift.
Recovery of  metals  from  tissue  digests  were  calculated  for  kid-
ney (0.07–0.12  g  dry  weight,  dw)  and  gill  (0.02–0.06  g  dw)  excised
from
 non-experimental  stock  trout,  digested  as  above  and  spiked
with element  standards  and  either  bulk  TiO 2or  TiO 2NPs.  Calculated
mean recoveries  were  not  signiﬁcantly  different  between  tissues.
Calculated  combined  recoveries  for  both  tissues  were  >90%  for  dis-
solved  metals  (n  =  12  spiked  samples,  data  not  shown).  Recovery
of bulk TiO 2and  TiO 2NPs  from  tissue  digests  were  84.3  ±  2.7%
and  93.9  ±  1.5%,  respectively  (data  are  means  ±  S.D.,  n  =  6).  Theprocedural
 detection  limit  for  Ti  in  acid  digests  of  tissue  sam-
ples
 (n  =  10  procedural  blanks)  was  4.54  /H9262g  l−1,  and  for  a  typical
tissue weight  this  equates  to  around  0.36  /H9262g  g−1dry  weight  of
Ti metal.  All  tissue  metal  concentrations  are  reported  g−1dry
weight.
For
 analysis  of  Ti  concentrations  in  stock  suspensions  aliquots
were diluted  with  Milli-Q  water  and  analysed  directly  by  ICP-
OES and  compared  to  acidiﬁed  (2%  HNO 3)  standards  of  dissolved
Ti metal  made  in  deionised  water.  Similarly,  water  samples
taken from  the  exposure  tanks  were  also  analysed  for  Ca2+,  K+,
Mg2+,
 Na+and  Ti  directly  by  ICP-OES.  The  instrument  detection
limit for  Ti  for  analysis  of  water  samples  and  stock  suspen-
sions (no  Triton  X-100  in  the  standards,  nor  acidiﬁed)  was
1.3 /H9262g  l−1,  calculated  from  3  ×  S.D.  of  n  =  10  measurements  of  the
blank.
2.5. Biochemical  analyses
Biochemical analyses  were  performed  on  selected  tissues  (gill,
brain
 and  kidney)  according  to  methods  outlined  in  Smith  et  al.
(2007) with  minor  modiﬁcation.  A  further  two  ﬁsh  per  tank  were
terminally anaesthetised  and  tissues  excised  (Section  2.3),  then
snap frozen  in  liquid  N2and  stored  at  −80◦C  until  required.  Tis-
sues (30–150  mg)  were  thawed  on  ice  and  then  homogenised
(3
 ×  10  s  with  2  min  rests  at  17,500  rpm,  Cat  X520D  with  a  T6
shaft, medium  speed,  Bennett  &  Co.,  Weston-super-Mare)  in
5 volumes  of  ice  cold  isotonic  buffer  (300  mmol  l−1sucrose,
20 mmol  l−1HEPES,  0.1  mmol  l−1EDTA,  pH  7.8).  Homogenates
were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 2 min and the supernatants
decanted and  stored  at  −80◦C  until  analysed.  Total  glutathione
(GSH) was  quantiﬁed  in  20  /H9262l  of  tissue  supernatant  in  tripli-
cate reactions  in  300  /H9262l  buffer  with  ﬁnal  assay  concentrations
of 76.5  mmol  l−1phosphate  buffer  (pH  7.5),  3.8  mmol  l−1EDTA,
glutathione
 reductase  (0.12  U/ml),  0.6  mmol  l−15′5′-dithiobis-2-
nitrobenzoic acid  (DTNB),  0.2  mmol  l−1ß-Nicotinamide  adenine
dinucleotide phosphate  tetrasodium  salt  (NADPH)  and  absorbance
at 412  nm  monitored  for  20  min  on  a  Versa  Max  microplate  reader
(Molecular
 Devices  (UK)  Ltd,  Wokingham,  UK).  Activity  of  Na+/K+-
ATPase was  measured  in  20  /H9262l  of  supernatants  according  to  an
original protocol  by  Silva  et  al.  (1977)  and  as  described  in  Smith
et
 al.  (2007) .  Brieﬂy,  Na+/K+-ATPase  activity  was  measured  as
the release  of  inorganic  phosphate  from  Na2ATP  after  a  20  min
incubation with/without  the  Na+K+-ATPase  inhibitor,  1  mmol  l−1
ouabain. Following  addition  of  a  colour  reagent  (9.6%  FeSO 4,
1.15% (NH 4)6Mo7O24)  absorbance  at  660  nm  was  recorded  against
0–2
 mmol  l−1phosphate  standards.  The  concentrations  of  thiobar-
bituric reactive  substances  (TBARS)  were  measured  according  to
an original  protocol  in  Camejo  et  al.  (1998) .  In  triplicate  reactions
40 /H9262l  of  supernatants  were  diluted  in  140  /H9262l  of  phosphate  buffer
(100 mmol  l−1,  pH  7.5),  treated  with  10  /H9262l  of  1  mmol  l−1butylated
hydroxytoluene
 to  reduce  spontaneous  oxidation  of  samples  and
de-proteinated with  50  /H9262l  50%  trichloroacetic  acid  (TCA).  Sam-
ples were  centrifuged  13,000  rpm  for  2  min  and  150  /H9262l  supernatant
transferred to  microplate  with  75  /H9262l  of  1.3%  thiobarbituric  acid  in
0.3% NaOH  and  incubated  at  60◦C  for  60  min.  Absorbance  at  530  nm
was
 recorded  against  0–50  /H9262mol  l−11,1,3,3-tetraethoxypropane
standards (Sigma,  UK).  For  all  assays,  appropriate  negative  con-
trols substituting  isotonic  buffer  for  tissue  supernatants  were
included in  every  run.  Data  from  our  laboratory  demonstrates
TiO 2NPs do  not  interfere  with  GSH,  TBARS  and  Na+/K+-ATPase
assays
 used  (data  not  shown).  The  concentration  of  GSH,  TBARS
and activity  of  Na+/K+-ATPase  was  normalised  to  total  pro-
tein  in  the  supernatant  using  the  Bradford’s  reagent  according
to  the  manufacturer’s  protocol  (Product  B6916,  Sigma–Aldrich,
UK).

2.6. Histopathology
At
 day  14  of  the  exposure  two  ﬁsh  per  tank  were  anaesthetised
in buffered  MS222  and  organs  carefully  collected  into  buffered  for-
mal saline  and  processed  to  wax  (Leica  TP1020,  Leica  TPEG1150H,
Wetzlar,
 Germany),  then  7  /H9262m  sections  were  cut  for  routine  histo-
logical examination  as  described  in  Smith  et  al.  (2007) ,  with  minor
modiﬁcations. After  ﬁxation,  the  second  gill  arch  of  each  ﬁsh  was
decalciﬁed (Rapid  Decalciﬁer,  CellPath  plc,  UK)  prior  to  processing
and sectioning.  Gills  were  stained  with  Mallory’s  trichrome.  Spleen,
a
 piece  of  skeletal  muscle  from  the  ﬂank  of  the  ﬁsh,  liver,  pos-
terior kidney  and  whole  brain  were  ﬁxed,  processed,  sectioned,
and then  stained  with  haemotoxylin  and  eosin  to  show  general
architecture. Images  were  recorded  using  an  Olympus  Vanox  –  T
microscope
 and  an  Olympus  digital  camera  (C-2020  Z).  In  gills,
the incidence  of  lesions  was  scored  on  80–100  secondary  lamellae
from two  randomly  selected  primary  ﬁlaments  from  the  middle  of
the second  gill  arch  on  each  ﬁsh.  The  total  number  of  secondary
lamellae with  lesions,  and  the  percentage  incidence  of  each  type  of
lesion were  recorded.  Sagittal  sections  of  whole  brains  were  made
and
 total  dimensions  (height)  of  the  tissue  layers  in  the  mesen-
cephalon and  cerebellum  of  the  brain  were  measured  manually,
in triplicate  from  three  random  images  from  each  ﬁsh.  Fractional
areas of  tissues  in  organs  were  counted  manually  from  randomly
selected areas  on  a  section  from  each  ﬁsh  using  the  point  count-
ing
 method  of  Weibel  et  al.  (1966)  where  the  fractional  volume
(area) Vi=  Pi/PT;  and  Piis  the  number  of  points  counted,  PTis  the
total number  of  points  on  the  counting  grid.  This  method  was  used
to
 calculate  the  proportion  of  red  and  white  pulp  and  sinusoid
space in  the  spleen,  sinusoid  space  in  the  liver  and  fractional  ﬁbre
areas in  skeletal  muscle.  Mean  numbers  of  melanomacrophages
in spleen,  liver  and  kidney  were  counted  in  53,200,  53,200  and
212,400 /H9262m2of  tissue  (i.e.  per  ﬁeld  of  view)  respectively  at  ×400
magniﬁcation.
2.7.  Swimming  behaviour
Following the  14  day  experimental  exposure  swimming
behaviour
 of  trout  was  assessed  in  1  or  2  randomly  selected  ﬁsh  per
tank (n  =  5/6  per  treatment)  with  video  tracking  software  (Ethovi-
sion XT  v.  7.1,  Noldus  Information  Technology,  The  Netherlands).
Fish were  netted  from  the  exposure  aquaria  and  transferred  to
chambers
 (65  cm  ×  40  cm  ×  30  cm)  ﬁlled  with  30  l  of  aquarium
water (for  water  quality  parameters  see  Section  2.1)  and  with  video
cameras directly  overhead.  All  behavioural  measurements  were
carried out  in  clean  water  to  avoid  particle  interference  with  video
recordings. Chambers  were  separated  from  the  rest  of  the  aquarium
by
 a  curtain  to  minimise  disturbance  and  left  to  acclimate  to  con-
ditions overnight  (16  h).  Between  10:00  and  13:00  the  following
day behaviours  were  recorded.  The  software  captured  the  position
of the  ﬁsh  in  each  arena  expressed  as  x,  y  coordinates,  together
with time,  at  a  data  capture  rate  of  6.25  locations  s−1.  During  sub-
sequent
 analysis  of  sample  tracks  all  recordings  were  viewed  and
processed to  correct  miss-tracks  and  remove  noise  which  may
otherwise overestimate  distance  moved  by  removing  small  move-
ments of  <0.4  cm  between  consecutive  time  points.  Positional  data
for
 ﬁsh  were  then  analysed  to  express  ﬁsh  movements  as  total
distance moved,  time  inactive,  mean  velocity  when  active  and
time spent  at  low  (0.4–10  cm  s−1),  medium  (10–20  cm  s−1)  and
high
 speeds  (20+  cm  s−1)  following  an  approach  previously  used
to assess  effects  of  Cu  on  activity  levels  in  trout  (Handy  et  al.,  1999;
Campbell et  al.,  2002 ).
Immediately  after  tracking  had  ﬁnished  some  biochemistry  was
also  performed  on  the  plasma  and  brain  of  ﬁsh.  Fish  were  termi-
nally anaesthetised and plasma isolated from blood (see Section
2.3),  then  the  whole  brain  was  excised  and  homogenised  in  isotonicsucrose
 buffer  and  then  centrifuged  to  isolate  the  supernatant  (see
Section
 2.5).  Activity  of  acetylcholinesterase  (AChE)  was  measured
according to  an  original  protocol  by  Ellman  et  al.  (1961)  adapted  for
the microtitre  plate  by  recording  absorbance  at  405  nm  for  10  min
of a  reaction  mixture  containing  50  /H9262l  of  brain  supernatant,  50  /H9262l
of
 3  mmol  l−1acetylthiocholine  iodide  and  150  /H9262l  of  0.27  mmol  l−1
DTNB. Appropriate  sample  blanks  (isotonic  buffer  without  tissue
homogenate) were  included  in  every  run.  Activity  of  AChE  was
expressed relative  to  protein  concentration  in  each  homogenate,
measured with  Bradford’s  reagent.  Plasma  glucose  concentrations
were
 analysed  according  to  the  manufacturer’s  protocol  (Product
G3293, Sigma–Aldrich,  UK).  Lactic  acid  was  analysed  in  depro-
teinated (equal  volume  of  5%  TCA),  pH  neutralised  serum  according
to Gutmann  and  Wahlefeld  (1974) .  Brieﬂy,  10  /H9262l  serum  was  diluted
in
 200  /H9262l  glycine-hydrazine  buffer  (0.4  M,  pH  9)  containing  10  /H9262l  of
40 mmol  l−1NAD  and  1  U  lactate  dehydrogenase  and  incubated  for
2 h  at  37◦C.  Absorbance  at  340  nm  was  then  compared  to  appropri-
ate 0–8  mmol  l−1lactic  acid  standards.  Appropriate  sample  blanks
(isotonic buffer  without  tissue  homogenate)  were  included  in
every run.
2.8.
 Competitive  interaction
These
 measurements  broadly  followed  the  methodology  of
Sloman  et  al.  (2000) .  Behavioural  interactions  were  observed  in
pairs of  rainbow  trout  from  the  following  treatment  groups:  (1)
aTiO 2NP exposed  ﬁsh  paired  with  a  control  ﬁsh  (n  =  8  pairs),  and
(2)
 a  TiO 2NP  exposed  ﬁsh  paired  with  a  bulk  TiO 2exposed  ﬁsh
(n =  8  pairs).  Following  the  14  day  exposure,  ﬁsh  were  lightly  anaes-
thetised to  facilitate  handling  (50  mg  l−1MS222,  buffered  to  ∼pH
7), weighed  and  total  length  measured.  Size  matched  pairs  of  ﬁsh
(±2
 mm  length,  ±1  g  weight)  were  then  selected  and  the  caudal  ﬁn
injected with  Alcian  blue  to  enable  identiﬁcation  during  observa-
tions, a  process  which  did  not  have  lasting  effects  on  behaviour.  Fish
were revived  in  strongly  aerated  aquarium  water  and  the  two  indi-
viduals of  each  pair  were  placed  in  a  20  l,  aerated,  glass  aquarium
on
 either  side  of  an  opaque  partition.  Again,  no  nanoparticles  were
added to  the  water  to  enable  behavioural  observations.  Once  ﬁsh
had been  allowed  to  rest  and  acclimate  to  the  conditions  for  24  h,
the opaque  partitions  were  removed  and  interactions  between  ﬁsh
observed for a 30 min period commencing from the ﬁrst aggressive
act (bite  or  charge).  Interactions  were  scored  according  to  the  num-
ber of  aggressive  acts  by  each  ﬁsh  (subsequently  identiﬁed  as  the
subordinate or  dominant  ﬁsh  during  data  analysis)  and  the  time  of
retreat of  the  subordinate  ﬁsh  (recorded  as  the  time  after  which
no further  aggressive  behaviours  were  observed).  Subordinate  ﬁsh
typically
 retreated  to  the  surface  of  the  water  and  maintained  this
position in  the  water  column.  Dominant  ﬁsh  were  easily  identiﬁed
in interactions  from  the  timeline  of  aggressive  behaviours  observed
and there  were  typically  large  differences  in  the  observed  numbers
of aggressive  behaviours  between  ﬁsh.
2.9.
 Data  handling  and  statistical  analyses
Statistical
 analyses  were  performed  using  SPSS  (version  18.0  for
Windows). All  data  were  tested  for  normality  (Shapiro–Wilk  test)
and homogeneity  of  variances  (Levene’s  test).  Where  data  were  not
normally
 distributed  log-transformation  was  applied.  Statistically
signiﬁcant differences  between  treatment  groups  were  determined
by ANOVA  with  Tukey’s  test  aposteriori .  Where  log-transformation
failed, the  Kruskal–Wallis  test  or  the  Mann–Whitney  U-test  with
Bonferroni  correction  was  applied  as  appropriate.  A  p  value  of
≤0.05  was  considered  signiﬁcant.  Data  from  competitive  interac-
tions  between  pairs  of  ﬁsh  were  analysed  with  Student’s  t  test  or
Mann–Whitney U-test  as  appropriate.

3. Results
3.1. Conﬁrmation  of  waterborne  TiO2exposure  and  tissue  Ti
accumulation
Waterborne
 exposure  to  TiO 2in  experimental  aquaria  was
conﬁrmed by  ICP-OES  of  water  samples.  Measured  concen-
trations of  Ti  metal  in  water  samples  taken  5  minutes  after
dosing were  (means  ±  S.D.,  n  =  6);  <1.3  /H9262g  l−1,  0.67  ±  0.02  mg  l−1
and
 0.64  ±  0.01  mg  l−1for  control,  bulk  TiO 2and  TiO 2NPs  respec-
tively, corresponding  to  1.11  ±  0.03  mg  l−1and  1.07  ±  0.02  mg  l−1
concentrations of  TiO 2in  the  bulk  and  nano  treatments.  The
exposures were  sub-lethal  as  no  mortalities  occurred  in  any  of
the treatment  groups.  Titanium  metal  concentrations  in  the  tis-
sues
 are
 shown
 in
 Table
 1.
 Overall,
 there
 was
 some
 detectable
background
 Ti  in  the  control  ﬁsh,  but  apart  from  the  gills,  there
were no  increases  in  Ti  concentration  in  the  internal  organs
of the  ﬁsh  in  the  TiO 2treatments  and  no  signiﬁcant  difference
between ﬁsh  exposed  to  bulk  or  nano  TiO 2(no  “material-
type”
 effect).  At  the  end  of  the  exposure  (day  14)  the  gills  of
ﬁsh exposed  to  bulk  or  TiO 2NPs  contained  (means  ±  standard
error (S.E.M.),  n  =  8)  43.3  ±  12.1  and  31.3  ±  8.1  /H9262g  g−1respectively,
compared to  the  controls  (1.4  ±  0.5  /H9262g  g−1);  a  31  and  22  fold
increase
 in  Ti  metal  in/on  the  gill  tissue  compared  to  the  con-
trols (ANOVA,  p  <  0.001).  There  was  no  indication  of  increasing  Ti
concentration in  liver,  spleen,  kidney  and  brain  in  the  ﬁsh  from
the
 TiO 2treatments  compared  to  controls  at  day  14  (ANOVA,
p >  0.05).
3.2.
 Haematology  and  plasma  ions
Fish exposed  to  TiO 2NPs,  but  not  the  bulk  material,  exhib-
ited some  changes  in  haematocrits  and  whole  blood  haemoglobin
compared to  control  ﬁsh  by  the  end  of  the  exposure  (Table  2).
For
 example,  in  ﬁsh  from  the  TiO 2NP  treatment  haematocrit  was
34% compared  to  26  and  28%  in  the  bulk  TiO 2and  control  ﬁsh.
A corresponding  increase  of  whole  blood  haemoglobin  concen-
tration was  also  apparent  in  ﬁsh  exposed  to  TiO 2NPs  (6.9  g  dl−1)
compared to  controls  (5.3  g  dl−1),  a  23%  increase  in  haemoglobin
concentration,
 but  there  was  no  signiﬁcant  increase  in  mean  cor-
puscular haemoglobin  concentration.  The  absence  of  changes  in
these parameters  in  the  ﬁsh  from  the  bulk  TiO 2treatment  com-
pared to  ﬁsh  exposed  to  TiO 2NPs  (Table  2)  also  indicated  a
material-type  effect.  There  were  no  treatment-dependent  changes
in  plasma  ions  (Table  2).  Plasma  osmolarity,  K+and  Na+were  not
signiﬁcantly  different  from  controls  following  exposure  to  bulk
TiO 2or TiO 2NPs.3.3.
 Tissue  electrolytes
Tissue
 electrolyte  and  trace  element  proﬁles  were  generally
unaffected by  either  bulk  or  TiO 2NP  exposure,  apart  from  some
perturbations to  electrolytes  in  the  brain  and  gill  (Fig.  1).  Quality
assurance
 evaluation  indicated  that  usable  data  were  not  obtained
for spleen  Ca2+.  The  concentrations  of  Cu  are  not  shown  in  Fig.  1  due
to the  low  concentration  of  this  essential  element  in  tissues.  Cop-
per concentrations  in  gill,  liver,  kidney,  spleen  and  muscle  were
not affected  by  exposure  to  both  forms  of  TiO 2(data  not  shown).
However,
 the  Cu  concentration  was  signiﬁcantly  higher  (ANOVA,
p =  0.013)  in  brains  of  ﬁsh  exposed  to  TiO 2NPs  (means  ±  S.E.M.,
n =  7/8),  0.11  ±  0.01  /H9262mol  g−1,  compared  to  ﬁsh  exposed  to  bulk
TiO 2, 0.07  ±  0.01  /H9262mol  g−1although  neither  NPs  nor  bulk  expo-
sure
 caused  a  signiﬁcant  change  in  Cu  concentration  compared
to controls,  0.08  ±  0.01  /H9262mol  g−1(ANOVA,  p  >  0.05).  Exposure  to
TiO 2NPs also  caused  disturbances  in  other  brain  electrolytes  with
evidence of  a  material-type  effect  (Fig.  1).  Notably,  brain  K+was
signiﬁcantly elevated  in  ﬁsh  exposed  to  NPs,  839  ±  118  /H9262mol  g−1
compared to  544  ±  50  /H9262mol  g−1and  505  ±  60  /H9262mol  g−1in  controls
and
 ﬁsh  exposed  to  the  bulk  TiO 2,  respectively  (Fig.  1,  ANOVA,
p =  0.011).  Whole  brain  Na+was  elevated  in  the  TiO 2NP  treat-
ment only  compared  to  both  the  bulk,  but  not  the  controls.  In
the case  of  Ca2+,  exposure  to  TiO 2NPs  elevated  Ca2+compared  to
the control  but  there  was  no  material-type  effect.  For  the  trace
metals,
 Zn  concentrations  in  the  brains  of  ﬁsh  exposed  to  TiO 2
NPs (1.48  ±  0.22  /H9262mol  g−1)  were  65%  higher  (ANOVA,  p  =  0.011)
than either  the  controls  (0.91  ±  0.08  /H9262mol  g−1)  or  trout  exposed  to
bulk
 TiO 2(0.89  ±  0.09  /H9262mol  g−1).  Brain  Fe  concentrations  showed
a small  but  statistically  signiﬁcant  (Kruskal–Wallis,  p  =  0.019)
decrease in  the  bulk  TiO 2treatment compared  to  either  the  controls
or TiO 2NP  treatment.
The concentration  of  Mg2+in  the  gill  of  trout  exposed  to  1  mg  l−1
TiO 2NPs
 (49.4  ±  1.3  /H9262mol  g−1)  was  signiﬁcantly  lower  than  gills
from the  controls  (55.8  ±  2.2  /H9262mol  g−1)  or  from  the  bulk  material
treatment (54.4  ±  1.7  /H9262mol  g−1,  ANOVA,  p  =  0.041).  Consequently,
there was  a  material-type  effect  associated  with  TiO 2NPs.  The  con-
centrations of  the  other  ions  in  the  gill  were  not  altered  by  either
bulk
 or  TiO 2NP  exposure  (Fig.  1).
3.4. Biochemical  markers  of  oxidative  injury  and  ionoregulatory
dysfunction
Tissue  concentrations  of  total  glutathione,  TBARS  and  Na+/K+-
ATPase activity  are  shown  in  Fig.  2.  Overall,  there  was  some
evidence of  oxidative  disturbances  in  the  brain  and  kidney,  but  no
effects
 on  the  gill.  The  concentration  of  total  GSH  in  the  gill  and  kid-
ney was  not  affected  by  TiO 2NPs  exposure  (Fig.  2,  ANOVA,  p  >  0.05).
However there  was  a  statistically  signiﬁcant  increase  in  GSH  in
brains of  ﬁsh  exposed  to  TiO 2NPs  or  bulk  TiO 2compared  to  con-
trols. There  was  also  evidence  for  a  material  type-effect.  The  con-
centration
 of  GSH  was  signiﬁcantly  higher  in  brains  in  ﬁsh  exposed
to NPs  compared  to  bulk.  The  GSH  concentration  in  brains  of  ﬁsh
exposed to  TiO 2NPs  was  22.5  ±  1.0  nmol  mg−1protein  compared
to 18.7  ±  0.2  nmol  mg−1protein  and  20.4  ±  0.6  nmol  GSH  mg−1pro-
tein
 in  brains  of  controls  and  ﬁsh  exposed  to  bulk  TiO 2, respectively
(Kruskal–Wallis, p  =  0.001).
There was  also  an  increase  of  TBARS  in  the  brains  of  ﬁsh
exposed
 to  TiO 2NPs  only,  indicating  a  material-type  effect  in
this organ  (Fig.  2).  TBARS  in  the  brains  of  ﬁsh  exposed  to  TiO 2
NPs was  elevated  to  1.7  ±  0.2  nmol  mg−1protein,
 compared  to
controls, 1.0  ±  0.2  nmol  mg−1protein  and  bulk  TiO 2exposed  ﬁsh
0.7  ±  0.1  nmol  mg−1protein  (ANOVA,  p  <  0.001).  The  concentration
of TBARS in kidney was also signiﬁcantly increased in ﬁsh exposed
to  TiO 2NPs  or  bulk  TiO 2compared  to  the  controls  (Kruskal–Wallis,

the  bulk  and  nano  TiO 2treatments  showed  pathology.  The  injuries
included hyperplasia  of  the  primary  and  secondary  lamellae,  evi-
dence of  oedema  and  club  tips  in  the  secondary  lamellae,  as  well  as
swollen
 mucocytes  in  the  gill  epithelium  (Fig.  3).  A  quantitative
analysis of  the  incidence  of  gill  injuries  conﬁrmed  these  obser-
vations with  a  statistically  signiﬁcant  increase  in  the  incidence
of hyperplasia  (means  ±  S.E.M.,  n  =  8)  in  the  TiO 2NP  treatment
(7.4 ± 0.6%), and the bulk TiO 2treatment (6.5  ±  0.6%)  compared  to
the
 unexposed  control  (0.7  ±  0.3%)  at  day  14  (ANOVA,  p  <  0.001,
Fig.  3).  The  incidence  of  club  tips  on  the  lamellae  increased  from
(means ±  S.E.M.,  n  =  8)  2.2  ±  0.7%  in  the  controls  to  11.1  ±  1.0  and
18.1 ±  1.4%  in  the  bulk  and  nano  TiO 2treatments  respectively,
and with a statistically signiﬁcant material-type effect (greater in
ﬁsh exposed  to  TiO 2NPs,  ANOVAs,  p  <  0.001).  Similarly,  the  inci-
dence of  swollen  mucocytes  increased  from  (means  ±  S.E.M.,  n  =  8)
2.7 ±  0.7%  in  the  controls  to  17.9  ±  2.0  and  11.9  ±  2.0%  in  the  bulkand  nano  TiO 2treatments  respectively,  also  with  a  statistically  sig-
niﬁcant material-type  effect  (higher  incidence  in  ﬁsh  exposed  to
bulk TiO 2,  ANOVAs,  p  <  0.001).  There  were  also  statistically  signiﬁ-
cant
 increases  in  the  incidence  of  aneurisms  on  the  lamellae,  fusion
of lamellae  and  necrotic  cells  in  the  gill  epithelium  with  both  the
bulk and  nano  treatments,  but  these  all  remained  below  a  5%  inci-
dence rate  (data  not  shown).
There were  some  subtle  perturbations  in  the  structure  of  spleen
in
 ﬁsh  exposed  to  either  1  mg  l−1TiO 2NPs  or  the  bulk  material
at day  14  (Fig.  4).  There  was  generally  no  material-type  effect
in the  spleen  structure  with  both  bulk  and  nano  forms  caus-
ing similar  changes  in  the  spleen.  The  fractional  volume  of  red
pulp was signiﬁcantly decreased in trout exposed to bulk and NPs
with a  concomitant  increase  in  sinusoid  space  when  compared
to controls  (Fig.  4,  ANOVAs,  p  =  0.001).  Notably,  there  was  also  a
statistically signiﬁcant  increase  in  number  of  melanomacrophages

were
 observed  in  ﬁsh  exposed  to  TiO 2bulk  and  TiO 2NPs  (p  ≤  0.05).  There  was  no  signiﬁcant  change  in  the  proportion  of  white  pulp  (WP).  Panel  (D)  fractional  volume  of

(ANOVA,
 p  <  0.001).  This  melanomacrophage  inﬁltrate  was  greater
in the  nano  than  bulk  treatment  (statistically  signiﬁcant  material-
type effect).
Liver and  kidney  were  also  examined.  The  livers  of  ﬁsh  exposed
to
 either  bulk  or  nano  TiO 2showed  very  minor  changes  com-
pared to  the  controls  with  some  mild  lipidosis,  but  there  were
increases of  melanomacrophage  deposits.  For  the  latter,  the  num-
ber
 of  deposits  (means  ±  S.E.M,  counts/ﬁeld  of  view  of  53,200  /H9262m2,
n =  8)  increased  from  6.5  ±  1.3  (control)  to  17.0  ±  0.7  (bulk)  and
18.0 ±  3.0  (TiO 2NPs). The  differences  from  the  control  were  sta-
tistically signiﬁcant,  but  with  no  material-type  effect  (ANOVA,
p <  0.05).  The  liver  also  showed  a  small  increase  in  the  propor-
tion
 of  sinusoid  space  of  a  few  percent  in  both  TiO 2treatments
compared to  the  controls  (data  not  shown).  In  the  kidney,  both
bulk and  nano  TiO 2treatments  showed  some  injuries  including
mild necrosis  of  a  few  individual  renal  tubules  with  separation
of the epithelium, and enlargement of the Bowman’s space; but
with no  clear  material-type  effect  in  these  injuries  at  day  14
(data not  shown).  The  kidney  also  showed  melanomacrophage
activity, with  a  statistically  signiﬁcant  increase  in  number
of melanomacrophages  (means  ±  S.E.M,  counts/ﬁeld  of  view  of
212,400
 /H9262m2,  n  =  8)  from  230.3  ±  18.0  (control)  to  295.3  ±  15.2
(bulk) and  295.5  ±  13.2  (TiO 2NPs)  (ANOVA,  p  <  0.001).  There  was
no material-type  effect  in  the  melanomacrophage  inﬁltrate  in  the
kidney.
Excitable tissues  were  also  examined  including  the  skeletal
muscle and  the  brain.  The  muscle  of  control  ﬁsh  showed  normal
morphology  and  the  muscle  for  both  bulk  and  nano  treatmentsshowed
 increased  extracellular  space  around  the  muscle  ﬁbre
bundles. This  was  reﬂected  in  a  small  but  statistically  signiﬁcant
decrease in  the  proportional  area  of  the  muscle  as  ﬁbre  bundles
by day  14  (means  ±  S.E.M,  %  area,  n  =  8)  from  71.4  ±  1.3  (control)
to 60.4  ±  2.6  (bulk)  and  61.0  ±  2.2  (TiO 2NPs).  The  differences  from
the
 control  were  statistically  signiﬁcant,  but  with  no  material-type
effect (ANOVA,  p  <  0.05).
The brains  from  the  control  ﬁsh  were  normal,  and  the  gross
morphology of  brains  of  trout  exposed  to  either  bulk  or  nano
TiO 2was
 mainly  normal,  although  very  subtle  structural  changes
in the  brain  were  observed.  The  mesencephalon  was  normal  in
ﬁsh from  all  treatments  at  day  14  (data  not  shown)  with  the
exception
 of  a  contraction  in  the  St.  periventricular  layer  in  trout
exposed to  TiO 2NPs  only  (%  thickness  of  the  mesencephalon  lay-
ers, means  ±  S.E.M.,  n  =  8);  31.2  ±  1.2  (control),  31.9  ±  1.0  (bulk)  and
27.0 ±  1.2  (TiO 2NPs).  This  change,  although  small,  was  statisti-
cally signiﬁcant  ANOVA,  p  =  0.005).  In  the  cerebellum  some  subtle
changes
 in  the  proportions  of  the  tissue  layers  were  also  observed,
with a  slight  but  statistically  signiﬁcant  (ANOVA,  p  =  0.004)  thick-
ening of  the  outer  capsule  layer  of  the  brain  in  ﬁsh  exposed  to  the
bulk TiO 2only;  with  the  relative  thickness  of  the  capsule  layer
being 1.9  ±  0.2,  2.8  ±  0.5  and  1.7  ±  0.2%  in  control,  bulk  and  NP
exposed
 ﬁsh  respectively.  Notably,  enlarged  blood  vessels  were  also
observed on  the  surface  of  the  cerebellum  in  ﬁsh  exposed  to  both
nano and  bulk  TiO 2(Fig.  5).

for time  spent  moving  at  different  speeds  a  signiﬁcant  shift  to
decreased time  spent  moving  at  high  speed  was  observed  in  ﬁsh
exposed to  TiO 2NPs  compared  to  controls  but  there  was  no  evi-
dence
 of  a  material-type  effect.  Activity  proﬁles  of  trout  from

periods (<0.4  cm  s−1)  and  moving  at  low  speed  (0.4–10  cm  s−1)
with less  time  spent  moving  at  medium  (10–20  cm  s−1)  and
high
 (>20  cm  s−1)  speeds  (Fig.  6).  There  was  no  signiﬁcant  dif-
ference in  time  spent  being  inactive  (ANOVA,  p  =  0.283),  or  time
moving at  low  (ANOVA,  p  =  0.468)  and  medium  speeds  (ANOVA,
p =  0.262)  in  ﬁsh  exposed  to  TiO 2NPs  compared  to  controls
(Fig.  6). However, time spent moving at high velocity (>20 cm s−1)
was signiﬁcantly  lower  in  ﬁsh  exposed  to  TiO 2NPs  compared
to control  ﬁsh  (ANOVA,  p  =  0.036,  Fig.  6).  Time  spent  moving  at
high speed  in  ﬁsh  exposed  to  bulk  TiO 2was  not  signiﬁcantly
different from  controls  or  ﬁsh  exposed  to  TiO 2NPs  (ANOVA,
p
 >  0.05).
Analysis of  AChE  activity  in  brain  of  ﬁsh  assayed  immediately
after tracking  ﬁsh  movements  indicated  no  signiﬁcant  difference
between ﬁsh  exposed  to  controls,  bulk  TiO 2and  TiO 2NPs  (ANOVA,
p =  0.078).  Measured  AChE  activity  levels  were  (means  ±  S.E.M.,

tively. Plasma  glucose  and  serum  lactate  concentrations  were
also not  signiﬁcantly  different  in  ﬁsh  from  different  treat-
ment groups (ANOVAs, p > 0.05). Glucose concentrations were
3.66 ±  0.27,  3.16  ±  0.18  and  3.66  ±  0.3  mmol  l−1and  lactate  concen-
trations 4.1  ±  0.8,  3.0  ±  0.9  and  1.9  ±  0.6  mmol  l−1in  ﬁsh  exposed  to

 Behavioural  observations  of  competitive  interactions
Behavioural observations  of  competitive  interactions  of  trout
indicated
 no  statistically  signiﬁcant  effect  of  exposure  to  TiO 2
NPs on  competitive  ability  compared  to  controls  or  bulk  TiO 2.
Interactions between  ﬁsh  were  usually  characterised  by  rapid
engagement, the  ﬁrst  aggressive  act  typically  occurring  1–4  min
following
 removal  of  the  partition,  escalation  of  the  contest  and
withdrawal of  the  subordinate  ﬁsh  from  the  interaction  within
the 30  min  period  of  observation.  Dominant  and  subordinate  ﬁsh
were identiﬁable  in  all  contests  with  the  exception  of  two  pairs
of ﬁsh  which  did  not  interact  during  the  3  h  period  allocated  for
behavioural
 observations;  one  pair  each  from  (a)  control  paired
with NP  exposed  ﬁsh  and  (b)  bulk  exposed  paired  with  a  NP
exposed ﬁsh.  These  ﬁsh  were  removed  from  subsequent  analy-
sis leaving  n  =  14  remaining  pairs  of  ﬁsh.  Where  TiO 2NP  exposed
ﬁsh were  paired  with  control  ﬁsh  the  outcome  of  the  interaction
was
 not  affected  by  exposure:  in  3/7  interactions  the  TiO 2NP-
exposed ﬁsh  emerged  as  the  dominant  ﬁsh  in  the  interaction.  The
number of  aggressive  acts  in  30  min  was  also  not  affected  by  expo-
sure (means  ±  S.E.M.,  Student’s  t  test,  n  =  3/4,  p  =  0.57),  83  ±  41  and
123
 ±  55  aggressive  acts  in  control  ﬁsh  and  dominant  TiO 2NP-
exposed ﬁsh,  respectively.  Time  of  retreat  of  the  subordinate  ﬁsh
was also  not  signiﬁcantly  different  (means  ±  S.E.M.,  n  =  3/4,  Stu-
dent’s t  test,  p  =  0.19),  15  ±  7  and  5  ±  2  min  in  subordinate  control
and NP  exposed  ﬁsh  respectively.  Where  a  TiO 2NP-exposed  ﬁsh
was
 paired  with  a  bulk  material-exposed  ﬁsh,  treatment  was  also
not a  factor  in  outcome  of  interaction;  in  4/7  interactions  the  TiO 2
NP-exposed ﬁsh  emerged  as  the  dominant  ﬁsh  in  the  interaction.

4. Discussion
The present  study  has  demonstrated  that  exposure  to  1  mg  l−1
TiO 2NPs
 for  14  days  can  cause  changes  in  the  locomotor  activity
of rainbow  trout  which  involve  the  exposed-ﬁsh  spending  propor-
tionally less  time  at  high  swimming  speeds  compared  to  controls.
Notably, there  was  no  clear  material-type  effect  on  locomotor  activ-
ities, but  both  materials  caused  gill  injury.  The  decrease  in  the
proportion
 of  time  spent  at  high  swimming  speeds  is  most  easily
explained by  respiratory  hypoxia  rather  than  neurotoxicity,  with
increases of  HCT,  Hb  and  changes  in  the  proportion  of  red  pulp
in
 the  spleen  indicating  some  physiological  compensation;  albeit
with some  subtle  differences  between  the  bulk  and  nano  TiO 2in
this response.  The  animals  remained  able  to  compete  in  aggres-
sive interactions,  and  exposure  to  either  bulk  or  nano  TiO 2had  no
effect on  the  outcome  of  these  bouts.  Overall,  the  data  shows  that
trout
 will  moderate  their  swimming  speed  in  response  to  water-
borne TiO 2exposure,  but  retain  the  physiological  capacity  for  short
periods of  energetically  demanding  activities  such  as  defending
themselves in  a  dominance  contest.

 exposure  to  either  bulk  or  nano  TiO 2was  charac-
terised by  some  Ti  accumulation  on/in  the  gill  tissue,  but  with  no
measurable increases  in  the  Ti  concentrations  in  the  internal  organs
(Table 1).  Our  previous  study  on  rainbow  trout  (Federici  et  al.,
2007 )  also  found  no  treatment-dependent  increases  in  Ti  metal
concentrations in  the  internal  organs.  However  unlike  the  present
study, Federici  et  al.  (2007)  did  not  detect  measurable  increases
in the  gill  tissue.  This  difference  is  partly  due  to  the  lower  back-
ground Ti  concentrations  in  the  ﬁsh  used  here  (Ti  concentrations
vary
 with  the  source  and  feeding  history  of  the  ﬁshes,  see  discus-
sion in  Ramsden  et  al.,  2009 );  but  mainly  due  to  improvements
in the  ICP-MS  method  in  the  present  study  which  enable  differ-
ences in  the  gill  to  be  detected  that  could  not  be  measured  before.
Nonetheless,
 the  Ti  concentrations  on/in  the  gills  (Table  1)  remain
at /H9262g  g−1concentrations  for  an  exposure  at  mg  l−1levels,  indicat-
ing only  a  fraction  of  the  exposure  dose  became  associated  with
gill tissue.  The  absence  of  increases  in  the  Ti  concentrations  of  the
internal organs,  and  only  modest  increases  in/on  the  gill  tissue  of
trout,
 from  waterborne  TiO 2exposure  is  consistent  with  Johnston
et al.  (2010)  who  conducted  Coherent  Anti-Stokes  Raman  Scat-
tering (CARS)  microscopy  on  the  gill  of  rainbow  trout  exposed  to
5 mg  l−1TiO 2NPs  for  10  days.  Johnston  et  al.  (2010)  showed  that
(for TiO 2NPs  at  least)  most  of  the  TiO 2aggregates  on  the  surface  of
the
 gill  epithelium,  with  the  occasional  aggregate  appearing  within
the secondary  lamellae.  Nonetheless,  exposure  in  this  study  was
conﬁrmed by  measurable  Ti  concentrations  in  the  exposure  tanks,
and similar  to  Federici  et  al.  (2007) ,  histological  examination  of
the
 gills  of  ﬁsh  conﬁrmed  respiratory  irritation  in  trout  exposed  to
bulk and  nano  TiO 2.  Gills  showed  an  increased  incidence  of  swollen
mucocytes that  was  greatest  for  the  bulk  material  (Fig.  3).  The
mucus
 defences  were  partially  successful  with  a  lower  incidence
of clubbed  tips  in  the  bulk  compared  to  nano  TiO 2treatment.  The
hyperplasia in  the  gill  epithelium  of  ﬁsh  exposed  to  TiO 2NPs
 or
bulk TiO 2compared  to  controls  (Fig.  3)  was  similar  to  the  ﬁndings
of  Federici  et  al.  (2007) .  Gill  injury  has  also  been  reported  in  other
species of ﬁsh e.g. Cyprinus carpio , exposed to waterborne TiO 2NPs
(Hao  et  al.,  2009 ).The
 gill  is  an  important  organ  for  both  osmoregulation  and  respi-
ratory
 gas  exchange.  In  the  present  study  the  general  absence  of
disturbances to  plasma  ions  and  osmolarity  (Table  2),  the  nor-
mal gill  tissue  Na+and  K+concentrations  (Fig.  1A),  as  well  as  the
absence of  inhibition  of  branchial  (or  renal)  Na+/K+-ATPase  (Fig.  2C)
indicates
 that  the  gill  injury  was  not  sufﬁcient  to  cause  major
osmoregulatory disturbances  within  14  days  (similar  to  the  con-
clusions of  Federici  et  al.,  2007 ).  However,  thickening  of  the  gill
epithelium due  to  hyperplasia  and  oedema  (Fig.  3)  will  increase  the
diffusion distance  for  gas  exchange;  and  even  small  increases  can
have
 profound  effects  on  the  efﬁciency  of  oxygen  transfer  across
the gill  (Malte,  1992 ).  Gill  injury  from  metal  exposures  is  known  for
being associated  with  a  decrease  in  arterial  oxygen  tension  (PaO2),
which may  be  recoverable  depending  on  the  extent  of  the  injury
(e.g.,
 Zn,  Lappivaara  et  al.,  1995 ).  Decreases  in  PaO2in  ﬁsh  exposed
to Ag  NPs  have  also  been  reported  (Bilberg  et  al.,  2010 ).  It  therefore
seems probable  that  the  gill  injury  reported  here  (Fig.  3)  would
cause some  hypoxia.
A 5%  increase  in  HCT  values,  and  a  subtle  but  statistically  sig-
niﬁcant increase  of  1.7  g  dl−1in  the  haemoglobin  concentration  of
blood
 was  observed  in  the  TiO 2NP  treatment  compared  to  con-
trols (Table  2);  partly  supporting  the  idea  of  compensation  for  a
systemic hypoxia.  A  trend  of  increasing  haemoglobin  (not  statis-
tically signiﬁcant)  was  noted  by  Federici  et  al.  (2007) .  However,
the variations  in  haematology  in  both  studies  are  within  physio-
logical
 limits.  For  example,  temporal  changes  in  the  control  HCTs
in Federici  et  al.  (2007)  was  around  6%,  exceeding  the  increase
observed here.  Interestingly,  despite  similarities  in  the  incidence
of
 hyperplasia  in  the  gill  caused  by  exposure  to  TiO 2NPs  or  bulk
TiO 2(Fig.  3),  and  the  subtly  increased  HCT  values  (Table  2);  this
effect was  only  apparent  in  trout  exposed  to  TiO 2NPs and  not  the
bulk TiO 2.  However,  both  materials  resulted  in  comparable  pro-
portional decreases  in  the  area  of  red  pulp  in  the  spleen  (Fig.  4),
consistent
 with  the  release  of  red  cells  from  the  spleen  stores
into the  circulation  in  response  to  hypoxia  (see  Handy  et  al.,  2011
for  discussion  on  the  spleen).  However,  the  spleen  of  the  NP-
exposed ﬁsh  showed  more  melanomacrophage  inﬁltrate  than  the
controls or  bulk  material  treatment.  These  deposits  reﬂect  the
normal
 activity  of  the  spleen  in  processing  damaged  blood  cells,
indicating the  spleen  was  working  harder  to  maintain  the  nor-
mal counts  of  circulating  blood  cells,  especially  in  the  NP-exposed
ﬁsh.
Regardless
 of  the  material-type,  the  haematological  response
appears to  have  been  successful  in  terms  of  decreasing  any  hypoxia-
driven oxidative  stress.  Hypoxia  is  known  to  cause  oxidative  stress
in the  internal  tissues  of  ﬁsh,  (Luschak  and  Bagnyukova,  2007 ),
and exposure  to  Ag  NPs  appears  to  reduce  the  hypoxia  tolerance
of
 the  Eurasian  perch  Perca  ﬂuviatilis  (Bilberg  et  al.,  2010 ).  In  the
present study  biomarkers  of  oxidative  stress  in  the  gill  (total  glu-
tathione, TBARS,  Fig.  2)  did  not  change,  presumably  because  this
external epithelia  was  bathed  in  well  oxygenated  water  throughout
the experiment.  In  Federici  et  al.  (2007)  the  branchial  glutathione
only
 increased  by  1  /H9262mol  g−1tissue  (probably  not  physiologically
important), and  the  TBARS  increased  by  about  3  nmol  mg  protein−1
due to  TiO 2NP  exposure.  These  are  arguably  only  subtle  differences
in the  biochemical  responses  of  the  gills  between  the  two  stud-
ies,
 and  in  the  absence  of  glutathione  depletion  in  the  gills,  both
studies suggest  that  oxidative  stress  was  not  the  likely  cause  of
gill pathology.  However,  the  situation  was  different  for  the  inter-
nal
 organs,  with  both  the  kidney  and  brain  showing  increases  in
TBARS (Fig.  2)  without  measurable  increases  in  brain  Ti  concen-
tration (Table  1).  Federici  et  al.  (2007)  also  observed  elevations  of
TBARS  in  the  brain  without  changes  in  Ti  concentration  of  the  organ.
This  is  suggestive  of  an  indirect  effect  of  TiO 2NPs  on  the  brain  via
systemic hypoxia. The brain, being a critical organ to protect from
hypoxia,  also  showed  an  increased  total  glutathione  pool;  with  the
126 D.  Boyle  et  al.  /  Aquatic  Toxicology  126 (2013) 116–  127
biggest changes  in  the  TiO 2NP-exposed  ﬁsh  (Fig.  2)  consistent  with
the
 material-type  effect  in  the  haematological  response  above.
The absence  of  changes  in  oxidative  stress  parameters  in  the
external epithelia  (no  change  in  branchial  total  glutathione  or
TBARS, Fig.  2),  and  the  moderately  low  lux  of  the  laboratory  lighting
used
 in  the  present  study,  suggests  that  ultraviolet  (UV)  activa-
tion of  reactive  oxygen  species  generation  by  the  TiO 2NPs  was  not
likely in  the  experiment.  Using  the  same  TiO 2NPs,  Reeves  et  al.
(2008) found  that  relatively  high  UVA  dose  rates  of  2.5  kJ  m−2were
needed to  produce  oxidative  DNA  damage  in  ﬁsh  skin  cell  lines
(GFSk-S1
 cells).  The  modest  changes  in  oxidative  stress  param-
eters in  the  internal  organs  (Fig.  2)  are  therefore  best  explained
by some  systemic  hypoxia  associated  with  gill  injury.  Ecologically,
rainbow trout  prefer  shade  and  areas  of  low  light  in  rivers  and
one
 might  therefore  expect  this  ﬁsh  to  avoid  the  worst  of  any
theoretical UV-dependent  reactive  oxygen  releases  from  TiO 2in
the wild.
4.2. Effects  of  TiO2on  behaviour  of  trout
Rainbow
 trout  can  spend  two  thirds  or  more  of  their  daily  energy
expenditure on  swimming,  and  consequently,  changes  in  locomo-
tor activity  could  have  profound  effects  on  their  overall  energy
budget and  probability  of  survival  (Priede,  1985 ).  From  a  biome-
chanics perspective,  high  speed  swimming  is  (exponentially)  much
more
 energetically  expensive  than  low  or  moderate  speeds,  and  ﬁsh
therefore rarely  attain  maximum  velocities  at  the  limit  of  aerobic
metabolic scope  (Young  et  al.,  1972;  Priede,  1977 ).  This  is  reﬂected
in
 the  normal  locomotor  activity  pattern  reported  here,  with  ﬁsh
spending most  of  their  time  at  low  or  moderate  speeds,  and  only
with the  occasional  short  burst  of  high  speed  swimming  (Fig.  6C).
This observation  is  also  consistent  with  our  previous  recordings  for
juvenile rainbow  trout  (Handy  et  al.,  1999;  Campbell  et  al.,  2002 ).
In
 ﬁsh  exposed  to  TiO 2NPs  only,  the  proportion  of  time  spent
swimming at  high  speed  (>20  cm  s−1)  was  signiﬁcantly  decreased
compared to  the  unexposed  controls,  although  there  was  no  over-
all difference  in  mean  swimming  speed  distributions  between  bulk
and nano  TiO 2(Fig.  6C).  Consequently,  the  mean  velocity  of  ﬁsh
when
 active  was  unchanged  (Fig.  6B).  This  effect  of  metals  has  pre-
viously been  reported  in  ﬁsh  exposed  to  dietary  Cu  where  mean
swimming speeds  and  total  distanced  moved  show  limited  or  no
overall change,  but  the  ﬁsh  had  altered  swimming  speed  distri-
butions
 in  favour  of  lower  speeds  (Handy  et  al.,  1999;  Campbell
et al.,  2002 ).  This  phenomenon  has  been  explained  in  terms  of  a
metabolic trade  off  in  the  energy  budget  of  the  animal,  where  Cu-
exposed ﬁsh  redirect  energy  from  locomotion  to  tissue  repair  in
order to  maintain  normal  growth  and  physiology  during  chronic
Cu
 exposure  (Handy  et  al.,  1999 ).  In  the  case  of  waterborne  TiO 2
exposure, the  situation  is  analogous  in  that  the  ﬁsh  have  damaged
gills (Fig.  3)  and  are  evidently  expending  energy  to  maintain  the
circulating red  blood  cells  (Table  2);  and  probably  on  osmoregula-
tion to  keep  all  the  tissue  electrolytes  generally  normal  (Fig.  1)  in
the
 face  of  a  leaky  (damaged)  gill  epithelium.  The  overall  strategy
of TiO 2-exposed  ﬁsh  appeared  to  be  effective  because  the  ﬁsh  had
normal blood  glucose  concentrations,  and  did  not  show  elevations
of plasma  lactate  (i.e.,  no  build-up  of  an  oxygen  debt)  at  the  end  of
the
 experiment.
However, the  question  arises  as  to  whether  the  TiO 2-exposed
ﬁsh “voluntarily”  adopt  this  behavioural  strategy  of  less  time  at
high
 swimming  speeds,  or  are  simply  forced  to  do  it  because  they
are physiologically  incapable  of  bursts  of  heavy  exercise.  The  latter
seems unlikely  because  there  was  no  effect  of  TiO 2on
 competitive
ability. The  duration  of  each  contest,  the  level  of  aggression  and  the
outcome  were  not  affected  by  TiO 2NP  exposure.  Previous  studies
on exercise physiology have also demonstrated that ﬁsh can sustain
considerable  loss  of  respiratory  function  before  swimming  ability  iscompromised.
 For  example,  Duthie  and  Hughes  (1987)  report  >30%
reduction
 in  functional  gill  area  was  required  to  reduce  maximum
sustained speed  in  exercised  ﬁsh.
4.3.
 Neurotoxicity  and  behaviour
An alternative  hypothesis  to  gill  injury  (systemic  hypoxia  risk)
driving the  haematological  and  behavioural  changes  observed  in
the
 present  study  is  direct  neurotoxicity  of  TiO 2NPs.  However,
several lines  of  evidence  suggest  this  is  unlikely,  including  no
detectable increases  of  Ti  in  the  brain  tissue,  although  secondary
neurotoxicity associated  with  hypoxia  remains  possible.  The  lev-
els of  pathologies  observed  in  brains  were  minimal,  and  unlikely
to
 compromise  the  role  of  the  cerebellum  (hind  brain)  in  co-
ordinating motor  functions.  The  presence  of  enlarged  blood  vessels
on the  surface  of  the  cerebellum  (Fig.  5)  may  not  be  pathological,  but
simply part  of  a  prolonged  vasodilation  response  to  ensure  oxygen
supply to  the  brain  to  compensate  for  the  gill  damage.  The  con-
traction of  the  St.  periventricular  layer  in  the  mesencephalon  was
most
 likely  due  to  a  simple  ﬂuid  shift,  from  the  tissue  layer  into  the
underlying ventricle.  This  observation  and  the  elevation  of  the  main
electrolytes in  the  brain  tissue  of  the  TiO 2NP-treated  ﬁsh  (Fig.  1)
suggest some  dehydration.  If  this  explanation  is  correct,  there  is
also
 a  theoretically  possible  that  an  electrolyte  and  ﬂuid  imbalance
in the  brain  could  also  affect  motor  outputs  (locomotion).  In  clin-
ical terms,  these  sorts  of  injuries  might  cause  some  discomfort  or
delay
 in  processing  of  stimuli  (i.e.,  a  ﬁsh  with  a  “headache”,  but  still
functioning behaviourally).
The data  supporting  electrical  properties  (Na+/K+-ATPase,  ratio
of Na+:  K+in  the  tissue)  and  activity  of  AChE  in  the  brains  of  ﬁsh
exposed to  TiO 2NPs  were  normal.  Loss  of  sympathetic  tone  (i.e.,
pathology
 of  motor  neurons  in  the  peripheral  nervous  system)  also
seems unlikely  with  no  evidence  of  muscle  atrophy.  The  spleen  also
retained its  ability  to  change  the  proportions  of  the  red  and  white
pulp; a  function  that  can  only  be  achieved  with  intact  sympathetic
control of  the  organ.  Windeatt  and  Handy  (2012)  also  recently
showed
 no  effects  on  action  potential  generation  with  direct  appli-
cations of  1  mg  l−1TiO 2NPs  onto  isolated  crab  nerve  preparations
in vitro.
4.4.  Conclusions
In conclusion,  this  study  demonstrates  that  juvenile  rainbow
trout exposed  to  1  mg  l−1TiO 2NPs  for  14  days  spend  propor-
tionally
 less  time  at  high  swimming  speeds.  The  cause  of  this
change in  swimming  speed  distribution  is  more  easily  explained
by damage  to  the  gill  epithelium  with  a  subsequent  hypoxia  rather
than direct  neurotoxicity  of  TiO 2.  Indirect  toxicity  through  hypoxia
is
 supported  by  a  decrease  in  the  red  pulp  in  the  spleen  and  a
compensatory increase  in  HCT.  Subtle  changes  in  brain  histol-
ogy with  enlarged  vasculature  are  also  consistent  with  systemic
hypoxia. While  there  was  no  overall  material-type  effect  on  animal
behaviour,
 there  were  some  differences  between  bulk  and  nano
TiO 2on the  organ  pathologies,  as  well  as  the  underlying  haema-
tological responses  of  the  ﬁsh;  with  the  NP-exposed  ﬁsh  generally
working harder  to  compensate  for  the  disturbances.  The  reasons
for
 these  material-type  effects  in  the  cardiovascular  physiology  of
ﬁshes require  further  investigation.  However  when  challenged,  the
animals retained  the  physiological  ability  to  compete  in  aggres-
sive encounters.  From  an  ecological  perspective,  both  bulk  and
nano TiO 2-exposed  ﬁsh  can  maintain  routine  swimming  speeds
for
 activities  like  foraging  behaviours,  as  well  as  defend  them-
selves from  aggressors.  However,  bursts  of  high  speed  swimming
may  be problematic for the TiO 2-NP  exposed  ﬁsh  in  particu-
lar.
