Swimming PoolInjuries,

ABRASIVE accidents inswimming pools are
.tvnot rare.Theymayoccurindiving, in
gettinginoroutofthepool,orinunderwater
swimming. Mostfrequently suchaccidents in-
volvethebridgeofthenose,theelbows, orthe
knees.Although inthemselves theyareseldom
ofconsequence, ithasrecently beenrecognized
thatthistypeofaccident mayleadtoinocula-
tionlupusvulgaris, granulomatous tuberculosis
lesions, orothertuberculosis-like lesions.
Mycobacterium tuberculosis
Hellerstrom (1),in1951,reviewed sixcases
ofinoculation lupusvulgaris, someofwhichhe
hadreported asearlyas1939(2).Theywereall
associated withswimming-pool injuries. De-
scribing theclinicalfeatures, which werestrik-
inglyuniform, hewrote:
Within anareaofacoupleofsquarecentimeters
ormore onthebridgeofthenoseaneruption de-
veloped, whichconsisted ofsoftpapules, reddish-
violettoreddish-brown incolor,andranging insize
fromapinhead toasplitpea;someofthepapules
weretoppedbycrustsandcoalesced. Twoofthe
casespresented elevated ulcersmeasuring 15by15
and7by7millimeters, respectively. Inthemajor
proportion ofcasestheinitialabrasion hadhealed
whenthepapulesappeared inthevicinity. Ondia-
scopicexamination thepapulesshowedthedistinc-
tivecoloroflupusnodules, andtheywereeasily
penetrated byabluntprobeapplied withslight
pressure. Hence,theclinicaldiagnosis waslupus
vulgaris. Theregionallymphnodes wereeithernot
atall,oronlyslightly tomoderately, enlarged.
InonecaseHellerstrom observed acid-fast
bacilliinthelesions,thusaffording somelabo-
ratoryconfirmation tohisdiagnosis.
LaterHellerstrom (3),using moresensitive
laboratory techniques, wasabletoisolatethe
tubercle bacillus from oneswimming pool.Hefeltthattheproblem ofskintuberculosis ac-
quiredinswimming poolswascomplex andfar
frombeingsolved. Hesuggested that,al-
thoughtuberculosis controlofficersandsanitary
engineers haveaninterest, "tuberculosis asa
waterborne infection isaproblem thatcallsfor
theattention ofdermatologists ..
Alsoin1951,Cleveland (4)reported four
casesfromCanada. Heconcluded that"the
clinicalandhistopathologic appearance ofthe
lesionswasstrongly suggestive oftuberculosis
cutis"although "noacid-fast bacilliwere
demonstrated inthelesions..."AllCleve-
land'scaseswereassociated withthesame
swimming pool,whichwasfilledwithtidalsea
waterandwasundergoodsanitary control.
Hebelieved thatthepoolcontamination might
haveresulted fromthedischarge ofurineor
sputumfromaninfected person. Insummary,
Cleveland suggested that"tuberculous infection
mayoccurmoreoftenthantheabsenceofre-
portedcaseswouldindicate."
Incommenting onthesepapers,Sulzberger
andBaer(5a)suggested thattheetiology was
questionable. Theypointed outthatthe
smegma bacillus maybepresent inpoolsin
largenumbers andalsothatthisorganism when
inoculated intotheskinproduced a"tuberculoid
typeofresponse."
Mycobacterium balnei
Inacomprehensive monograph, Linelland
Norden (6)summarized previous studiesand
described anepidemic of80casesofbenignskin
ulceration inOrebro,Sweden. Theyisolateda
previously unknown Mycobacterium verysimi-
lartoKoch'sbacillus andgaveitthespecific
namebalnei.
LinellandNorden's caseswerecharacterized
byapapularlesionofspongyconsistency which

ganismwasisolated fromboththewaterand

conclusively thatM.balneiwastheetiological

term"mycobacteriosis balnearea" wasapplied
tothesyndrome. Whenbreakpoint chlorina-
tionwasintroduced, theepidemic wasbrought
completely undercontrol.
OtherReported Cases
Briick(7),in1951,described 3casesofinocu-
lationtuberculosis, 2ofwhichwereassociated
withswimming poolinjuries. In1952,here-
portedanother caseofinoculation lupus(8).
Isolation ofthetubercle bacillus fromthe
lesionscompletely confirmed theclinicaldiag-
nosis.Thesefindings ledBriicktoconclude that
"so-called swimmer's lupus," ormycobacteri-
osisbalnearea,could beseparated intotwotypes:
(a)casesinwhichM.tuberclosis wasthecaus-
ativeagent,and(b)casesinwhichM.balnei
wasresponsible fortheinfection. Heplaced
his1952caseandthoseofHellerstr6m inthe
firstcategory, andthecasesofLinellandNor-
denandZettergren inthesecond.Hellerstrom,
inapaperalreadycited(3),reviewed allofthe
available casehistories andconcluded with
Briickthatsimilarclinicalmanifestations may

States,reported anotlher caseofinoculation
lupusvulgaris, whichwascharacterized asskin
granuloma withtubercle formation ofunknown
etiology. Thisinfection resulted fromanose
abrasion inaswimming-pool accident.
Ninecasesofpost-swimming-pool abrasion

inSaniFrancisco. Theclinicalpicturewasquite
different fromthatgivenbyHellerstr6m. As
totheetiology, ReesandBennett ruledout

infections, buttheywereunablepositively to
definetheagent.Theymentioned thepossi-
bilityofinfection bythesmegmabacillusorby
21.tuberculosis, although neitherwasdemon-
stratedinthelesionsorthepool.
Inthe1954-1955 YearBookofDermatology
andSyphilology (5b),Sulzberger andBaerre-
viewedthemonograph byLinellandNordlen
andcommented asfollows: "Thisisamasterly
clarificationi ofarelatively newentityappar-
entlycausedbyaquitenewlydiscovered acid-
fastmycobacterium [211.balnei]. Itappears
virtually certainthatthisistheentitypre-
viouslydescribed byHellerstrom inSweden,

Conclusion
Itisclearfromtheforegoing reviewthata
newdiseaseentity-a lupuslike dermatitis-and
possibly anewmeansoftransmitting skintuber-
culosisarenowknown. Whatisnotknownis
howwidespread orfrequent theinfections are.
ThefindingofcasesinEurope,Canada, andthe
UnitedStateswouldindicatewidespread geo-
graphic distribution. Thoseconcerned with
theoperation ofswimming poolsshouldbe
awareofthepotential hazardfromthissource,
andtheclinician shouldconsider swimming-
pooltraumainthediagnosis oftuberculosis-like
skininfections.
Fromthelimited dataavailable, itwould
