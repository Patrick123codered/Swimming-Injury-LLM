Shoulder injuries are common in athletes. In baseball, for 
example, 12% to 19% of injuries are located at the shoulder,
42 whereas in swimming, shoulder injuries are 
estimated to be between 23% and 38% within a single year.8,52Overhead athletes often perform shoulder movements with 
high velocity and extreme range of motion, thus making them more likely to suffer from shoulder issues. Modifications can be found in these athletes’ shoulders not only after several years of 931764 SPHXXX10.1177/1941738120931764T ooth et alPORTS HEALTH

Risk Factors of Overuse Shoulder  
Injuries in Overhead Athletes:  
A Systematic Review

Context: Shoulder injuries are highly prevalent in sports involving the upper extremity. Some risk factors have been identified in the literature, but consensus is still lacking.
Objectives: To identify risk factors of overuse shoulder injury in overhead athletes, as described in the literature.Data Sources: A systematic review of the literature from the years 1970 to 2018 was performed using 2 electronic 
databases: PubMed and Scopus.
Study Selection: Prospective studies, written in English, that described at least 1 risk factor associated with overuse 
shoulder injuries in overhead sports (volleyball, handball, basketball, swimming, water polo, badminton, baseball, and tennis) were considered for analysis.
Study Design: Systematic review.Level of Evidence: Level 3.Data Extraction: Data were extracted from 25 studies. Study methodology quality was evaluated using the Modified 
Coleman Methodology Score.
Results: Intrinsic factors, previous injury, range of motion (lack or excess), and rotator cuff weakness (isometric and 
isokinetic) highly increase the risk of future injuries. Additionally, years of athletic practice, body mass index, sex, age, and level of play seem to have modest influence. As for the effect of scapular dysfunction on shoulder injuries, it is still controversial, though these are typically linked. Extrinsic factors, field position, condition of practice (match/training), time of season, and training load also have influence on the occurrence of shoulder injuries.
Conclusion: Range of motion, rotator cuff muscle weakness, and training load are important modifiable factors associated 
with shoulder injuries. Scapular dysfunction may also have influence. The preventive approach for shoulder injury should focus on these factors.

479practice but also after a single season.49 Some authors have 
measured an increase in external rotation as well as a decrease 
in internal rotation and in total range of motion in overhead athletes.
48,49 These changes tend to be prolonged in time3,28,54 
and could be associated with an increase in humeral head retroversion.
7,56 Shoulder strength is also modified because of 
practice. Additionally, a decrease in the external rotators/internal rotators ratio is observed in overhead athletes.
14,19,24,38 
Scapular dyskinesis has been widely explored during the past few years because of its high prevalence among overhead athletes (61%) versus among nonoverhead athletes (33%).
4 The 
evidence has shown a lack of scapular upward rotation in baseball pitchers
27 as well as an increase in scapular anterior 
tilting in swimmers.22
Nowadays, clinicians are looking for prevention strategies to 
decrease injuries and time loss, resulting in enhanced performance.
15 Prior to implementing a preventative program 
for athletes, the first step is to identify the various risk factors associated with the sport in question. Without this approach, quality work cannot be achieved.
At present, few systematic reviews have evaluated risk factors 
for shoulder pain or shoulder injuries in overhead sports. Webster et al
54 focused primarily on water polo, while 
Challoumas et al6 focused on volleyball; however, their sample 
sizes were too limited to draw any conclusions.
Therefore, the objective of this systematic review is to 
highlight risk factors for shoulder injuries in athletes practicing overhead sports with regard to other nonrelated sports.
Methods
The PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) checklist was used to gauge the quality of this systematic review.
Research Strategy
A search was performed at the beginning of October 2017 on the PubMed and Scopus databases. A combination of keywords and Medical Subject Headings terms was used, as shown in the Appendix (available in the online version of this article). Additional studies were found using the references of articles and were added to the database if they met the inclusion criteria. The study search was again performed in October 2018 to include articles published in 2018.
Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
Articles included in the study needed to describe at least 1 possible risk factor associated with shoulder injuries in overhead sports. Only prospective studies were included, as that study design is the most efficient way to identify risk factors in a population.
28 Athletes assessed in the retained studies needed to 
practice 1 of the following sports: volleyball, handball, basketball, swimming, water polo, baseball, badminton, or tennis.
Moreover, articles meeting at least 1 of the following criteria 
were excluded from the study: (1) experimenting on animals, (2) not written in English, (3) not available in full text, (4) assessing a region other than the shoulder complex, (5) concerning traumatic or contact injuries, (6) not including patient examination, (7) including Paralympic athletes, and (8) concerning surgical procedures or outcomes.
Study Selection
Two investigators independently selected the articles based on title and abstract, in accordance with the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Investigators were not blinded to author names and affiliations or journal names. If there was disagreement between the 2 investigators, a third was consulted to find consensus. The full text of the selected articles was independently read by the 2 investigators to identify risk factors described in the articles, and only relevant articles were kept for analysis.
Data Extraction and Quality Assessment
The following data were extracted from the articles by the 2 investigators: author names, year of publication, country, number of participants, sex and age of participants, randomization, blinding method, incidence of shoulder injury, risk factors examined, risk factors identified, assessment method, outcome measures, length of tracking, definition of shoulder pain or shoulder injury, level of play, field position, percentage of participants who completed the study, and risk ratios (Table 1).
The quality of the articles was assessed by each author 
independently using the Modified Coleman Methodology Score (MCMS), adapted from Cowan et al
13 and previously used and 
described by Burn et al4 in 2016. The last 5 items were excluded 
from the analysis because no data on treatment were provided in the included studies. Group comparability was also not considered for the analysis as it was not appropriated with prospective studies. A total score was calculated for each article by summing the different individual scores, with a maximum total of 64 points. Degree of agreement between investigators in the quality assessment was estimated using 2 statistical tests: a Student t test for absolute reproducibility and an intraclass correlation test (2-way mixed, single measures, absolute agreement) for relative reproducibility.
Results
Literature Search
The search strategy identified 1214 potentially relevant  
articles on PubMed and 2059 on Scopus, amounting to a total of 3273 articles. After title and abstract review, only 198 articles were retained and fully read. After screening the 198 articles, 180 were excluded from analysis. Seven other studies that met the inclusion criteria were added to the database based on references of other articles or systematic reviews. Finally, 25 articles were considered relevant and retained for analysis. This search strategy is outlined in Figure 1.

484Data Extraction and Quality Assessment
The studies in this systematic review included participants from 
6 different sports: baseball (n = 11), handball (n = 6), swimming (n = 3), volleyball (n = 2), tennis (n = 1), and basketball (n = 1). Additionally, 1 study included recreational overhead athletes without distinction between sports. Participant age ranged between 7 and 36.6 years. A total of 17 studies included male athletes, 7 included both male and female athletes, and 1 included only female athletes. The duration of follow-up was quite variable, ranging from 31 weeks to 10 years, with a mean (±SD) follow-up period of 2.23 ± 2.4 years. The standard deviation is larger than the mean, which shows an important interstudy variability in the length of follow-up.
The level of evidence of the included articles was between 1 
and 3, but it was not specified in 10 articles. The quality score of the articles was calculated as the average of the scores from the 2 investigators. Statistical analysis showed a very good interrater agreement both for t  test (P  = 0.752) and for intraclass correlation 
coefficient (0.981; range, 0.958-0.992). The scores varied between 21 and 43 of a total of 64, with a mean score of 30.4 ±  6.00. The score assigned to each article can be found in Table 1. The score provided is the mean score from the 2 investigators.
Risk Factors for Shoulder Injuries
The different risk factors of shoulder injuries identified in the studies are summarized in Table 2 (intrinsic factors) and Table 3 (extrinsic factors).
discussion
The purpose of this systematic review is to identify risk factors of overuse shoulder injury in overhead athletes. Despite the important variability of the quality of the studies, several intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors have been highlighted among the 25 studies retained. All of these factors should be considered in managing overhead athletes, and the modifiable ones may be the subject of preventative strategies.

486demonstrated that, in baseball, a side-to-side difference of 13° 
still increased the risk of shoulder injuries by a factor of 6. The sleeper stretch can be performed regularly by athletes with glenohumeral internal rotation deficit to loosen the shoulder joint.
11,12 Moreover, an excess of external rotation range of 
motion, which can increase anteroinferior instability,51 could be 
modified by proprioception and motor control exercises.39
Even if causes of scapular dysfunction are quite disparate, 
Kibler26 recommend 2 different types of alterations: a lack of 
extensibility and an altered motor pattern. Pectoralis minor stretching could be done in association with TheraBand exercises to normalize scapular motor pattern.
25,31
As demonstrated in this review, there should be a focus on 
strengthening the external (concentric and eccentric modes) and internal (eccentric mode only) rotators to provide stability to the humeral head during movement of the upper extremity in overhead athletes. Athletic equipment such as elastic bands and dumbbells can be used, even if the gold standard remains the isokinetic dynamometer, which can instantly adapt the resistance to the individual strength of the athlete.
The importance of optimal management of the training load 
must be emphasized. The frequency of sports matches and the intensity of training have an important influence on shoulder issues, thereby amplifying strain injuries caused by inadequate movement and lack of recovery time.
16,29,32 Coaches and trainers 
should be aware of the importance of quantifying training load and adapt it to each athlete.
This systematic review has several limitations. The first is the 
variability of the different studies included in this review. The level of evidence varied between 1 and 3 for each study. Moreover, the MCMS scores of the included articles are between 21 and 43 out of a total of 64. It is clear that there are differences between articles regarding methodology and quality. Additionally, the populations that were examined varied in age, number of athletes included, sport practiced, hours of training, level of play, and history, which may influence the results. Finally, the length of study varied, with athletes examined between a 0- and 10-year time span.
conclusion
This systematic review highlights important risk factors for shoulder injuries in overhead athletes. Prevention is an existing topic, but the small numbers of prospective studies published on that topic in the literature and the important variability of the quality of the studies included in this systematic review show that risk factors of shoulder injuries in overhead sports are still not completely demonstrated. Biomechanics differs from one sport to another. Although there are 11 studies on baseball, there are other sports such as volleyball, tennis, and badminton that beg to be explored if prevention is to be mastered. The true efficiency of prevention programs to limit shoulder injuries in overhead athletes must also be further investigated.
