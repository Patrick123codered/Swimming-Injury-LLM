Abstract  
The results of the c ompetitive swimming in Hong Kong 
have been raised in the past years. Many Hong Kong Records  
have been broken by the Hong Kong swimmers in international 
events. In order to achieve outstanding results, swimmers 
in Hong Kong received intense training and soon after years, 
it is common to hear swimmers got injured due to 
overtraining. The purpose o f this study is to investigate 
the injury patterns of swimming injuries of swimmers whom 
were studied in schools that participated in the Hong Kong 
Inter-school Swimming Championships (Hong Kong  Island and 
Kowloon) Division I 2010/2011 and 2011/2012.  
There were 437 young swimmers participated in the study. 
There result showed that 154 swimmers (59 males and 95 
females) had suffered from injuries in the past one year. 
There were a total of 437 injury incidents happened in the 
past one year among all the swi mmers and gave an incidence 
rate of 0.28 per 1000 training hours. Swimmers from the 
junior training squad had the highest incidence rate. 
Sprain/strain at lumbar spine/low back (27  cases) and 
strain at shoulder (26  cases) were the most frequent sites 
at upper extremities and dorsal trunk while in the lower 
7 
extremities, muscle cramps at the thigh/lower legs (53  
cases) and sprain at ankle (46  cases) were the most common 
injuries.  The demographical information of swimmers with 
shoulder injuries was also invest igated.

Chapter One  
Introduction  
Swimming is one of the elite sports in Hong Kong. This 
is because the Hong Kong team has gained outstanding 
results in numerous  international events, especially in the 
2009 East Asian Games and the 2010 Asian Games. For years, 
the Hong Kong swimmers have broken  the new Hong Kong 
records in different competitions : in 2010, the Hong Kong 
swimmers have broken 3 new Hong Kong records in Asian 
Games-Guangzhou, China and 7 new Hong Kong records in 10th 
FINA World Swimming Championships - Dubai, UAE ( Chiu, 2011) . 
These tell us that their limits have not bee n reached. 
There are still  rooms of improvement can be made and Hong 
Kong swimmers are stepping toward the bright stage of the 
swimming world.  
In the pas t, swimming is a survival or rescue skill. 
People swim for bathing, cooling, fishing, recreation, 
exercise and sport. The modern four swimming styles are 
developed throughout years. Front crawl as an example, it 
is deduced from the dog paddle, to breastst roke, sidestroke, 
then trudgen  (Colwin, 2002). Other than the front crawl, 
14 
the mechanism of breathing technique,as an example, among  
the backstroke, breaststroke and butterfly are also changed 
to the nowadays forms.  
Every year, there are 12 boys’ schools an d 12 girls’ 
schools participate in the Inter -school Swimming 
Championships (Hong Kong Island & Kowloon) Division I. New 
records are always created by young swimmers within this 
division rather than division two or three. Thus, it is 
believed that the train ing quantity is much tenser within 
this group of swimmers. Since th ere are a significant 
number of swimmers (either for recreational or competitive) 
in Hong Kong, it is essential to understand the pattern of 
the potential injuries so as to set up preventiv e measures 
to prevent and reduce the chance of the swimming injuries 
to occur.  
 
Statement of the Problem 
The aim of the study was to investigate the injury 
patterns of Inter-school Swimming Championships (Hong Kong 
Island & Kowloon) Division I swimmers  in Hong Kong. 
Included in the study was an attempt to identify the injury 
15 
patterns and the demography information of the shoulder 
injuries of swimmers in Hong Kong.   
 
Purpose of the Study  
The purpose of the study was to investigate the injury 
patterns among s wimmers in Hong Kong Inter-school Swimming 
Championships (Hong Kong Island & Kowloon) Division I and 
would be providing information for coaches and swimmers  of 
common injuries in swimming. This would help the coaches 
and schools to develop a better plan for training so as to 
reduce the risk of injury and improve their training 
quality. Also, it can raise the awareness of sports 
injuries among recreational swimmers.  To understand the 
injury patterns of swimmers, the following research 
questions were asked:  
1. What would t he injury patterns of swimmers in Inter -
school Swimming Championships (Hong Kong Island & 
Kowloon) Division I  be?  
2. Are there any association  between the performance 
levels of swimmers and their injury patterns ? 
16 
3. Are there any association  between the main st roke of 
swimmers and their injury patterns ? 
4. Are there any association between training intensity  
of swimmers and the injury patterns?  
5. Are there any association between different main 
strokes of swimmers and the shoulder injury patterns?  
 
Definition of Te rms 
The operational definitions of the terms in this study 
were defined as follows:  
Sport Injuries 
It refers to any injuries that happen ed when playing 
sports or exercising. Some are from accidents. Others can 
result from poor training practices or imprope r gear. Some 
people get injured when they are not in proper condition. 
Not warming up or stretching enough before playing or 
exercising can also lead to injuries  (U.S. Department of 
Health and Human Services, 2009) . 
17 
Performance Level 
It refers to the highe st swimming ability of the 
subjects including Hong Kong Team, Regional  Training Squad, 
Junior Training Squad, swimming clubs swimmers and school 
team only swimmers.   
Swimming Strokes 
There are four swimming stroke s as stated in the FINA 
(Federation Intern ational De Association). They are 
freestyle, backstroke, breaststroke and butterfly.  
Freestyle  
It means that in an event so designated  the swimmer 
may swim any style and s ome part of the swimmer must break 
the surface of the water throughout the race  except that in 
individual medley or medley relay events, freestyle means 
any style other than backstroke, breaststroke or butterfly  
(FINA, SW 5 Freestyle, 2010) . 
Backstroke   
Prior to the starting signal, the swimmers shall line 
up in the water facing the starti ng end, with both hands 
holding the starting grips.  The swimmer shall push off and 
18 
swim upon his back throughout the race except when 
executing a turn  (FINA, SW 6 Backstroke, 2010) . 
Breaststroke  
From the beginning of the first arm stroke after the 
start an d after each turn, the body shall be on the breast. 
It is not permitted to roll onto the back at any time. From 
the start and throughout the race , the stroke cycle must be 
one arm stroke and one leg kick in that order. All 
movements of the arms shall be si multaneous and on the same 
horizontal plane without alternating movement  (FINA, SW 7 
Breaststroke, 2010) . 
Butterfly  
Both arms shall be brought forward together over the 
water and brought backward simultaneously through -out the 
race. All up and down movemen ts of the legs must be 
simultaneous. The legs or the feet need not be on the same 
level, but they shall not alternate in relation to each 
other. A breaststroke kicking movement is not permitted  
(FINA, SW 8 Butterfly, 2010) . 
 
19 
Individual Medley  
  Swimmer cov ers the four swimming strokes in the 
following order: Butterfly, Backstroke, Breaststroke and 
Freestyle. Each of the strokes must cover one quarter (1/4) 
of the distance (FINA, SW 9 Medley Swimming, 2010) . 
Additional Land Training 
It refers to the any type s of extra training on dry-
land which aims to enhance the muscular strength and 
endurance of swimmers so as to improve their performance.  
Warm Up 
It refers to the exercise conducted prior to 
performance, whether or not muscle or body temperature is 
elevated (Powers & Howley, 2004) .  
Cool Down 
It refers to activities including slow walking and 
stretching exercises that gradually return heart rate and 
blood pressure back to normal(Powers & Howley, 2004) .  
20 
Delimitations  
The delimitations of the present study w ere list as 
follows:   
1. The subjects were  delimited to  be the school swimming 
team members  whom schools had participated 
consecutively in the Inter -school Swimming 
Championships (Hong Kong Island & Kowloon) Division 
One for the academic year s of 2010/2011 and 2011/2012.  
2. The subjects were assumed to have regular swimming or 
dry-land training  at least once per week. 
3. Incidence of injuries was delimited to the past one 
year. 
 
Limitations  
The following limitations should be considered when 
interpreting the results of this study:   
1. It was assumed that the injury items of the 
questionnaire are enough to measure the common types 
of injury.  
2. It was assumed that all subjects would answer the 
questionnaires honestly.  
21 
3. It was assumed that all subjects were able to identify 
their injuries.  
 
Significance of the Study  
The significance of study was to investigate the 
potential injuries  in swimming . It exa mined associations 
between gender, age, performance level s, the main stroke s 
and the years of participation in the Championships  of the 
swimmers with the injuries. It also provide d information to 
compare the injury pattern s from the Hong Kong team 
swimmers to the school team  swimmers.  
The study was specifically focused on the injuries 
that are related to the shoulder . According to the  
Federation In ternationale de Natation (FINA ) (Mountjoy et 
al, 2010), it was reported that in the World Championships 
2009, the up per extremity especially shoulder was the most 
frequently injured region. Finding out the pattern s of 
injuries c ould help the coach es and schools  to plan and 
develop their training programs so as to enhance swimmers’ 
performance and improve their skills and tech nique 
effectively.  
22 
Chapter Two  
Review o f Literature  
It is likely to have injuries when you play basketball, 
rugby, and soccer. It is always heard that people who are 
injured shall swim for rehabilitation but it is rare to get 
injured because of swimming.  
The rate of swimming injuries and  the rate of sho ulder 
dislocation in sports  will be included  in this chapter . 
 
Rate of Swimming Injuries 
Some researchers had conducted a study about the injury 
patterns in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA)  
Division I -A level (Wolf, Ebinger,  Lawler & Britton, 2009). 
They followed one men and women swimming team over 5 
seasons (2002 -2007). Out of 44 male and 50 female athletes, 
90 injuries were sustained by 32 males (72.7%) and 35 
female swimmers g ot 76 injuri es (70.0%).  There was no 
significant gender different in the risk of being injured. 
The common injuries in cluded in the  report were 
shoulder/upper arm (23 cases out of 55 swimmers), neck/back 
23 
(12 cases out of 38 swimmers) and elbow/wrist/hand/finger 
(6 out of 18 male swimmers) or knee/leg (5 cases out of 13 
female swimmers). In the study, there were 30% and 28% of 
male and female swimmers injury cases reported in their 
strength training that back/neck injury happened the most . 
Moreover, there was no relationship  between the injury to 
different body part s and the stroke specialty.  
Although Wolf et al. (2009) indicated  that there was no 
correlation between the body part injured and the stroke 
specialty , Grote, Lincoln & Gamble  (2004) pointed out that 
breaststroke swi mmers had a greater chance to have groin 
pain (6.92%) than the individual medley swimmers who did 
not take part in the breaststroke events ( 0, P = 0.015). 
From the survey collected from th e 296 competitive swimmers, 
it was found that the pain at hip adduct ors (groin injury) 
has been affecting or inhibiting the trainings and 
competitions of these breaststroke swimmers.  
Furthermore, 341 elite swimmers conditions were followed 
by Knobloch , Yoon, Kraemer & Vogt (2008). It is found that 
the overall injury rate o f these swimmers was 0.39/1000h. 
In details, the rate of overuse injuries  was greater than 
the acute injuries (0.22/1000h and 0.17/1000h respectively).  
24 
It is likely to see th at the injuries of upper limbs was 
much more than the trunk or lower limbs (0.11,  0.067 and 
0.085 per 1000h correspondingly) while ahead by the knee 
pain at the rate of 0.17/1000h. The study also made 
contrast with the previous research of Wolf et al. (2009) 
that 200 -400m breaststroke swimmers had a higher risk of 
knee pain (relative ri sk, RR 5.1, p = 0.001). Shoulder 
overuse syndromes and acute shoulder injury were indicated 
as in freestyle and butterfly swimmers respectively. It was 
noted that athletes who trained for 4 times a week or above 
were under a higher risk of knee injuries (R R2.1) and 
shoulder injuries (RR4.0).  
On the other hand, a case study  was reported that a 
female butterfly swimmer  suffered from the bilateral 
subluxation of sternoclavicular joints which initially  
associated with pain and discomfort at the shoulder girdle  
(Echlin & Michaelson , 2006).  Another case of swimming 
injury was that a 31-year-old male recreational  triathlete 
reported that he ha d headaches and temporomandibular joint  
pain while attempting to incorporate bilateral breathing 
into his free -style swimmi ng training regime  (Yuill & Howit, 
2009). Besides, an unusual case of injury that happened to 
25 
competitive swimmer s was the chronic costochondritis. In 
this case, a 14 years old female competitive swimmer 
reported that the pain occurred during dry -land train ing, 
including push -ups, seated rows, medicine ball toss and 
relieved with rest. Due to the numerous consecutive push -
ups performance during swimming practice, the pain was the n 
developed  (Cubos, Cubos & Stefano,2010) .   
 
Rate of Shoulder Dislocation in  Sports 
There were many kinds of injuries over the shoulder 
complex, including the sternoclavicular  joint injury, 
clavicle fracture, acrominoclavicular joint injury, 
osteolysis of the distal clavicle, little league shoulder, 
proximal humerus fracture, gleno humeral instability and 
rotator cuff injury. The level of injury and the patterns 
were related to the kind s of sport, the intensity involved 
and the level of participation  (Kocher, Waters & Micheli, 
2000). 
When the arm was forcefully abducted (e.g. when making  an 
arm tackle in football) or having an excessive shoulder 
external rotation and extension, i.e., arm in the overhead 
26 
position (Anderson, Hall  & Martin,  2000). A study of 
“Injuries to the Shoulder in the Throwing Athlete” by  Keith 
Meister (2000) g ave a clear explanation of ho w the throwing 
mechanism affect ed the shoulder complex. It is mentioned 
that the improper mechanics and poor conditioning 
contribute to the injuries of throwing shoulder the most. 
Meister (2000) had t he following elaboration about  part of 
the throwing phase  that may lead to injury :  
Hyperextension of the knee while planting the striding 
leg and landing on the heel cause a sudden deceleration of 
the body, which results in undue counterforce on the 
throwing arm. Such a maneuver is often s een in pitcher s who 
are “overthrowing”  and trying to get more velocity on their 
fastballs.  
The planted foot should always point toward home plate. 
Placing the striding foot outside the target (toward the 
first-base side for a right -handed pitcher) and wide  to the 
torso results in “opening up too soon”.  In this instance, 
pelvic rotation occurs too early, creating increased stress 
across the anterior shoulder and elbow. Planting the foot 
toward the third -base side of home plate slows down 
27 
rotation of the tors o, taking from the body’s momentum and 
forcing the throw to be delivered entirely by the arm.  
The throwing motion should be a smooth acceleration and 
deceleration of the cente r of gravity toward the target . 
(p.269)  
The excessive stress on the upper arm wo uld then give 
impact on the structure of the shoulder girdle.  
A survey on the shoulder injury pa tterns of high school 
athletes was conducted in 2005 -2006 and 2006 -2007 school 
years (Bonza, Fields  & Yard, 2009). A total of nine sports 
were inves tigated. Th ey were: football, soccer, basketball, 
baseball, and wrestling for boys and soccer, volleyball, 
basketball, and softball for girls. In the result, 805 
shoulder injuries were reported out of 3,550,141 athlete -
exposures (AEs). It is more likely to have shoul der 
injuries occur during competition than practice (rate ratio 
= 3.01, 95% confidence interval = 2.62, 3.46). Nevertheless, 
Thomas and Swanik  (2009) measured glenohumeral internal 
rotation (IR) and external rotation (ER) with the scapular 
stabilized of 10  swimmers, 16 tennis players and 10 tennis 
players. All of them were female athletes. Results showed 
that the internal rotation decreased from preseason to 
28 
postseason (P=.012) and swimmers had less IR than both 
volleyball and tennis players (P = .001). Ext ernal rotation 
also decreased in the swimmers (P= .001). In the overall, 
from the preseason to postseason, the total motion 
decreased for athletes participating in swimming ( P =.001) 
and tennis (P = .019). It is then suggested that close 
monitoring should be given to the athletes throughout the 
competitive seasons.  
In swimming, during the hand entry and exit of the 
freestyle stroke (most swimmers would choose front crawl),  
the following muscular co -ordinations were involved to 
perform the motion: the upper trapezius, rhomboids, 
supraspinatus, middle deltoid and anterior deltoid position 
the scapula and the humerus. The serratus anterior and 
subscapularis also performed to position the scapular and 
the internal rotation of the humerus respectively  (Pink & 
Tibone, 2000) .  
Similar study on the measurement on the glenohumeral 
internal and external rotation was also conducted on 54 
healthy males  (Torres & Gomes,  2009). Subjects wer e divided 
into 3 groups (tennis players, swimmers, control group). 
From the result, the mean glenohumeral internal rotation 
29 
deficit (GIRD) in tennis players, swimmers and control 
group were 23.9° ± 8.4° ( P <.001), 12° ± 6.8° ( P <.001) and 
4.9° ± 7.4° ( P =.035)  respectively. It showed that 
significant difference of dominant shoulder  between all 
groups, and the difference in internal rotation of the 
dominant shoulder between the group of tennis players in 
comparison with the control group (27.6°, P < .001) was 
greater than the difference in internal rotation of the 
dominant shoulder foun d in the group of swimmers compared 
with the control group (17.9°, P <.001). Between tennis 
players and swimmers, the difference in internal rotation 
of the dominant shoulder was 9.7° ( P =.002). 
A research had been done on the bony defect of the 
glenoid rim  (Saito et al., 2005). The hypo thesis was that 
the bony defect was anterior rather than anteroinferior to 
the glenoid and the result confirmed this that the mean 
orientation of the defect was pointing toward 3:01 on the 
clock face of the glenoid, at a mean angle of 9 0.5° ± 10.4° 
from the 12 -o’clock direction.  
A study on the injury in rugby (Headey, Brooks  & Kemp, 
2007) had the following findings: The most common match 
injury was acromioclavicular joint injury (32%); the most 
30 
severe was shoulder dislocation and instab ility (mean 
severity, 81 days absent), which also caused the greatest 
proportion of absence (42%) and had the highest rate of 
recurrence (62%). The majority of match shoulder injuries 
were sustained in the tackl e (65%), and outside backs were 
the most likel y to sustain an injury from tackling 
(2.4/1000 player -tackles). It is then suggested that: the 
potential to reduce this injury burden by modifying 
training activities and implementing “prehabilitation” 
strategies in an effort to minimize the risk of should er 
dislocation/instability.  
Summary 
 In summary, differ from other sports, swimming 
requires  relatively  more strength and power of the upper 
limbs and trunk and the coordinations  between the breathing 
and stroke motions is also a necessity .  
 Common injured body sites in swimming include the 
shoulder region, spine and knee.  Proper treatment should be 
taken and consultation s from professional are encouraged  in 
returning to trainings and participating  in competitions.

Method 
The method of this study was presented in the 
following sections: 1) The subjects, 2) Instruments, 3) 
Procedures and 4) Method of analysis.  
 
The Subjects  
The subjects were both male and female swimmers. Th ey 
were from the school swimming team s whom schools had been  
consecutively participated in the Inter -school Swimming 
Championships Division I in the academic year s of 2010/2011 
and 2011/2012.  A total of 19 secondary schools fulfill ed 
this requirement  while only 15 schools participated in the 
study with 8 girls’ schools and 7 boys’ schools . The total 
number of subjects was 437 with 266 (60.9%) girls and 171 
(39.1%) boys, aged 13 to 19 . 
The performance level include d Hong Kong team swimmers 
(4.1%), regional training squads (5.5%), junior training 
squads (2.3%), swimming clubs swimmers (67.7%) and swimmers 
who only train in school swimming team (19.9%).  
32 
Instrument  
A self-designed questionnaire was used as the method 
of collecting data  (see Appendix B). The procedures for 
developing the self -designed q uestionnaires are based on 
reviewing the journals that were related to the research 
topic. The development of the questionnaire and translation 
were supervised by the advisor. The questionnaire was 
divided into t hree parts. 
In the first part, the demograph ic information of the 
respondents such as gender, performance level, stroke 
majored in, training hours on swimming a nd fitness , warm up 
and cool down exercise habit s were investigated. The y were 
not required to provide thei r names.   
In the second part, it focused on injuries happened 
within one year time. Common injuries in swimming were 
investigated, sorted by inju ry sites with type s of injuries . 
Other injuries out of the list would also be asked to 
specify by the subject s. 
In the third part, only subject s who had been suffered 
in shoulder injuries were required to answer.  The 
background information such as the dominate side and 
injured side, the period of suffering in the injury (acut e 
33 
or chronic),  the occasion  when injury happen ed, the motion 
that caused the injur y, the time for recovery , medical help 
from hospitals  and a self rating on the muscle strength , 
rang of motion and swimming skills have also been asked.  
 
Procedures  
A pilot test was conducted with the swimmers from Hong 
Kong Baptist University swimming team and Hill Top Swimming 
Club to assess the suitability of the questionnaire before 
the formal survey.  
The purposes of this conduction were to see whether 
the Chinese transla tion matches the English terms and to 
test if the wordings used were understandable and 
acceptable. In this pilot study, 40 swimmers were asked to 
complete the questionnaire and stated out the problem s of 
understanding the questions after completing the 
questionnaires.   
In the actual study, questionnaires were ad ministered 
to subjects by school teachers and swimming team captains. 
The purpose of the study has been explained to the subject s 
by the administrator. The respondents were asked to recall 
34 
their past experience in swimming in t he past years and 
also within the past one year. Each questionnaire took 
approximately 3 minutes to complete.  
 
Method of Analysis  
All the responses of the questionnaires will be coded 
for further data analysis and inputted into Statistic 
Package of Social Science 16.0 for windows” (SPSS 16.0) and 
Microsoft Excel. All statistical procedures were tested at 
the 0.05 level of significance. Descriptive statistics such 
as frequency, mean, standard deviation and percentage will 
be used to describe the social demog raphic information such 
as the personal data, exercise and warm up habit, the main 
stroke and injury patterns of the subjects.  
In comparing the means difference between male and 
female swimmers in hours of swimming, additional fitness 
training a nd the main stroke, the independent group t -test 
and One way ANOVA were used.

The D1 swimmers were categorized into five performance 
levels. As illu strated in Table 2, the rate s of injury of 
the Hong Kong team (8 swimmers), Regional training squad 
(10 swimmers), the junior training squad (3 swimmers) and 
those who only trained in the school swimming teams (21 
swimmers) were 1.8%, 2.3%, 0.7% and 4.8% re spectively. For 
those who trained in the swimming clubs (112 swimmers), the 
injury rate was relatively much higher than the rest of the 
performance groups which was 25.6%.  
Table 3 showed that there was no significant difference 
between the performance lev els and the injury occurrence 
(p<0.05).

The main stroke of the subjects was identified. The 
front crawl was the main stroke of 147 swimmers (33.6%) 
while 112 sw immers (25.7%) chose breaststroke as their main 
stroke. Backstroke and butterfly were the main strokes of 
86 (19.7%) and 63 (14.4%) swimmers. The individual medley 
had the fewest swimmers with 29 out of 437 (6.6%) swimmers. 
Table 4 had shown the main strok es and the injury rates of 
the swimmers.  
One way ANOVA was used and the results were shown in 
Table 5. The results indicated that there was no 
significant difference  (p<0.05)  between the main stroke of

Hours of swimming and land training of the swimmers and the 
incidence rate s of injuries  
The average hours of training i n swimming and land 
training were illustrated in Table 11. The mean hours of 
swimming training per week for males and females were 7.65 
(SD±5.05) and 6.20 (SD±4.69) hours respectively and the 
mean hours of land training per week for males and females 
were 1.35 (SD±1.70) and 1.08 (SD±1.22) hours respectively. 
The mean hours of the swimming and land training were 6.77 
(SD±4.88) and 1.18 (SD±1.43) hours. Both of the groups 
showed significant mean differences, (t=3.058, p= .002) in 
the number of hours of swimmi ng training between males and 
females; and (t=1.962, p=.050) in the number of hours of 
land training between males and females. Males spent more 
time in both swimming training and land training than 
females.  
Table 12 summarized the results of independent t -test 
of the hours of swimming or land training and the injury 
occurrence of swimmers and showed there were  no significant 
mean differences , (t=2.147,  p=0.33) in the number of hours 
of swimming training between the injured and non -injured 
50 
swimmers, and (t=1 .988, p=0.48) in the number of hours of 
land training between the injured and non -injured swimmers.

 The total numbers of training hours of each 
performance group were shown in Table 13 . The mean training 
hours including th e swimming part and land training part 
were 9.00 (SD±5.84) and 7.28 (SD±5.36) hours for male and 
female swimmers. The total training hours of the 
respondents were 3476.57 hours per week, approximately 
180782 training hours per year. In the past one year, t he 
total number of injured swimmers was 154 out of 437 
swimmers and the total number of injury cases was 427 among 
the 154 swimmers.  
The incident rates of injuries (per 1000 training  
hours) of the five performance groups ranked were, in 
descending order, t he junior training squad (6.04), 
regional training squad (1.91), Hong Kong team (1.75),

Warm up patterns of the swimmers  
The warm up time patterns of swimmers were illustrated 
in Table 1 4. In both swimming and land training, swimmers 
used less than five minutes for their  warm up sections (198 
swimmers in swimming training and 204 swimmers in land 
training. In swimming training, there were 182 and 57 
swimmers used five to 10 minutes and more than ten minutes 
to warm up before starting swimming training whilst there 
were 185 and 48 swimmers spent five to 10 minutes and more 
than ten minutes for the warm up session in the land 
training.  
The One way ANOVA has shown that there was no 
significant difference between the warm up time in both 
swimming training (p=0.0 63) and land training (p=0. 267) and 
the injury rate s.

Table 15 showed the type of warm up exercises that the 
swimmers did before starting their training. It was more 
likely for the swimmers to have stretching (382 swimmers, 
87.41% before swimming training and 312 swimmers, 71.4% 
before land training) for swimmer s from every performance 
level. Other than stretching, before swimming training 
began, 123 swimmers (28.15%) had specific warm up and 76 
swimmers (17.39%) jogged. There were 181 swimmers (41.42%) 
jogged and 124 swimmers (28.38%) had specific warm up 
before the land training.

Cool down patterns of swimmers  
After training, there were 288 (65.9%) and 282 (64.5%) 
swimmers had cool down exercises after swimming and land 
training whilst there were 149 (34.1%) and 155 (35.5%) 
swimmers did not  have cool down after training.  
Table 16 illustrated the cool down patterns of swimmers 
of different performance groups. The swimmers from swimming 
clubs had the greatest percentage (69.4% for swimming and 
71.3% for land training) to cool down after train ing. 
Followed by that, the school team only swimmers had less 
percentage in having cool down after both trainings. The 
regional training squad, the Hong Kong team and the junior 
training squad has a higher percentage of swimmers (7.6% 
and 7.1%, 5.9% and 6. 0%, 2.4% and 2.8%) to perform cool 
down after training when compared with its own performance 
group. 
The independent t -test showed that there were 
significant mean differences between the cool down sessions 
in both swimming and land training ( p=0.045 and p=0.015 
respectively) and the injury rate s.

Details of injuries among injured body sites and injury 
types 
Table 17 illustrated the number of cases of each injured 
body sites and the corresponding injury types with 
different performance level groups. From the table, it is 
showed that in the upper extremities and the dorsal of the 
body, shoulder (59), lumbar spine/lo w back (39), cervical 
spine/neck (27) and wrist/hand (27) were the top four 
injured sites while in the lower extremities of the body, 
thigh/lower leg (94), ankle/foot (82) and knee (37) were 
the top three most common injured body sites.  
For the detailed in jury types over the injured body 
sites, for the upper extremities and dorsal of the body, 
sprain/strain at lumbar spine/low back (27), strain at 
shoulder (26) and sprain/strain at cervical spine/neck (20) 
were the top three injuries whereas cramps at the 
thigh/lower legs (53), sprain at ankle (46) and strain at 
the thigh/lower legs (40) were the top three injuries 
occurred in the lower extremities.  
Thigh/lower leg strain and knee contusion  (both had 
1.725 cases per 1000 training hours ) had the highest 
incident rate in the junior training squad. Among the 
61 
swimming club swimmers, cramps at thigh/lower leg was the 
most frequent injury followed by strain at thigh/ lower leg 
(0.048) and sprain at ankle (0.047). Shoulder strain and 
sprain/strain at lumbar spine/lo w back had the same 
incident rate of 0.034 (23 cases for both) and ranked 
fourth.

Background information of swimmers with shoulder injury  
Table 18 has shown the background information of 
swimmers who got the shoulder injuries. Items included the 
subjects’ dominate side an d injured side, the days for  
recovery, the occasion when injury happened, the motion of 
swimmers acquired during injury, the number of cases of 
recurrent injury, the number of cases of acute shoulder 
injury and the number of cases of participating in 
competitions after recovery.  
The most injured side was ambidextrous w ith 16 cases 
(37.2%) followed by the right side (14 cases, 32.6%) and 
left side (13 cases, 30.2%). The longest mean day of 
recovery among the performance groups was 99 days which 
equivalent to almost 3 months. Most shoulder injuries 
happened during swimmin g training (20 cases, 46.5%). At the 
moment of injury occurred, it was reported that the 
subjects were under vigorous exercise (34 cases, 79.1%).  
The recurrent rate was 41.9%, (18 cases) and there was 
only 1 acute shoulder injury case that needed to send to 
the hospital directly. The rate of participating in 
65 
competitions after recovery was high with 40 out of 43 
cases (93.0%) with 3 swimmers had withdrawn.  
There were 43 cases of shoulder injuries. Among the 
five performance groups, there was no record of s houlder 
injuries in the junior training squad  level.

Types of shoulder injury  
The types of shoulder injuries included in the study 
were listed as follow (Table 1 9): overuse, strain, 
dislocation, subluxation, sprain, inflammation and 
arthritis. Sprain at shoulders was the most frequent type 
among the five swimming styles (front crawl, butterfly, 
breaststroke, backstroke and individual medley)  with front 
crawl swimmers acquired the most. Overuse was the second 
one in front crawl and backstroke swimmers.

Recurrent rate and acute injury rate of shoulder of 
different strokes  
The recurrent rate of shoulder injuries at the same 
position was 41.86% (18 cases). The rate of br eaststroke 
swimmers was high with 5 out of 18 cases (27.8%). Swimmers 
of butterfly, individual medley, backstroke and front crawl  
were ranked in a descending order.  
Table 20  illustrated the r ecurrent rate and acute 
injury rate of shoulder of different stro kes. The acute 
injury rate was low with only 1 butterfly swimmers had been 
sent to the hospital directly due to the shoulder injury.

Treatments after first ti me and recurrent injury  
Table 21  showed the types of treatment that subjects 
had looked for after injury. When it was the first time to 
have the injury, swimmers took rest (58.1%) or seek for 
physiotherapists (27.9%) or the acupuncture treatment 
(23.3%).  Among the 18 recurrent cases, swimmers also chose 
to take rest (11 cases), seek for physiotherapists (10 
cases) or Chinese bone setters (5 cases)

The subjects were asked to compare and rate the 
performance of the muscle strength, range of motion and the 
swimming skills before and after injuries. Th e results were 
listed in Table 23  and Figure 1. Mo st subjects rated the 
three items as 3 (Neutral).

Discussion  
A total of 437 youth swimmers responded in this study.  
The result was used t o give a better understanding of the 
common injury patterns, the effect of demographic 
backgrounds including the training time, performance level 
and the type of stroke that may lead to high risk of injury. 
Similar studies have been conducted but the targe t groups 
and the design of content were different. Thus, some of the 
viewpoints between studies are worth discussing.  
Injury pattern of swimmers  
The choices of different injured sites in the study 
were basically referred to a similar study in the 2009 FINA  
World Championships (Aquatics). The respondents of that 
study were participants of the Championships and they were 
asked if they had suffered in any injuries during 
competitions and the results showed that, in the swimming 
section, shoulder and wrist/hand  injuries (9 cases for both) 
were the most injured parts followed by head/face, lumbar 
spine/low back and hip/groin (each was 5 cases)  (Mountjoy, 
et al., 2010) . The researchers concluded at the end that 
most of the injuries were not acute but caused by ove ruse. 
74 
Differ from the FINA study, this study recorded 
swimmers injury pattern s over the past one year which means 
that the injuries may not happened during swimming 
competitions but during or after trainings. One of the aims 
of the current study was to inve stigate the injury patterns 
among the youth swimmers over the past one year so as to 
serve as a reference for further study in comparing the 
probability of injury incidence s during different occasions 
for example, during and after training,  injury pattern s 
between swimmers  and other sports participants like field 
athletes and volleyball players.  
From the result of our study, it is obvious that in 
the upper extremities and body trunk, sprain/strain at 
lumbar spine/low back (27 cases) and strain at shoulder (26 
cases) were re markable injured sites. In 2008, XVIth FINA 
(Federation Internationale De Natation) World Sports 
Medicine Congress was held in Manchester, Great Britain. In 
the Congress, the topic about injuries in aquatic athletes 
was being discussed. Presentation topics  included 1) 
Tendinopathies in Sports, 2) Management of shoulder 
problems in swimming and 3) Assessment and management of 
lumbar spine problems  (FINA, 2008) . The presented topics  
75 
were chosen because of their eye -catching statistics on 
swimmers which  were consistent with the findings from our 
study.  
 
Shoulder injuries of swim mers 
The shoulder injury rate of front crawl swimmers were 
very high with 20 cases of different types of injury. 
Several studies have been conducted on the biomechanical 
analysis of front crawl. In the front crawl, the arm stroke 
provided a backward pull a nd push in order to swim forward. 
This motion involved lot s of muscle groups, for examples, 
trapezius,pectoralis major, latissimus dorsi, deltoid and 
rotator cuff. There were several factors that affect the 
injury incidence of the shoulder joint. These muscle groups 
were attached around the shoulder joint  (glenohumeral  
joint). Overtraining or overreaching could bring ha rm to 
these muscle groups.  
According  to the results, t he mean training hours of 
swimming training among the swimmers wa s 6.77(SD±4.88) 
hours per week  and there w ere significant mean difference 
between the hours of training  in both swimming sessions and 
76 
land training sessions  among the male and female swimmers . 
From the findings , the incidence rate of injuries is 0.28 
per 1000 training hours which was  closed to the result of 
0.39/1000h in the study of Knobloch, Yoon, Kraemer & Vogt 
(2008). The demand and intensity of the training and the 
physiological status for example, muscle fibre type, 
strength and power of the muscles of th e swimmers would 
greatly affect the chance of occurrence of the injury 
incidence  (Sortwell, 2012) . 
Pink and Tibone reported that among the 233 
competitive swimmers, 44% of swimmers had anterior -superior 
region, 26% had diffuse pain, 14% had anterior -inferior 
region, 10% had posterior -superior region  and 4% in 
posterior -inferior region (Pink & Tibone, 2000) . Compared 
with the current result, it could not reflect the positions 
of the shoulder injuries but the types only. Further 
investigation could be made on  this issue.  
From the results of the current findings, there was no  
significant difference between injury incident rates and  
the main swimming style they had . These were consistent 
with Wolf et al.  findings (2009). 
77 
 
Treating injuries, Prevention and Promote Health  
In the third part of the study, most respondents 
mentioned that they took rest or seek help from 
physiotherapists. In the 2008 Manchester Congress, Dr. 
Gillett mentioned in the presentation ab out the diagnostic 
methods in treating the lumbar spine pain while Dr.Rodeo 
focused on the swimmer’s shoulder  (FINA, 2008) . The focus 
of the injured body sites on the Congress had also matched 
and reflected in the injury rates of the current study  
(shoulder region) . 
Moreover, Shona Halson  from the Australian Institute 
of Sport did a review on the overreaching and the 
overtraining syndrome in swimmers in varies aspects: 
performance, lactate, endocrine system, immune system and 
mood state (Halson, 2011) . It is found that the m entioned 
areas could be the potential indicatiors of the 
overtraining syndrome whereas the ‘useful indicators 
include the performance on standard exercise test and self -
analysis of well being. Halson also suggested some ways for 
swimmers to recover from in tense training like hydrotherapy, 
78 
hot/cold water immersion and sleep (in quantity and 
quality).  
It is important to teach swimmers and coaches to 
understand the symptoms and differences in shoulder pain 
and soreness so as to minimize the continuous demage t o 
swimmer’s shoulders and help the athletes to recover and 
engage to the training again.  Coaches should also set up 
swimming conditioning program that involved muscular 
endurance, resistance training , flexibility of muscular 
muscles and joints,  and strengthening exercises on sh oulder 
muscle groups , for example, rotator cuffs , external and 
internal rotators,  adductors and abductors . Although ,from 
the study, it was shown that there was no significant mean 
difference between the warm up patterns and the injury 
rates, warm up exercise is essential to every athletes so 
as to prepare the body to  get into the status of ready to 
participate in order to prevent from getting injuries . Cool 
down stretching is also important in bring down the heart 
rate muscle state back to normal and minimize the effects 
of fatig ue.

Chapter 5  
Summary and Conclusions  
This chapter consists of three main parts. They are (1) 
Summary of Results (2) Conclusion and (3) Recommendations 
for Future Study.  
Summary of Results  
The results of the study were summarized as follows:  
1. Out of the 437 respondents, there were 154 of them 
(35.2%) got injured in the past one year. The injury 
rates of each performance group were 1.8% for the Hong 
Kong Team, 2.3% for the R egional training squad, 0.7% 
for the junior training squad , 25.6% for the swimming 
clubs swimmers and 4.8% for those trained in school 
swimming team only.  The One way ANOVA has shown that 
there was no significant difference between the 
performance level of  the swimmers and the injury rates.  
2. The distribution of the main swimming stroke of swimmers 
was identified. For choosing front crawl as the main 
stroke, there were 147 swimmers; for breaststroke, there 
were 112 swimmers; for backstroke, there were 86 
80 
swimmers; for butterfly, there were 63 swimmers. 29 
swimmers who were good at the four swimming strokes 
chose individual medley as their main swimming style. 
One way ANOVA showed that there was no significant 
difference (p=0.451) between the main strokes of 
swimmers and their injury rates.  
3. There were 2 47 swimmers had participated in the 
2010/2011 Championships . The One way ANOVA showed there 
was significant mean difference (p=0.041) between these 
232 swimmers (categorized into A, B, C grades) and the 
injury rates. I n the 2011/2012 Championships, 344 
swimmers had participated  and the One way ANOVA showed 
that there was no significant difference (p=0.543) 
between these 344 swimmers and the injury rate s. Within 
the 437 swimmers, there were 232 swimmers who had 
participat ed in both 2010/2011 and 2011/2012 
Championships. The One way ANOVA has shown that there 
was no significant difference (p=0.863) between these 
swimmers and the injury rates.  
4. The mean training hours per week in swimming and fitness 
sessions were 6.77 (SD ±4.88) and 1.18 (SD ±1.43) 
81 
respectively. The independent t -test showed that there 
was significant difference (p=o.33) between the training 
hours (both swimming and fitness training) of and the 
injury occurrence.  
5. The total training hours of the 437 respondents 
(including swimming and fitness training sessions) was 
3476.57 hours per week. The total number of injury 
incidents was 427 cases. The incidence rate of injuries 
was 0.28 injuries per 1000 training hours.  
6. The warm up time of training (both swimming and fit ness 
training) were divided into 3 categories: less than 5 
minutes, 5 to 10 minutes and more than 10 minutes. There 
were 198 and 204 swimmers had less than 5 minutes for 
their warm up in swimming and fitness trainings 
respectively;182 (swimming training) a nd 185 (land 
training) swimmers used 5 to 10 minutes and 57 and 48 
swimmers used more than 10 minutes for their warm up in 
the swimming and land training sessions. The One way 
ANOVA showed that there was no significant difference 
between the warm up time i n both swimming training 
82 
(p=0.063) and land training (p=0.267) and the injury 
rates. 
7. The warm up exercises were divided into four types: 
jogging, stretching, specific warm up and others. The 
percentages of swimmers’ choices in the types of warm up 
were as f ollow: (during swimming training) 17.39%, 
87.41%, 28.15% and 8.24% in jogging, stretching, 
specific warm up and others like sit -up and push up; 
(during land training) 41.42%, 71.4%, 28.38%, 13.96% in 
jogging, stretching, specific warm up and others like 
rope skipping.  
8. The cool down patterns of swimmers were similar. 288 
swimmers had cool down after swimming training wh ile 282 
swimmers had cool down after land training.  The 
independent t -test showed that there were significant 
mean differences between the coo l down sessions in both 
swimming and land training (p=0.045 and p=0.015 
respectively) and the injury rates. 
9. The four most injured body sites in the upper 
extremities and dorsal trunk were shoulder (59 cases), 
lumbar spine/low back (39 cases), cervical spine /neck 
83 
(27 cases) and wrist/hand (27 cases); in the lower 
extremities, thigh/lower leg (94 cases), ankle/foot (82 
cases) and knee (37 cases) were the three most common 
injured body sites.  Among the swimming club swimmers, 
muscle cramps at thigh/lower leg wa s the most frequent 
injury followed by strain at thigh/ lower leg (0.048) 
and sprain at ankle (0.047). Shoulder strain and 
sprain/strain at lumbar spine/low back had the same 
incident rate of 0.034 (23 cases for both) and ranked 
fourth. 
10. There were 43 cases  of injuries among the 437 
respondents. For those who suffered in the shoulder 
injuries, the most injured side was ambidextrous with 16 
cases (37.2%) followed by the right side (14 cases, 
32.6%) and left side (13 cases, 30.2%). it was reported 
that, at the  moment of injury occurred, the subjects 
were under vigorous exercise (34 cases, 79.1%).  There 
was no of shoulder injuries recorded in the junior 
training squad level of swimmers.  
11. In the five swimming styles, front crawl swimmers 
suffered the most (20 case s), followed by butterfly (14 
84 
cases), backstroke (12 cases), breaststroke (9 cases) 
and individual medley swimmers (8 cases).  
12. The recurrent rate of shoulder injuries at the same 
position was 41.86% (18 cases). There was only one case 
that swimmers needed t o be sent to the hospital directly.  
13. After suffered in the shoulder injuries for the first 
time, swimmers took rest (58.1%) or seek for 
physiotherapists (27.9%) or the acupuncture treatment 
(23.3%).  Among the 18 recurrent cases, swimmers also 
chose to take rest (11 cases), seek for physiotherapists 
(10 cases) or Chinese bone setters (5 cases)  
14.  Within the 43 swimmers who were suffered from shoulder 
injuries, 5 of them have been stayed in the hospital; 7 
of them did not stop training and 18 of them did not 
stop involving in sports activities.  
15. After recovered from the shoulder injuries, 22 
respondents rated that their muscle strength and 
swimming skills were in different (3, rating 1 -5) as 
before injury while 20 of them rated 3 (neutral) in the 
range of motion o f the shoulder joint.  
85 
Conclusion  
This study gave a general injury patterns among the 
competitive swimmers in Hong Kong. Although the injuries 
incidents in swimming were not serious, it is essential to 
reduce the injury rate to minimize the effect on swimmers’ 
performance and the chance of recurrent injuries.  Therefore, 
the training programs for swimmers should be well -planned 
and revised regularly in order to enhance swimmers’ 
strength and abilities and to maximize their limits.  
Recommendation s for Further Studies  
Base on the s tudy, the following recommendation s are 
presented for further studies:  
1. The items and choices of injuries were limited. It may 
not be able to reflect all the problems.  
2. Studies may focus on general group and other training 
groups, e.g. the general public and hig h level 
competitions.  
3. Study may focus on general injury types or injured sites, 
which may give the outline of the injury patterns, thus 
move onto the correlation between the specific injured 
sites of swimming and other sports.  
86 
4. Study may focus on the speci fic strokes and the 
corresponding injured sites. Detailed result may provide 
advice in setting up of preventive measure or specific 
training program, e.g. different kind of swimming 
strokes and the common injured sites in swimming.  
5. Developmental research c an be conducted in longitudinal 
approach of the injured swimmers to follow up the 
injured site status and swimmers’ participation in 
swimming competitions after injury, e.g. the specific 
treatment s and the recovery periods. 
6. Qualitative studies can be conducted  to acquire in -depth 
understanding of the mechanism of injury, which enable a 
more meaningful conclusion, e.g. which specific skill or 
action leading to a particular injury.  
7. Research can include new and recurrent injuries of other 
injured sites, to find ou t any relationship between them.  
8. Research can include other injured sites about the 
relationship between the dominant and non -dominant sides 
of the swimmers and their injuries, to find out any 
relationship between them.  
9. Research can include the skeletal an d muscular contents 
of swimmers and other sports participants, to find out 
87 
the sports type that affects the particular bone and 
muscle content which may lead to the common injuries, 
e.g. the relationship between the bone density of 
swimmers and basketball players and the rate of fracture.  
10. Experimental studies can be conduct in the relationship 
between the quantity of swimming training and the land 
training in the skeletal muscular content or the 
recovery of the injured sites.  
11. Research can include the expen se on medication for 
injury. 
12. Research can include psychological impact  on swimmers 
after injury.  
13. Research can include what the swimmers will do to reduce 
the risk of injuries.
