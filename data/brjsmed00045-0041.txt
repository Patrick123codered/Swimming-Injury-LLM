ABSTRACT
Aspartofalongitudinal studyofchildren, 941mothers wereaskedtoreportontheirchildrens' swimming experiences and
abilities. Atagenine,twenty-nine percentofthechildren couldswimonlyafewstrokes ornotatall.Adisproportionate
number ofchildren whocouldswimmorethanafewstrokescamefromhighsocio-economic backgrounds, fromfamilies
whereoneormoreoftheparentscouldswim,andwhichscoredhigheronanindexofactiverecreational orientation. There
werenosignificant sexdifferences inswimming ability.Therewere97incidents reported whereachildhadbeenindiffi-
cultieswhileinwaterandhadtoberescued. Theimportance ofcollecting dataonsuchincidents isdiscussed.
INTRODUCTION
Drowning isthesecond major causeofinjurymortality
among children inNewZealand (Langley, 1983).In1979,
therewere185children whodiedasaresultofaninjury.
Sixty-nine diedasaresultofmotorvehicle trafficrelated
injuries, andfortyfromdrowning. Neardrowning incidents
receivelessprominence sincethereisoften noassociated
injury,andthustheyarenotrecorded inmorbidity statis-
tics.Nevertheless, theseincidents arerelatively common.
Forexample, Fergusson, Harwood andShannon (1983) re-
ported94domestic swimming poolincidents inthefirstfive
yearsoflifeinacohortof1,123children. Mostofthese
incidents wereconsidered relatively minor.Sixwerecon-
sidered tohavebeenpotentially fatalbut,nevertheless,
required nomedical treatment. Typically, theseevents are
described asimmersion incidents (PearnandNixon,1977;
Walker andMiddelkamp, 1981).Data onimmersion
incidents notresulting inhospitalisation forolderNew
Zealand children arenotavailable.
There areseveral countermeasures which canbe
implemented toreduce childhood drownings andnear
drownings. Fortheyoungchild,emphasis isplaced on
modifying theenvironment (e.g.fencing swimming pools)
andparental vigilance. Aschildren getolder,greater
emphasis isplaced onteaching thechildtoswim.Despite
theimportance ofthelatterstrategy, littleisknownof
children's swimming abilityanditsdeterminants.
Thisstudyrepresents afollow upofanearlierinvestiga-
tionwhichreported swimming experiences andabilities of
sevenyearolds(Langley, SilvaandWilliams, 1981).Inaddi-
tiontoobtaining moredetailed information onswimming
ability, theinvestigation alsosought toexamine the
relationship ofparents' swimming ability, thesexofthe
child,socio-economic status,andthefamily's active recrea-
tionalorientation tothechild'sswimming ability.
METHOD
Thedatawerecollected during theninthphaseofthe
Dunedin Multidisciplinary HealthandDevelopment Study.
Thisisalongitudinal studyofthehealth,development and
behaviour ofasample ofNewZealand children whowere
bornatDunedin's onlyobstetric hospital between 1stApril,
1972and31stMarch,1973.Thesample wasdrawnfromall
children bornatQueenMaryHospital inthatyearwhose
mothers hadbeenresident inthemetropolitan areaand
whostilllivedintheDunedin areaortheprovince ofOtago
whenthechildren werethree yearsofage.Ofthe1,139
children whowereeligibleforinclusion inthesample atage
three,955wereassessed neartheirninthbirthday. The
sample wasgenerally ofhighersocio-economic groupsand
under-representative ofMaorisandPolynesians compared
withNewZealand asawhole.Acomplete description ofthe
natureofthestudyandthestudysample isprovided by
McGeeandSilva(1982).Atthenineyearassessment, mothers wereasked;
whether theycouldswim,toprovide detailsoftheirchild's
swimming experiences andabilities, andwhether their
childhadeverbeenindifficulties inwaterandhadtobe
rescued.
Thesocio-economic statusofthechildwasbasedonthe
occupation ofthefather orbreadwinner andcoded
according totheElleyandIrving(1976)socio-economic
index.TheElleyandIrvingScalegroupstheoccupations
listedintheNewZealand censusintosixordered levels,
rangingfromgroup1(high)togroup6(low).
Theextenttowhichthefamilyparticipated actively in
variousrecreational andsporting activities wasassessed by
theActiveRecreational Orientation subscale oftheFamily
Environment Scale(MoosandMoos,1981).
Results wereanalysed usingchi-squared testsanda
student's t-test.TheBonferroni inequality wasusedto
controlforpossible inflation oftheType1errorrate(GroveandAndreasen, 1982).Thus,thefourindependent variables
weretestedatp<0.01(0.05divided by4)tomaintain the
overallType1errorrateat0.05.
RESULTS
Eighthundred andtwenty-two (87%)ofthe941mothers
whocompleted thequestionnaire reported thattheycould
swim.Slightly more(88%)ofthemothers reported that
theirhusbands couldswim.Twenty percentofthechildren
weremembers ofaswimming club.Themajority of
mothers (95%)confirmed thattheirchildcouldimmerse
himself orherselfcompletely inwaterwithconfidence (i.e.
openeyes,exhale,relax).Ninety-seven (10%)children were
considered tohavebeenindifficulties inwaterandhadto
berescued. Therewerenoinjuries associated withthese
events,norwerethereanysignificant sexdifferences (X2=
0.0ldfp>0.05).
TableIsetsoutthedistance thechildwasconsidered to
beabletoswim.Inthosecaseswhereitwasindicated that
thechildcouldswim(N=823),themotherwasaskedwho
hadbeenthechild'sprincipal swimming instructor while
learning. In49percentofthecases,thiswasaswimming
instructor. In32percentofthecasestheinstructor wasa
schoolteacher, andin11percentofthecasesaparent.The
remaining 8percentofthechildren weretaughtbyother
persons.
Forsubsequent analyses, thosechildren whowerenotable
toswimorcouldonlyswimafewstrokeswerecategorised
as"non-swimmers" andtheremainder, thosewhocould
swim10metresormore,werecategorised as"swimmers".Table11setsouttheresultsforsex,socio-economic status,
parents' swimming abilityandthefamilies' activerecrea-
tionalorientation. Therewasnosignificant sexdifferences39

between non-swimmers andswimmers. Thosewhowere
swimmers weremoreoftenfromhighsocio-economic
backgrounds, moreoftenhadparents whocouldswimand
camefromfamilies whichhadsignificantly highermean
scoresonameasure ofactiverecreational orientation.
Sincetherewasnosocio-economic statusindexforchildren
without afatherfigure,aseparate analysis wasundertaken
whichexamined therelationship between parentstatus
(soloversusnon-solo) andswimming ability.Thisanalysis
showed thattherewasnosignificant relationship between
thetwovariables.

DISCUSSION
Thefinding that87percentofthemothers could swim is
similar tothatreported byButtleandRhind(1978a) inatele-
phone survey of100households, where in92cases the
respondent wasamother. Inthatsurvey, 81percentoftherespondents reported thattheywereabletoswim.
Atageseven,53percentofthechildren werereported as
beingabletoswimatleast"afewstrokes" (Langley etal,
1981).Theresultspresented hereshowthat87percentof
thechildren wereabletoachieve thislevelofperformance
bytheirninthbirthday. Thisimprovement probably reflects
increased school swimming programmes andprivate
instruction withincreasing age.Whilsttheabilitytoswima
fewstrokesisclearlypreferable tonotbeingabletoswimat
all,therearethosewhowouldconsider thisperformance to
indicate inability toswim.UsingNixon, Pearnand
Dugdale's (1979)swimming abilitycriteriaof10metresor
more,29percentofthesamplewereunabletoswim.This
findingisofconcern giventhatnexttopreschoolers, the5-9
agegroupisatthegreatest riskofdrowning (Department of
Health,1982).Moreover, theolderchildismorelikelyto
drown innon-domestic environments (e.g.rivers,sea)
which,unlikedomestic environments, arefromapractical
viewpoint impossible tomodify tominimise theriskof
drowning. Underthesesituations anabilitytoswim
assumes greaterimportance.
Thefindingthat71percentofthechildren wereableto
swim10metresormorebytheirninthbirthday islessthan
thatreported intheQueensland studywherethecompar-
ablefigurewas84percent.Thehigherpercentage for
Queensland isprobably attributable toavarietyoffactors,
including hightemperatures, andahigherrateofprivate
swimming poolownership (Nixonetal,1979).
Swimming abilityaloneshould notbeseenasthe
ultimate panacea. TheBrisbane Drowning Studyshowed
thatapproximately oneineveryfivechildren overtheageof
fiveyearswhodrowned couldnevertheless swim(Pearn,
NixonandWilkey, 1976).Clearly, amixofstrategies is
required tominimise drownings. Inaddition toensuring
thatchildren canswim,otherstrategies include ensuring
lifejackets arewornandwhenappropriate, bathing and
swimming inseaareaspatrolled bysurflifesavers,
developing underwater skills,andensuring thevictim
receives rapidandappropriate firstaid(Langley, 1983).
ButtleandRhind(1978b) reported thatwhenasked
whosedutyitwastoteachthechildren toswim,49percent
oftheparents sawitastheirduty.Theresultsshowthatthe
parents reliedonswimming instructors andteachers to
providetheprincipal instruction.
Theresultsshowthattherewerenosignificant differ-
encesbetween boysandgirlsinswimming ability.Nixonet
al(1979)reported thesamefindinginaQueensland study.
Theseresultssuggest thattherepeatedly demonstrated
higherimmersion rateamongboyscannotbeattributable
tosexdifferences inswimming ability.Therewasasigni-
ficantrelationship between socio-economic statusand
swimming ability,withswimmers beingover-represented
inthehighsocio-economic levels.Thisfindingissimilarto
thatreported byNixonetal(1979).Children whocould
swimweremorelikelytocomefromfamilies whereboth
parents couldswimthanfromfamilies whereonlyone
parentcouldswimorneithercould.Thechildren whocould
swimwereshowntohavecomefromfamilies whichplacedsignificantly moreemphasis onactiverecreation thanthose
families wherethechildcouldnotswim.There areavariety
ofplausible explanations forthesefindings. Highsocio-
economic groups areprobably morelikelytohavetheir
ownswimming poolsandbeinaposition topayforprivate
swimming instruction. Thoseparents whocanswimare
probably morelikelytoexpose theirchildren towater
environments andtoencourage themtoparticipate in
swimming andwater-related activities. Similarly, parents
withactiverecreational interests areprobably morelikelyto
41
beinterested ingoingswimming andparticipating inwater
sports,thusencouraging theirchildren toswim.Despitethe
statistical significance oftheassociations between socio-
economic status,parents' swimming ability,parents' active
recreational orientation, andchild'sswimming ability,no
singleassociation accounted formorethansixpercentof
thevariance inswimming ability.Factors whichmaybe
moreimportant indetermining swimming abilityinclude
whether thereisswimming instruction atschool, and
distances families livefrombeaches, riversandswimming
pools.
The97immersion incidents reported areprobably an
underestimate giventhesevenyearrecallperiod.Whilstthe
dataisnotdirectly comparable withthatproduced by
Fergusson etal(1983)theirfindings suggest thatthe
number ofincidents reported hereshould havebeen
higher,particularly whenitisconsidered thatthisstudywas
notconfined toswimming poolincidents. Asidefromthe
differences inrecallperiod,thereareseveralotherpossible
factorswhichmayaccount forthelowerreported ratein
Dunedin. Themostlikelyexplanation isthedifference in
climate. Christchurch receives approximately 18percent
moresunshine hourseachyearandhasahighermean
summer temperature thanDunedin (Department of
Statistics, 1982).ThusitseemslikelythatChristchurch
children described byFergusson etal(1983)wouldbe
exposed towaterhazardsofalltypesmoreoften.
Theabsence ofasexdifference intheimmersion
incidents reported heresuggests thatcontrolshouldbe
exercised inextrapolating fromimmersion incidents
resulting ininjury,whereboysareatgreaterrisk(Depart-
mentofHealth,1980)toincidents whichdonotresultinany
injury.
In1979therewere40children whodiedasaresultof
drowning inNewZealand (Department ofHealth,1982).
Hospital andSelected Morbidity Data(Department of
Health,1980)forthesameyearshowsthat63children were
eitherdischarged, transferred fromordiedinpublicor
privatehospitals asaresultofimmersion incidents. These
statistics, coupled withthedatafromthisstudyandthatof
Fergusson etal(1983),demonstrate thatthemajority of
immersion incidents donotresultininjuryanddonotcome
totheattention ofthehealthservices. Therelativerarityof
mortality andthelowmorbidity ratenecessitates thatthe
circumstances ofimmersion incidents notresulting ininjury
bedescribed ifcountermeasures aretobedeveloped and
evaluated morerapidlythanatpresent.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
