Background The Olympic Movement Medical Code
encourages all stakeholders to ensure that sport is
practised without danger to the health of the athletes.
Systematic surveillance of injuries and illnesses is the
foundation for developing preventive measures in sport.
Aim To analyse the injuries and illnesses that occurred
during the Games of the XXX Olympiad, held in London
in 2012.
Methods We recorded the daily occurrence (or non-
occurrence) of injuries and illnesses (1) through the
reporting of all National Olympic Committee (NOC)
medical teams and (2) in the polyclinic and medical
venues by the London Organising Committee of the
Olympic and Paralympic Games ’(LOCOG) medical staff.
Results In total, 10 568 athletes (4676 women and
5892 men) from 204 NOCs participated in the study.
NOC and LOCOG medical staff reported 1361 injuries
and 758 illnesses, equalling incidences of 128.8
injuries and 71.7 illnesses per 1000 athletes. Altogether,
11% and 7% of the athletes incurred at least one injury
or illness, respectively. The risk of an athlete being
injured was the highest in taekwondo, football, BMX,
handball, mountain bike, athletics, weightlifting, hockey
and badminton, and the lowest in archery, canoe slalom
and sprint, track cycling, rowing, shooting and
equestrian. 35% of the injuries were expected to prevent
the athlete from participating during competition or
training. Women suffered 60% more illnesses than men
(86.0 vs 53.3 illnesses per 1000 athletes). The rate of
illness was the highest in athletics, beach volleyball,
football, sailing, synchronised swimming and
taekwondo. A total of 310 illnesses (41%) affected the
respiratory system and the most common cause of illness
was infection (n=347, 46%).
Conclusions At least 11% of the athletes incurred an
injury during the games and 7% of the athletes ’an
illness. The incidence of injuries and illnesses varied
substantially among sports. Future initiatives should
include the development of preventive measures tailored
for each speci ﬁc sport and the continued focus among
sport bodies to institute and further develop scienti ﬁc
injury and illness surveillance systems.
INTRODUCTION
According to the Olympic Charter, the codi ﬁcation
governing the organisation and operation of the
Olympic Movement, one of the main roles of the
International Olympic Committee (IOC) is to
encourage and support measures protecting the
health of athletes.1Systematic monitoring of injuryand illness trends over long periods of time pro-
vides epidemiological data that are indispensable to
identify and subsequently reduce injuries and ill-
nesses in high-risk sports and disciplines.2Thus, to
maximise the health protection and bene ﬁts of elite
athletes, as well as to minimise the direct and indir-
ect costs associated with injury and illness, the early
identiﬁcation of athletes at a high risk and subse-
quent development and introduction of effective
prevention tools are signi ﬁcant goals for the IOC.
As early as 1998, the Fédération Internationale
de Football Association (FIFA) started to survey all
injuries incurring during their competitions,3–8and
other major sports federations followed their
lead.9–16Based on these experiences, a group of
experts, convened by the IOC, developed an injury
surveillance system for multi-sport events.17It was
successfully implemented for the ﬁrst time in the
2008 Beijing (surveillance of injuries only)18and in
the 2010 Vancouver Olympics (surveillance of both
injuries and illnesses).19W e further developed and
optimised it for the Games of the XXX Olympiad,
held in London in 2012 (hereafter referred to as
the‘London Games ’).
With almost 11 000 athletes from 204 countries,
the London Games was one of the largest sports
events ever. The aim of the present paper is to
analyse the injuries and illnesses that occurred in
London, with the long-term aim to enable the
National Olympic Committees (NOCs) and
International Federations (IF) to improve their
work on protection of their athletes ’health.
Practical implications and suggestions for further
research to protect the athletes ’health are
provided.
METHODS
W e employed the IOC injury and illness surveil-
lance system for multisport events to record injuries
and illnesses in the present study.18 19First, we
asked all NOC head physicians to report the daily
occurrence (or non-occurrence) of newly sustained
injuries and illnesses on a standardised form.
Second, we retrieved the same information on all
athletes treated for injuries and illnesses in the
polyclinic and medical venues by the London
Organising Committee of the Olympic and
Paralympic Games ’(LOCOG) medical staff.
Implementation
W e informed the NOCs about the study in a letter
sent 4 months in advance of the Olympic Games.

The day before the opening of the Games, we invited the
medical staff of the NOCs to a meeting covering the details of
the study. In this meeting, we also started the distribution of the
daily injury and illness report forms, as well as an instructional
booklet detailing the study protocol.
Throughout the data collection, we recorded the response
rate of NOCs having more than 30 participating athletes, and
frequently visited these to encourage continuous medical report-
ing throughout the games.
Deﬁnition of injury and illness
We d eﬁned injuries and illnesses as new (pre-existing, not fully
rehabilitated conditions were not recorded) or recurring (ath-
letes having returned to full participation after a previous condi-
tion) musculoskeletal complaints or concussions (injuries) or
illnesses incurred during competition or training during the
London Olympic Games (27 July –12 August 2012) receiving
medical attention, regardless of the consequences with respect
to absence from competition or training.17Injuries and illnesses
occurring in football were recorded 25 July onwards, the
opening date of the football competition. In cases where a
single incident caused multiple injury types or affected multiple
body parts, we recorded only the most severe diagnosis.17 19 20
Injury and illness report form
The injury and illness report form was identical to the one
introduced in the XXI Olympic Winter Games in Vancouver in
2010.19With respect to injuries, we recorded the following
information: accreditation number, sport and event, whether
the injury occurred during competition or training, date and
time, body part, type, cause and estimated time lost from com-
petition or training. Likewise, we recorded the following infor-
mation for illnesses: accreditation number, sport and event,
date, diagnosis, affected system, main symptom(s), cause and
estimated time loss.
W e provided instructions on how to complete the form cor-
rectly in the instructional booklet. W e distributed the injury and
illness report forms to all NOCs in the following languages:
English, French, Arabic, Chinese, German, Japanese, Russian
and Spanish.
Conﬁdentiality and ethical approval
W e recorded and utilised the athlete ’s accreditation number to
control for duplicates resulting from certain athletes being
treated for the same condition by both the NOC and the
LOCOG medical teams. In cases of duplicates, we retained the
NOC data. W e also used the accreditation number to query
the IOC athlete database for the athletes ’age, gender, national-
ity and sport. W e treated all information with strict con ﬁdence,
and anonymised our medical database at the end of the Games.
The study was approved by the medical research ethics com-
mittee of the South-Eastern Norway Regional Health Authority ,
Norway, and by the University College London Research Ethics
Committee, UK.
Data analysis
W e calculated the summary measure of injury and illness inci-
dence (i) according to the formula i=n/e, where n is the number
of injuries or illnesses during competition, training or in total
during the study period and e the respective number of exposed
athletes. W e calculated CIs of the relative risk (RR) of the
number of injuries or illnesses between two groups by a simple
Poisson model, assuming constant hazard per group. W e presentinjury and illness incidences as means and rate ratios with 95%
CIs. W e regarded two-tailed p values ≤0.05 as signi ﬁcant.
RESULTS
In total, 10 568 athletes took part in the London Olympic
Games. Of these, 4676 were women (44%) and 5892 men
(56%).
Incidence and distribution of injuries
Among these athletes, we recorded a total of 1361 injuries,
equalling an overall injury rate of 128.8 injuries per 1000 regis-
tered athletes (table 1). On average, 11% of the athletes sus-
tained at least one injury (n=1190). There were 114, 18 and 7
athletes with two, three and four injuries, respectively. The risk
of an athlete to be injured was the highest in taekwondo, foot-
ball, BMX, handball, mountain bike, hockey, weightlifting, ath-
letics and badminton (15 –39% of registered athletes were
affected in each sport). The relative injury risk was the lowest
for archery, canoe slalom and sprint, track cycling, rowing,
shooting and equestrian (less than 5% of the athletes were
injured). The injury rates in women (132.8 injuries per 1000
athletes (95% CI 122.4 to 143.3)) and men (121.0 (112.1 to
129.9) was similar (RR=1.10 (0.97 to 1.22), p=0.11) (table 2).
However, male athletes were at signi ﬁcantly higher risk of injury
in taekwondo (RR=1.9 (1.1 to 3.5), p=0.03), whereas women
were at higher risk of injury in football (RR=1.7 (1.2 to 2.2),
p<0.001).
Severity, location and type of injuries
While two-thirds of the injuries were estimated to not result in
any time loss from sport (n=879, 65%), a total of 482 (35%)
injuries were expected to prevent the athlete from participating
in competition or training. It was estimated that 246 (18%)
injuries would result in an absence from sports for 1 –3 days, 62
(5%) in an absence for 4 –7 days, 105 (8%) in an absence for
8–28 days and 69 (5%) in an absence for more than 28 days.
A total of 174 injuries (13%) entailed an estimated absence
from training or competition for more than 1 week (table 1).
These injuries were 10 shoulder, elbow and knee dislocations
(in hockey, football, judo, BMX and weightlifting); 38 muscle
strains, of which 24 were thigh strains (mostly in athletics); 24
fractures (mostly in team sports; all body locations) and 6 stress
fractures (4 in running events); 8 Achilles, knee and shoulder
tendon ruptures (in athletics, badminton, handball and basket-
ball); 47 ligament sprains (across all joints and sports) and 15
knee sprains, including 6 ACL and 1 PCL ruptures (in fencing,
handball, judo, wrestling, badminton, table tennis, tennis and
football). None of the six reported concussions (3 in football, 1
each in water polo, athletics and BMX) were classi ﬁed as severe.
Mechanisms and circumstances of injury
The four most commonly reported injury mechanisms were
overuse (n=346, 25%), non-contact trauma (n=275, 20%),
contact with another athlete (n=197, 14%) and contact with a
stationary object (n=164, 12%). Strati ﬁed by sport, overuse was
the mechanism for 73% of all diving injuries, 34% of athletics
and weightlifting injuries and 28% and 26% of swimming and
fencing injuries, respectively. Non-contact trauma was a frequent
mechanism in tennis (48% of all tennis injuries), beach volley-
ball and canoe sprint (43% each), fencing (39%), badminton
(35%) and athletics (28%). In contrast, more than 40% of the
injuries in basketball, football, handball and judo were caused
by contact with another athlete. Of all overuse injuries, 234

(68%) were recorded with no estimated absence from competi-
tion or training.
The distribution of injuries during competition and training
was similar, with 55% occurring in competition and 45%
during training. Injuries during training and in competition dif-
fered signi ﬁcantly in all injury characteristics (location, type,
mechanism and subsequent time loss from sport) and in terms
of the different sports (table 1). Seventy- ﬁve per cent of all
injuries in team sports occurred in competitions, whereas 60%
of all injuries in athletics were sustained during training.
Furthermore, of the more severe injuries, entailing an estimated
absence from training or competition of more than 1 week,
81% occurred during competition.Incidence and distribution of illnesses
Among the 10 568 athletes, a total of 758 illnesses were
reported, resulting in an incidence of 71.7 illnesses per 1000
athletes (table 1). On average, 7% of the athletes incurred an
illness. The incidence of illnesses was signi ﬁcantly higher in
women compared to male athletes (86.0 vs 53.3 illnesses per
1000 athletes, RR=1.6 (95% CI 1.4 to 1.9), p<0.001).
Illnesses were reported from a variety of sports. In athletics,
beach volleyball, football, sailing, synchronised swimming and
taekwondo, just over 10% of the athletes suffered from at least
one illness (table 1). The peak in relative illness rates occurred
in beach volleyball, where 19% of the players suffered from an
illness during the Games.Table 1 Rates of overall injuries, injuries leading to time loss ( ≥1 or >7 days of estimated absence), competition and training injuries and

Affected system, causes, symptoms and severity of illness
A total of 310 illnesses (41%) affected the respiratory system,
and these were most frequently observed in athletics, beach vol-
leyball, football, swimming and water polo (3 –5% of the ath-
letes). In beach volleyball, 61% of the illnesses were reported to
be respiratory infections. The second and third most affected
systems were the gastrointestinal tract (n=123, 16%) and
dermatology (n=83, 11%), respectively.
Concomitantly, infection was the most common cause of
illness (n=347, 46%), affecting athletes in mainly the same
sports as mentioned above. Symptoms of pain were present in
209 (16%) of the illnesses. However, for a third (248, 33%) of
all illnesses, symptoms were not reported.Almost one in ﬁve illnesses (n=145, 19%) were expected to
result in absence from training or competition. Of these, nine
illnesses were expected to result in an estimated time loss of
more than 7 days (7 cases of stress, fatigue and exhaustion; 1
upper respiratory tract infection and 1 instance of abdominal
pain).
Response rate and coverage of the athletes
Seventy-four of the 204 NOCs had more than 30 participating
athletes. Athletes from these NOCs comprised 9450 of the total
10 568 athletes, corresponding to 89% (table 3). Throughout
the 17 days of the London Games, the 74 NOCs submitted aTable 2 Rates of overall injuries and injuries leading to time loss (>7 days of estimated absence) in female and male athletes in the Olympic

total of 1204 of a maximum of 1258 forms (mean 96%, range
12–100%).
A total of 625 injuries (46%) and 327 illnesses (43%) were
missed by the NOCs and only recorded by the LOCOG medical
staff. Of the 174 severe injuries, meaning those with an esti-
mated absence for more than 7 days, almost three-quarters were
captured by the NOC (n=123, 71%), while 51 injuries (29%)
were reported solely through the medical encounters by the
LOCOG medical staff.
DISCUSSION
This paper analyses and discusses the risk of injuries and ill-
nesses among athletes competing in the London Olympic
Games. The main ﬁndings of this 17-day long investigation
were that 11% and 7% of all the 10 568 athletes suffered from
at least one injury or illness, with overall rates of 128.8 injuries
and 71.7 illnesses per 1000 athletes, respectively. The magni-
tude and characteristics of the injuries and illnesses varied sub-
stantially between sports and gender. While taekwondo,
football, BMX and handball had the highest rates of injury, the
highest rates of illness were found in beach volleyball, synchro-
nised swimming and football.
Injury incidences in the lympic sports
The injury incidences found across the sports in the London
Olympic Games are comparable to those reported earlier from
the Athens Olympic Games in 2004 (team sports only),4the
Olympic Games in Beijing in 2008,18as well as in certain major
elite single-sport events.12However, the London Games athletes
competing in archery or boxing experienced a 5% lower injury
rate than their counterparts from the Beijing Olympic Games.18
Conversely, a higher injury rate was found among the London
Games athletes competing in athletics (6%), badminton (11%),
diving (6%), fencing (7%), handball (5%), sailing (14%), syn-
chronised swimming (12%), taekwondo (12%), tennis (6%) and
triathlon (5%). Similarly, the overall injury rate in athletics was
4–8% higher than that previously reported from the athletics
W orld Championships from 2007 to 2012.13–15
A change in injury incidence can be the result of changes in
competition rules, in equipment or in other environmental
factors. Changes in injury rates can also follow an increased or
reduced awareness among both the athletes and their medical
staff in recognising and reporting even minor incidents (broad
injury and illness de ﬁnition applied in IOC surveillance studies).
In certain sports, changes may also be attributable to more com-
prehensive and accurate data reporting by team physicians who
over time have been trained as injury and illness recordersthrough the implementation of surveillance systems by their
own Federation. Also, rate differences (lower or higher) may
simply be the result of a natural ﬂuctuation/variability of athletes
exposure to risk, an observation that emphasises the value of
on-going surveillance to monitor trends over time, for example,
the effect of rule or equipment changes in the period between
major sports events.
Severity, location and type of injuries
In the Olympic Games even minor injuries and illnesses with no
or minimal time-loss can have serious consequences for the
athlete. An injury or illness of otherwise insigni ﬁcant severity
may prevent Olympic athletes from reaching their life-time
achievement. The majority (65%) of the injuries occurring in
the London Olympic Games were reported to be of minimal
severity, with no absence from competition or training. In con-
trast, 35% of all injuries were estimated to entail time-loss of at
least 1 day from training or competition, while 13% were esti-
mated to have more than 7 days time-loss. This indicates a
reduction in the number of time-loss injuries from the Beijing
Games, where half of the injuries were expected to prevent the
athlete from participating in competition or training.18
Furthermore, of the more severe injuries leading to an absence
of more than 7 days, 81% occurred during competition, sup-
porting earlier ﬁndings that the injury rate is higher in competi-
tion than in training.81 31 52 1In addition, it might indicate the
overall importance of Olympic competition over training; the
former for many athletes representing the culmination of their
perennial efforts, sacri ﬁces and preparation to ful ﬁl their ambi-
tions as Olympians.
The sports with the highest rate of injuries entailing a pro-
longed absence from training or competition (>7 days) were
taekwondo (6% of the athletes), handball (5%), BMX cycling
(4%) and weightlifting (4%). This corresponds with the data
from the Beijing Games.
The risk of concussion is a recurrent concern in certain
sports, and its diagnosis, prevention, treatment and
return-to-play guidelines have been addressed in recent consen-
sus meetings.22 23However, as in the Beijing Games (12 concus-
sions, 1.09 per 1000 registered athletes), the risk of sustaining a
concussion in the London Games was low (6 concussions, 0.57
per 1000 athletes). In contrast, 20 concussions (7.8 per 1000
participating athlete) were reported from the 2010 Vancouver
Winter Olympic Games, with every ﬁfth injury overall affecting
the head, neck and cervical spine.19Pending more data, this
may indicate that winter sports athletes, particularly those
exposed to high speed are at even higher risk of potentiallyTable 3 Response rates, injuries and illnesses in NOCs of different sizes (measured by number of athletes)

severe head injuries than their summer-sports counterparts,
including those competing in the martial arts.
Mechanisms and circumstances of injury
The mechanisms and circumstances of injuries in training and
competition differed signi ﬁcantly among the different sports.
Overall, the distribution of injuries across competition and train-
ing (55% vs 45%) was similar to that reported in the 2011
world championships in athletics,15but more proportionate
than those reported from the Beijing Games (74% vs 26%,
respectively) and from other single-sport events.81 3The major-
ity of injuries were reported to be acute, whereas overuse injur-
ies with either a gradual or sudden onset accounted for a
quarter of the injuries. Although a similar distribution was
reported from the Games in Beijing, these numbers should be
interpreted with caution, owing to the current limitations in the
recording of overuse injuries.24
Illness risk during the Olympics
The impact of an illness on an athlete ’s competition and training
can be just as signi ﬁcant as that of an injury . In recognition of
this, the IOC and other major International Sports Federations,
such as FIFA, FINA (Fédération Internationale de Natation) and
IAAF (International Association of Athletics Federations) have
extended their athlete health surveillance to also include
illnesses.
Interestingly, the rate of illness in the London Games was
identical to that of the Vancouver Winter Games, with 7 of 100
athletes being affected during the Games period. Similarly,
sport-speci ﬁc illness rates were comparable to those reported
previously in aquatics (7% in London vs 7% in recent cham-
pionships),12athletics (11% vs 7%)15and football (12% vs
12%).8Also consistent with the Vancouver data is the difference
in the incidence of illnesses between female and male athletes,
with women experiencing an illness incidence 60% higher than
men. The same disproportion has previously been reported in
the 2009 athletics13and aquatics12world championships, but
not in the 2011 athletics world championships15or during the
1994 –2009 US Open tennis championships.25
The high incidence of respiratory infections mirrors data
from other elite sport events.81 21 31 52 5Predominant risk
factors are mechanical and dehydration stresses generated
within the airways and the level of airborne pollutants, irritants
and allergens inhaled by the athlete under high ventilatory exer-
cise conditions.26It has earlier been reported that airway hyper-
responsiveness/asthma is the most common chronic medical
condition experienced by both summer and winter Olympic
athletes.27
Methodological considerations
In studies on sports injury , it is usually recommended to express
incidences using time exposed to risk as the denominator.20 28
However, given the inherent complexity of the Olympic Games,
this was rendered not feasible in the present study. Instead we
expressed the incidence of injury or illnesses as the number of
new cases per 1000 athlete participants. Although this is the
recommended approach in multisport events such as the
Olympic Games,17it ignores the fact that a multisport event is
comprised of different frequencies and lengths of competition
for each sport. For example, an Olympic diver ’s exposure to
competition and training —and the encompassing risk of injury
or illness —is by nature different to that of a sailor, weightlifter
or footballer. Although interpretation of differences in injury
incidence or pattern therefore should be made with somecaution, our reported incidences do indicate athletes ’actual risk
of suffering injuries or illnesses in their respective sport.
We d eﬁned injuries and illnesses as new or recurring injuries
or illnesses receiving medical attention, regardless of the conse-
quences with respect to absence from competition or training.
By using such a de ﬁnition, predominantly the moderate and
severe acute injuries will be recorded. The less-serious injuries
may be overlooked, since such injuries do not always require
medical attention,29 30albeit our results show that the majority
of reported injuries were not estimated to entail any absence
from the sport. In the Olympic Games, all athletes can get
healthcare through the athletes ’village polyclinic and the venue
medical clinics. However, the availability, size and quality of the
NOCs own medical teams vary between countries, meaning that
not all athletes bene ﬁt from the same easy access to healthcare,
which may bias the injury and illness recording. Nonetheless,
we believe that our collection of data through both the NOCs
and LOCOG physicians, we captured most injuries and illnesses.
Throughout the 17 days of data collection in the Olympic
Games, we collected 96% of all the NOC injury and illness
report forms. This is the highest NOC response rate to date in
the Olympic Games injury and illness surveillance, a result
which can be attributed to favourably disposed NOC medical
staff, an informational meeting with all NOCs the day before
the Games ’opening, the preparation of report forms in eight
languages and an instructional booklet on how to ﬁll in the
forms, and a dedicated research team which conducted frequent
follow-up visits to boost NOCs ’compliance. However, although
the NOC response rate was very high, we did not test the accur-
acy and internal validity of their reported data. Thus, we cannot
know the extent to which the NOC data match the actual cir-
cumstances of the occurred injury or illness. An indication of
this is that a number of injuries and illnesses were recorded in
an incomplete manner with missing information in categories
such as type, location and diagnosis. Furthermore, it has been
documented previously in professional alpine skiing16and male
elite football31that prospective injury surveillance by team
medical staff underestimates the incidence of injuries and time-
loss injuries. Our results support these ﬁndings; compared with
the medical staff working at the polyclinic and medical venues,
the NOC medical teams did not report 46% of the injuries,
29% of the time-loss injuries and 43% of the illnesses. With
respect to the more severe injuries the results were somewhat
better; of the 174 injuries with an estimated absence of more
than 7 days, almost three-quarters were captured by the NOCs.
Retrospective athlete interviews at the end of the event have
been suggested as one option to improve the surveillance data
quality15; however, this seems impractical in major events com-
prising thousands of athletes, such as the Olympic Games.
Recent papers from Bahr24and Clarsen et al32 33highlight
the inadequacy of the current standard epidemiological method-
ology to record the true magnitude and pattern of overuse injur-
ies in sport. As pointed out by Bahr,24overuse injuries may in
many sports represent as much of a problem as do acute injur-
ies, but these injuries are seldom properly captured or registered
in statistics through current recording methods, as athletes with
overuse problems often do not seek medical attention or lose
time from training or competition. In the present study, overuse
was reported to be the mechanism for every fourth injury,
notably in diving, athletics, weightlifting, swimming and
fencing. Furthermore, 68% of the overuse injuries in London
were recorded with no estimated absence, an indication that —
also in the Olympic setting —athletes with overuse problems
often continue to train and compete, although typically with

signiﬁcant inhibitions, such as pain, restricted function and
reduced performance.
Practical implications
The continuous surveillance of injury and illness rates is a fun-
damental pre-requisite to athlete health protection. Only by
monitoring the development over several years can we identify
and follow changes in potential risk factors and mechanisms of
injury and illnesses in the different sports and their disciplines,
which, in turn, will allow us to develop, introduce and update
targeted preventive measures. The key to a successful study of
epidemiology lies in a well-organised data-collection procedure
with coordinated efforts from sports medicine professionals,
coaches and athletes, combined with systematic subsequent
analyses.
However, surveillance of injuries and illnesses for elite ath-
letes during multisport events such as the Olympic Games is
subject to other challenges than surveillance systems in other
contexts, such as single sport or amateur events. Differences
encompass: the limited data-collection window; the great
amount of data to be recorded and processed very quickly; the
vast array of people —with different professional backgrounds —
involved in the same data-recording process; the high number
of different speci ﬁc settings in which the injuries occur (eg,
canoeing vs tennis vs taekwondo); the low level of severe health
incidents, with most being minor-to-moderate musculoskeletal
conditions and the intense media and public scrutiny of injuries
and illnesses when the athletes fail to meet their performance
goals.34The IOC injury and illness surveillance system has been
continuously improved to best tackle these unique conditions,
and we aim to continue to further re ﬁne its processes.
For example, a long-term goal of the IOC is to develop a cus-
tomised electronic health record (EHR) that (1) can be used by
NOCs on both a general year round basis in the clinic to record
and follow athletes ’health/injury, employing periodic health
evaluations (PHE) recommendations,35and in the lead up to
and during the Olympic Games; (2) can be used at the Olympic
Games ’polyclinics and venue medical centres to have an imme-
diate medical history of the athlete, which can be taken into
consideration to optimise the treatment of injuries and illnesses
during the Olympic Games and (3) will provide the IOC and
other users with longitudinal de-identi ﬁed individual and aggre-
gate data allowing the IOC to survey and assess the epidemi-
ology, identify injury and illness risk factors and mechanisms,
and in turn, introduce tailored measures to prevent injuries and
illnesses in athletes in all sports. W e believe that instituting an
EHR in the Olympic Movement can have a tremendous impact
on athletes ’health protection. Furthermore, it would also
remedy the current recording problem of overuse injuries. By
adopting the recommendations of Bahr24and Clarsen et al32 33
the EHR would facilitate the prospective serial measurement
and recording of athlete health and symptoms of pathology ,
using sensitive scoring instruments for pain and other overuse
symptoms, and open up for reporting of both the incidence and
prevalence of injuries.
The continuously accumulating evidence that injury and
illness rates vary substantially between sports demonstrates the
need for tailoring preventive measures to the speci ﬁc context of
each sport. Sport bodies such as the IOC, IFs and NOCs have a
great responsibility to protect the health of their athletes. The
Olympic Movement Medical Code encourages all stakeholders
to take measures to ensure that sport is practised without
danger to the health of the athletes and to minimise the risks of
physical injury and psychological harm. For NOCs one evidentway of achieving this is by introducing PHEs in their daily prac-
tice, which are instrumental in preventing injuries and illnesses,
and hence, to protect the health of the athletes. For IFs, a crit-
ical component of this responsibility is the institution of a scien-
tiﬁcally sound injury and illness surveillance system in all major
events. Some sports federations, such as FIFA, FINA, FIS
(Fédération Internationale de Ski), FIVB (Fédération
Internationale de Volleyball), IAAF and UEFA (Union of
European Football Associations) have put increasing efforts into
working systematically and scienti ﬁcally to protect their athletes ’
health. W e encourage other IFs and sports organisations to
follow their example.
CONCLUSION
Eleven per cent of the athletes incurred an injury during the
London Olympic Games, and 7% suffered from at least one
illness. The incidences and characteristics of injuries and ill-
nesses during training and competition varied substantially
between sports and gender. Future initiatives should include
the development of preventive measures tailored for each
speciﬁc sport and the continued focus among sport bodies
to institute and further develop scienti ﬁc injury and illness
surveillance systems.
