U.S. Department of Health and Human Services
Centers for Disease Control and PreventionHealthy and Safe Swimming 
Week — May 20–26, 2019
This year’s Healthy and Safe Swimming Week theme, “Pool 
Chemistry for Healthy and Safe Swimming,” focuses on prevent -
ing pool chemical injuries. Pool chemicals prevent the spread of 
germs that cause illnesses and disease outbreaks; however, these 
same chemicals can cause injuries if mishandled. Each year, an 
estimated 3,000–5,000 emergency department visits caused by 
pool chemical injuries (e.g., poisonings from inhalation or inges -
tion of pool chemicals and dermatitis or conjunctivitis from pool 
chemical splashes) occur in the United States.
This issue of MMWR  includes a report focusing on pool 
chemical injuries leading to U.S. emergency department 
visits during 2008–2017 and a 2018 toxic chlorine gas inci -
dent in New York ( 1). Following product label directions, 
wearing proper safety equipment (e.g., respirator or goggles) 
when handling chemicals, and keeping chemicals out of the 
reach of children and teens can help prevent these injuries.
CDC’s Model Aquatic Health Code (MAHC; https://
www.cdc.gov/mahc ) is a set of recommendations that can 
be voluntarily adopted by state and local jurisdictions to 
help prevent pool chemical injuries, disease outbreaks, and 
drowning associated with public treated recreational water 
venues (e.g., pools, hot tubs/spas, and water playgrounds 
at hotels and apartment complexes). Swimmers can help 
by showering before getting in the water, never urinating 
or defecating in the water, and taking young children on 
bathroom breaks or checking their diapers every hour.
CDC updates the MAHC every 3 years in coordination 
with the Council for the MAHC ( https://www.cmahc.
org/). CDC encourages public health officials to submit 
MAHC change requests to CMAHC by January 6, 2020, 
(https://www.cmahc.org/enter-change-request.php ) to be 
considered for the 2021 MAHC (4th edition).

Pool chemicals are added to water in treated recreational 
water venues (e.g., pools, hot tubs/spas, and water play -
grounds) primarily to protect public health. Pool chemicals 
inactivate pathogens (e.g., chlorine or bromine), optimize 
pH (e.g., muriatic acid), and increase water clarity, which 
helps prevent drowning by enabling detection of distressed 
swimmers underwater. However, pool chemicals can cause 
injuries if mishandled. To estimate the annual number of 
U.S. emergency department (ED) visits for pool chemical 
injuries, CDC analyzed 2008–2017 data from the National 
Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS), operated by 
the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). 
During 2015–2017, pool chemical injuries led to an estimated 
13,508 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 9,087–17,929) U.S.

Morgan Bobb Swanson, BSED visits; 36.4% (estimated 4,917 [95% CI = 3,022–6,811]) 
of patients were aged <18 years. At least 56.3% (estimated 
7,601 [95% CI = 4,587–10,615]) of injuries occurred at a 
residence. T wo thirds of the injuries occurred during the period 
from Memorial Day weekend through Labor Day. This report 
also describes a toxic chlorine gas incident that occurred at a 
public pool in New York in 2018. Pool chemical injuries are 
preventable. CDC’s Model Aquatic Health Code (MAHC) is 
an important resource that operators of public treated recre -
ational water venues (e.g., at hotels, apartment complexes, and 
waterparks) can use to prevent pool chemical injuries.
NEISS captures data on ED visits for injuries, including 
those associated with consumer products. NEISS records 
include data on consumer products (swimming pool chemical 
product code = 938); patient age, sex, and race/ethnicity; the 
most severe diagnosis; the most seriously injured body part; 
patient disposition; incident location; and two 71-character 
narrative fields to describe the incident leading to injury. These 
data are collected from a nationally representative probabil -
ity sample of approximately 100 hospitals across the United 
States, and thus, can be used to calculate national estimates. 
Each case was weighted based on the inverse probability of 
hospital selection, and the weights were summed to produce 
national estimates; 95% CIs were calculated according to 
CPSC’s direct variance method, accounting for the complex 
sampling design ( 1). Rates per 100,000 population were 
calculated using weighted NEISS point estimates and U.S. 
Census Bureau population estimates ( 2). Descriptive analyses of 2015–2017 data were conducted to characterize the most 
recent pool chemical injuries and increase national estimate 
stability. Data analyses were conducted using SAS (version 
9.4; SAS Institute).
During 2008–2017, the median estimated annual num -
ber of U.S. ED visits for pool chemical injuries was 4,535 
(range  =  3,151–5,215) (Figure). During 2015–2017, pool 
chemical injuries led to an estimated 13,508 total ED visits 
(95% CI = 9,087–17,929; rate = 1.4 per 100,000 population) 
(Table), with persons aged <18 years accounting for 36.4% 
of patients (estimated 4,917 [95% CI = 3,022–6,811]). 
An estimated 93.9% (95% CI = 8,480–16,899) of patients 
seeking care in an ED for pool chemical injuries were either 
treated in the ED and released or examined in the ED and 
released without treatment. An estimated 5,245 patients 
(95% CI = 3,135–7,355; rate 0.5 per 100,000 population) had 
their injury diagnosed as poisoning. NEISS report narratives 
indicated that approximately 90% of patients who received a 
diagnosis of poisoning were injured via inhalation rather than 
ingestion. The poisoning diagnosis contributed to “all parts of 
the body (>50% of the body)”* being the most affected body 
part. An estimated 3,745 injuries (95% CI = 2,497–4,994) 
were diagnosed as dermatitis or conjunctivitis, and an estimated 
2,588 (95% CI = 644–4,533]) were diagnosed as chemical 
burn. No deaths were documented. At least 56.3% (estimated

coded as “all parts of the body (>50% of the body).”

location data were captured, 83.8% (7,601 [95% CI = 4,587–
10,615]) occurred at a residence. Approximately two thirds 
(64.5%) of all ED visits occurred during the summer swim 
season (Saturday of Memorial Day weekend [late May] through 
Labor Day [first Monday in September]). Narratives for NEISS 
reports noted that patients were most frequently injured when 
inhaling chemical fumes or dust (particularly while opening 
containers), when pool chemicals were not secured away from 
children, or when pool chemicals were added to the water just 
before the patient entered the water.
New York mandates operators of public treated recreational 
water venues to report onsite illness or injury incidents† to per -
mitting officials within 24 hours of occurrence ( https://www.
health.ny.gov/regulations/nycrr/title_10/part_6/subpart_6-1.
htm). In August 2018, maintenance personnel at an outdoor 
pool in upstate New York noticed a yellow substance seeping 
into the pool through the inlets (e.g., water jets). Lifeguards 
cleared the pool of swimmers, and the maintenance person -
nel examined the equipment room. There they discovered 
that the recirculation pump was not running, resulting in no 
water flow in the recirculation system.§ The operator turned 
the pump back on, which resulted in resumption of water 
flow in the recirculation system. Consequently, substantially 
more of the yellow substance entered the pool; a pungent odor 
† This includes incidents that result in death, require resuscitation, or require 
referral to a hospital or other facility for medical attention or where illness is 
associated with bathing water quality.
§ The recirculation system transports water from a treated recreational water 
venue via outlets (e.g., the main drain). Via the venue plumbing, the water 
passes through the filter. Subsequently, chemical feeders add chlorine or bromine 
and further along in the plumbing, a pH-adjusting chemical (e.g., muriatic 
acid). This means chemical dilution occurs before mixing. Finally, the 
recirculation system returns treated water into the venue via inlets.developed; and lifeguards evacuated the pool area. Investigation 
of the event suggested that a power outage in the area the 
previous night could have shut down the recirculation pump; 
however, the water flow monitoring system, which deactivates 
the chemical feeders when there is no water flow, failed. The 
failure to automatically shut off the chemical feeders allowed 
concentrated chlorine and acid to mix, and thus, generated 
toxic chlorine gas in the recirculation system. Persons in the 
pool area reported blisters, nausea, vomiting, or irritation of the 
face or eyes, and a few followed up with a health care provider.
Discussion
Maximizing the health benefits of water-based physical activ -
ity (3) includes minimizing the risk for pool chemical injuries 
(4–8) and transmission of pathogens ( 9). The magnitude of 
U.S. ED visits for pool chemical injuries, the disproportion -
ate impact on children, and the incidence of these injuries at 
residences all call for increased awareness about pool chemi -
cal safety among operators of public venues and owners of 
residential venues.
Recommendations to minimize risk for illness and injury 
associated with public treated recreational water venues can 
be found in the MAHC ( https://www.cdc.gov/mahc ). The 
MAHC is based on the latest science or best practices and can 
be adopted voluntarily, in part or whole, by state and local 
jurisdictions. For example, the MAHC recommends including 
pool chemical safety in training for operators of public pools, 
hot tubs/spas, and water playgrounds (MAHC 6.1.2.1.4.6¶), 
covering topics such as how to read product labels. Labels 
include information on what chemicals are incompatible (e.g., 
chlorine and acid) and which personal protective equipment 
to use. The MAHC also recommends automatic deactivation 
of chemical feeders in the event of no or low water flow in the 
recirculation system (MAHC 4.7.3.2.1.3). In the upstate New 
York incident, the water flow monitoring system installed to do 
this (as mandated by the state code) failed. The pool remained 
closed for the duration of the 2018 summer swim season, and 
the flow indicator was replaced. In coordination with the New 
York State Department of Health, new policies and procedures 
will be implemented at the venue in the 2019 season, including 
performing a check of the recirculation system, testing pool 
water chemistry, and documenting findings every 2 hours while 
the pool is open to swimmers. The next edition of the MAHC 
is scheduled for update and release in 2021. CDC asks state 
and local public health officials, who are on the frontline of 
investigating and preventing recreational water–associated ill -
ness and injury, to take an active role in the MAHC updating

The findings in this report are subject to at least five limita -
tions. First, although NEISS data provide a snapshot of pool 
chemical injuries leading to ED visits, they do not characterize 
the epidemiology of pool chemical injuries that do not result 
in an ED visit. Second, understanding of pool chemical inju -
ries is limited by minimal data (e.g., restricted text fields that preclude detailed description of incidents leading to injury) and 
missing data (e.g., incident location). Third, because NEISS 
collects data on only the most severe diagnosis, some pool 
chemical injuries might have been missed. Fourth, in some 
injury reports, the injury-causing chemical could have been 
incorrectly identified. For example, the disinfection byproduct, 
chloramine (chlorine combined with nitrogenous compounds 
such as those found in urine, feces, sweat, and dirt) might have 
been the cause of ocular irritation rather than chlorine itself 
as was reported. Finally, water chemistry can change quickly, 
making it difficult to determine the etiology of and factors 
contributing to pool chemical injuries.
Morbidity and Mortality Weekly ReportMMWR / May 17, 2019 / Vol. 68 / No. 19 437
US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and PreventionSummary
What is already known about this topic?
Pool chemicals are added to water in treated recreational water 
venues (e.g., pools, hot tubs/spas, and water playgrounds) to 
prevent illnesses and outbreaks; these same chemicals can 
cause injuries if mishandled.
What is added by this report?
During 2015–2017, pool chemical injuries led to an estimated 
13,508 U.S. emergency department visits, approximately one 
third of which occurred in persons aged <18 years. Most injuries 
occurred at a residence, and two thirds occurred during the 
summer swimming season (Memorial Day weekend through 
Labor Day).
What are the implications for public health practice?
Pool chemical injuries are preventable. CDC’s Model Aquatic 
Health Code ( https://www.cdc.gov/mahc ), based on the latest 
science or best practices, is an important resource to prevent 
pool chemical injuries.
State and local jurisdiction over residential treated recreational 
water venues is limited compared with jurisdiction over public 
venues. However, to help prevent pool chemical injuries in the 
residential setting, state and local environmental health practitio -
ners can be a resource for residential pool or hot tub/spa owners 
by offering them pool chemical safety training. Pool chemical 
safety recommendations ( https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/
swimming/aquatics-professionals/preventing-pool-chemical-
events.html ) are generally the same for residential and public 
venues (Box). Swimmers and parents of young swimmers should 
understand basic water chemistry and how they can help opti -
mize it before getting into a pool, hot tub/spa, or water play -
ground. To help prevent the formation of chloramines, which 
cause ocular and respiratory irritation and consume chlorine that 
would otherwise be available to inactivate pathogens, swimmers 
should take a rinse shower before getting in the water, not urinate 
or defecate in the water, and take children on bathroom breaks 
or check diapers every hour. These steps help limit the amount 
of nitrogen compounds being introduced into the water. Healthy 
and Safe Swimming Week (the week before Memorial Day) is 
an ideal time to disseminate these messages.

Before using pool chemicals 
• Get trained in pool chemical safety (for example, 
during operator training course)
• Ask for help if you are not trained for specific tasks
• Read entire product label or safety data sheet (SDS) 
before using
• Learn your pool’s Emergency Chemical Spill Response 
Plan and practice steps (e.g., evacuation)
Using pool chemicals safely
• Dress for safety by wearing appropriate safety 
equipment (e.g., safety goggles, gloves, and mask)
• Read chemical product label before each use
 –Handle in a well-ventilated area
 –Open one product container at a time and close it 
before opening another
 –Minimize dust, fumes, and splashes
 –Measure carefully
 –Never mix chlorine products with acid; this could 
create toxic gases
 –Never mix different pool chemicals (e.g., different 
types of chlorine products) with each other or with 
any other substance
• Only predissolve pool chemicals when directed by 
product label
 –If product label directs predissolving, add pool 
chemical to water; never add water to pool 
chemical because violent (potentially explosive) 
reaction can occur

The 2005 CDC guidelines for preventing Mycobacterium 
tuberculosis  transmission in health care settings include rec -
ommendations for baseline tuberculosis (TB) screening of all 
U.S. health care personnel and annual testing for health care 
personnel working in medium-risk settings or settings with 
potential for ongoing transmission ( 1). Using evidence from 
a systematic review conducted by a National T uberculosis 
Controllers Association (NTCA)-CDC work group, and 
following methods adapted from the Guide to Community 
Preventive Services ( 2,3), the 2005 CDC recommendations 
for testing U.S. health care personnel have been updated and 
now include 1) TB screening with an individual risk assessment 
and symptom evaluation at baseline (preplacement); 2) TB 
testing with an interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) or a 
tuberculin skin test (TST) for persons without documented 
prior TB disease or latent TB infection (LTBI); 3) no routine 
serial TB testing at any interval after baseline in the absence 
of a known exposure or ongoing transmission; 4) encourage -
ment of treatment for all health care personnel with untreated 
LTBI, unless treatment is contraindicated; 5) annual symptom 
screening for health care personnel with untreated LTBI; and 
6) annual TB education of all health care personnel.
Background
Historically, U.S. health care personnel were at increased risk 
for LTBI and TB disease from occupational exposures; how -
ever, recent data suggest that this might no longer be the case. 
TB rates in the United States have declined substantially; the 
annual national TB rate in 2017 (2.8 per 100,000 population) 
represents a 73% decrease from the rate in 1991 (10.4) and a 
42% decrease from the rate in 2005 (4.8) ( 4,5). Surveillance 
data reported to CDC during 1995–2007 revealed that TB 
incidence rates among health care personnel were similar to 
those in the general population ( 6), raising questions about the 
cost-effectiveness of routine serial occupational testing ( 7). In 
addition, a recent retrospective cohort study of approximately 
40,000 health care personnel at a tertiary U.S. medical center 
in a low TB-incidence state found an extremely low rate of TST 
conversion (0.3%) during 1998–2014, with a limited propor -
tion attributable to occupational exposure ( 8). Moreover, IGRAs and TSTs have well-documented limitations for serial testing of 
health care personnel at low risk for LTBI and TB disease ( 9,10).
Methods
In 2015, an NTCA-CDC work group comprising experts in 
TB, infection control, and occupational health was formed to 
discuss potential updates to recommendations for health care 
personnel TB screening and testing. The work group included 
representation from CDC, state and local public health depart -
ments, academia, and occupational health associations. During 
2015–2016, the work group met periodically to discuss where 
updates were needed to the 2005 CDC recommendations and 
to establish a plan for the review of evidence. In January 2017, 
the work group commenced a systematic literature review of 
the screening and testing of health care personnel for TB and 
discussed the findings during a web conference in September 
2017. Updated recommendations were developed by the work 
group during a web conference in December 2017.
Systematic review methods and findings.  A systematic 
review of evidence published after release of the 2005 guide -
lines was conducted using methodology developed for the 
Guide to Community Preventive Services ( 2,3). The search 
included articles indexed in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and 
Scopus. The medical subject headings used for the search were 
“latent tuberculosis” and “tuberculosis”; search terms included 
“healthcare worker,” “healthcare personnel,” “health worker,” 
“occupational exposure,” and “occupational diseases.” English 
language articles were included that 1) were published during 
January 2006–November 2017; 2) described TB screening 
and testing in low-incidence ( 11), high-income countries ( 12); 
3) employed study designs that were randomized controlled tri -
als, prospective cohort, retrospective cohort, or cross-sectional 
studies; and 4) reported LTBI prevalence, test conversion or 
reversion, or TB transmission rates. Each study was indepen -
dently abstracted and assessed for suitability of study design 
by two reviewers using a data abstraction form adapted from 
the Guide to Community Preventive Services ( 3).
This search identified 1,147 citations, of which 39 studies 
focused on TB screening and testing among health care per -
sonnel; three studies (one that was an economic evaluation, 
one that focused only on test performance, and one of limited 
Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 440 MMWR / May 17, 2019 / Vol. 68 / No. 19
US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Preventionexecution quality) were excluded, leaving 36 studies in the 
analysis (Supplementary Box, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/
cdc/77668 ). Sixteen (44%) of these had been conducted in the 
United States, with the remaining studies from Australia (one), 
Europe (17), Israel (one), and New Zealand (one). Thirty-four 
(94%) studies had been conducted in a hospital setting; most 
used either a retrospective cohort or cross-sectional design (14). 
Substantial unexplained heterogeneity existed for all outcomes 
examined, even when stratified by location or study design. 
An examination of the patterns of results did not indicate 
publication bias.
Five U.S. studies reported prior bacillus Calmette-Guérin 
vaccination by health care personnel (median percentage = 7%; 
range = 2.3%–93%). Eight of the 16 U.S. studies reported two-
step TST testing at baseline. The remaining studies reported 
IGRA (six) or a combination of IGRA and TST (two) at base -
line. Findings from the metaanalyses indicated that 5% and 
3% of U.S. health care personnel tested positive at baseline by 
IGRA and TST, respectively, and that 4% and 0.7% converted 
from a negative to a positive during serial testing by IGRA and 
TST, respectively. Among U.S. health care personnel who had 
a baseline positive test and were retested by the same method 
during serial testing, the second test was negative in 48% of 
cases by IGRA and 62% by TST. No U.S. studies were found 
that evaluated the clinical implications of these discordant 
results. Among 63,975 U.S. health care personnel from eight 
studies reporting disease occurrence, none experienced TB 
disease. Based on expert opinion from the NTCA-CDC work 
group and findings from the systematic review indicating that 
a limited proportion of health care personnel test positive at 
baseline and convert during serial testing, recommendations 
were drafted for presentation to the Advisory Council on 
the Elimination of T uberculosis (ACET) and the Healthcare 
Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (HICPAC).
Expert consultation results.  The draft NTCA-CDC 
recommendations were presented publicly at the April 2018 
ACET meeting ( 13) and the May 2018 HICPAC meeting 
(14). Members of ACET and HICPAC were asked to provide 
feedback to CDC regarding the recommendations and their 
accuracy, practicability, clarity, and usefulness. Commenters 
during the ACET meeting noted that the recommendation 
encouraging treatment of health care personnel with LTBI 
could potentially generate cost savings and play an important 
role in the elimination of active TB disease in the United States. 
Commenters during the HICPAC meeting were supportive 
of the need to reduce TB testing for health care personnel; 
questions were raised about the evidence for, and feasibility 
of, implementing some of the proposed changes. Commenters 
during both meetings also encouraged the work group’s plan 
for a supplemental document to aid health care facilities in implementing the updated recommendations. In addition, the 
recommendations were presented by NTCA at the National 
T uberculosis Conference in May 2018 ( 15) for comment 
and feedback. Conference attendees supported the need for 
updated guidelines and the content of the recommendations 
that were presented.
In July 2018, the NTCA-CDC work group held another 
web conference to address feedback received from the ACET, 
HICPAC, and National T uberculosis Conference meetings 
and finalized the updated recommendations. The work group 
requested that NTCA convene a new work group to develop 
the supplemental implementation guidance document sup -
ported by ACET and HICPAC. The supplemental document 
is expected to be completed by NTCA in 2019.
Updated Recommendations
Recommendations from the 2005 CDC guidelines that 
are outside the scope of health care personnel screening, test -
ing, treatment, and education remain unchanged (Table); 
this includes continuing facility risk assessments for guiding 
infection control policies and procedures. Here, TB screen -
ing is defined as a process that includes a TB  risk assessment, 
symptom evaluation, TB testing for M. tuberculosis  infection 
(by either IGRA or TST) for health care personnel without 
documented evidence of prior LTBI or TB disease, and addi -
tional workup for TB disease for health care personnel with 
positive test results or symptoms compatible with TB disease. 
This update does not include recommendations for using an 
IGRA versus a TST for diagnosing LTBI, which have been 
published elsewhere ( 16).
Baseline (preplacement) screening and testing.  All U.S. 
health care personnel should have baseline TB screening, 
including an individual risk assessment (Box), which is neces -
sary for interpreting any test result. The 2005 guidelines state 
that baseline test results provide a basis for comparison in the 
event of a potential or known exposure to M. tuberculosis , 
facilitate detection and treatment of LTBI or TB disease in 
health care personnel before placement, and reduce the risk to 
patients and other health care personnel ( 1). The risk assess -
ment and symptom evaluation help guide decisions when 
interpreting test results. For example, health care personnel 
with a positive test who are asymptomatic, unlikely to be 
infected with M. tuberculosis , and at low risk for progression 
on the basis of their risk assessment should have a second 
test (either an IGRA or a TST) as recommended in the 2017 
TB diagnostic guidelines of the American Thoracic Society, 
Infectious Diseases Society of America, and CDC ( 16). In 
this example, the health care personnel should be considered 
infected with M. tuberculosis  only if both the first and second 
tests are positive.

† All other aspects of the Guidelines for Preventing the Transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis  in Health-Care Settings, 2005 remain in effect, including facility 
risk assessments to help guide infection control policies and procedures.
Postexposure screening and testing.  After known exposure 
to a person with potentially infectious TB disease without use 
of adequate personal protection, health care personnel should 
have a timely symptom evaluation and additional testing, if 
indicated. Those without documented evidence of prior LTBI 
or TB disease should have an IGRA or a TST performed. 
Health care personnel with documented prior LTBI or TB 
disease do not need another test for infection after exposure. 
These persons should have further evaluation if a concern for 
TB disease exists. Those with an initial negative test should 
be retested 8–10 weeks after the last exposure, preferably by 
using the same test type as was used for the prior negative test.
Serial screening and testing for health care personnel 
without LTBI.  In the absence of known exposure or evidence 
of ongoing TB transmission, U.S. health care personnel (as 
identified in the 2005 guidelines) without LTBI should not 
undergo routine serial TB screening or testing at any interval 
after baseline (e.g., annually). Health care facilities might 
consider using serial TB screening of certain groups who 
might be at increased occupational risk for TB exposure (e.g., 
pulmonologists or respiratory therapists) or in certain settings 
if transmission has occurred in the past (e.g., emergency depart -
ments). Such determinations should be individualized on the 
basis of factors that might include the number of patients with 
infectious pulmonary TB who are examined in these areas, 
whether delays in initiating airborne isolation occurred, or 
whether prior annual testing has revealed ongoing transmis -
sion. Consultation with the local or state health department 
is encouraged to assist in making these decisions.

Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 442 MMWR / May 17, 2019 / Vol. 68 / No. 19
US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and PreventionSummary
What is already known about this topic?
Since 1991, U.S. tuberculosis (TB) rates have declined, including 
among health care personnel (HCP). Serial TB testing has 
limitations in populations at low risk.
What is added by this report?
A systematic review found a low percentage of HCP have a 
positive TB test at baseline and upon serial testing. Updated 
recommendations for screening and testing HCP include an 
individual baseline (preplacement) risk assessment, symptom 
evaluation and testing of persons without prior TB or latent TB 
infection (LTBI), no routine serial testing in the absence of 
exposure or ongoing transmission, treatment for HCP diag -
nosed with LTBI, annual symptom screening for persons with 
untreated LTBI, and annual TB education of all HCP .
What are the implications for public health practice?
Increasing LTBI treatment among HCP might further decrease 
TB transmission in health care settings.
have risks for TB progression after baseline testing that necessi -
tate special consideration. If these risks are unrecognized, these 
health care personnel might experience TB disease and transmit 
TB to patients, coworkers, or other contacts. Therefore, health 
care facilities should educate all health care personnel annually 
about TB, including risk factors, signs, and symptoms; facili -
ties also should encourage health care personnel to discuss any 
potential occupational or nonoccupational TB exposure with 
their primary care provider and occupational health clinician. 
The decision to perform TB testing after baseline should be 
based on the person’s risk for TB exposure at work or elsewhere 
since that person’s last test.
Evaluation and treatment of health care personnel with 
positive test results.  Health care personnel with a newly posi -
tive test result (with confirmation for those persons at low risk 
as described previously) should undergo a symptom evalua -
tion and chest radiograph to assess for TB disease. Additional 
workup might be indicated on the basis of those results. Health 
care personnel with a prior positive TB test and documented 
normal chest radiograph do not require a repeat radiograph 
unless they are symptomatic or starting LTBI treatment ( 16). 
The local public health department should be notified imme -
diately if TB disease is suspected.
Health care personnel with LTBI and no prior treatment 
should be offered, and strongly encouraged to complete, treat -
ment with a recommended regimen, including short-course 
treatments, unless a contraindication exists ( 17,18). Health 
care personnel who do not complete LTBI treatment should 
be monitored with annual symptom evaluation to detect early 
evidence of TB disease and to reevaluate the risks and benefits 
of LTBI treatment. These health care personnel also should be educated about the signs and symptoms of TB disease that 
should prompt an immediate evaluation between screenings.
Health care facilities should aim to identify LTBI among 
health care personnel and encourage LTBI treatment. Health 
care facilities are urged to collaborate with public health agen -
cies to assist in achieving this goal. Public health agencies can 
serve as a source for technical assistance, medical consultation 
regarding diagnosis and treatment of LTBI, and clarification 
of state or local regulations, surveillance requirements, and 
guidelines. Sharing information and experiences with public 
health agencies is necessary for understanding the impact of 
these recommendations on the overall incidence of TB and 
LTBI in the United States and the need to revise future recom -
mendations for health care personnel.

On October 1, 2018, the Rockland County (New York) 
Department of Health (RCDOH) alerted the New York State 
Department of Health (NYSDOH) of an unvaccinated teen -
aged traveler with diagnosed measles. During the next 17 days, 
RCDOH learned of an additional six unvaccinated travelers 
with measles. On October 24, 2018, the Ocean County (New 
Jersey) Health Department alerted the New Jersey Department of 
Health (NJDOH) of a case of measles in an international traveler, 
with rash onset October 17. The unvaccinated travelers reported 
recent travel in Israel, where an outbreak of approximately 3,150 
cases of measles is ongoing ( 1). Investigations during October 1, 
2018–April 30, 2019, identified 242 laboratory-confirmed and 
epidemiologically linked measles cases in New York, excluding 
New York City, and during October 17, 2018–November 30, 
2018, identified 33 in New Jersey (Figure). The cases of measles 
were primarily in members of orthodox Jewish communities.
New York
The 242 cases in New York (excluding New York City) 
included 206 in Rockland County and 36 in nearby counties. 
Most patients resided in orthodox Jewish neighborhoods with 
low school immunization rates. The median patient age was 
5 years (range = 0 days* to 63 years). The 2017–2018 New York 
State School Immunization Survey measles vaccination rate for 
students in prekindergarten through grade 12 was 98%; however, 
documented measles vaccination coverage in schools in the out -
break area was only 77%. To prevent disease spread in schools, 
Rockland County and neighboring Orange County have excluded 
unvaccinated students from school for 21 days after a measles 
exposure. To further control spread after school exposures, in areas 
of Rockland County with measles cases, exclusions from school 
were expanded to include all nonimmune students at schools that

doses of measles-mumps-rubella vaccine (MMR) or serologic 
evidence of immunity. To provide opportunities for vaccination, 
approximately 20 community vaccination events open to all ages 
were held in Rockland County and two in Orange County.
During October 1, 2018–April 30, 2019, Rockland County 
administered 19,661 MMR doses. NYSDOH, RCDOH, and 
private medical providers held nine informational events and 
distributed educational materials focused on measles prevention 
to 45,000 homes. A culturally appropriate and detailed vaccine 
education book was distributed to 15,000 Rockland County 
and 10,000 Orange County homes and medical providers. 
Orthodox Jewish leaders were engaged in the outbreak response, 
with rabbinical leaders supporting vaccination efforts and com -
munity groups advocating for vaccination. As of April 30, 2019, 
transmission was ongoing. This has been the largest measles 
outbreak in New York (outside New York City) since 1992 and, 
at 7 months, the longest documented outbreak in the United 
States since endemic measles was eliminated in 2000 ( 2).
New Jersey
During October 17–November 30, 2018, 33 measles cases 
were confirmed in New Jersey, primarily in members of the 
orthodox Jewish community in Ocean County. The median 
patient age was 10 years (range = 6 months–59 years). In Ocean 
County, unvaccinated students were excluded from school 
for 21 days after a measles exposure. Some private schools 
excluded unvaccinated students for the duration of the New 
Jersey outbreak. NJDOH worked with local health officials and 
providers to facilitate delivery of >12,500 outbreak response 
doses of MMR vaccine to Ocean County medical providers. 
This outbreak was declared over on January 16, 2019. A second 
outbreak occurred in the same community in March 2019, 
with no identified connection to the first outbreak.
In the New York outbreak, low community vaccination rates 
facilitated widespread measles transmission after introduction 
of imported measles in unvaccinated travelers. Educational 
efforts regarding risks associated with undervaccination should 
be increased in communities with low vaccination rates. 
Health departments and clinicians should be aware of multiple 
ongoing measles outbreaks globally, and travelers should have 
evidence of measles immunity.† All U.S. communities should

On December 31, 2018, Clark County Public Health 
(CCPH) in Washington was notified of a suspected case of 
measles in an unvaccinated child, aged 10 years, who had 
recently arrived from Ukraine. The patient was evaluated at 
an urgent care clinic for fever, cough, and a maculopapular 
rash. CCPH launched a case investigation, conducted contact 
tracing, and facilitated specimen collection and shipment to 
the Washington State Department of Health Public Health 
Laboratories. On January 3, 2019, measles virus was detected 
in the patient’s urine and nasopharyngeal specimens by reverse 
transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). By 
January 16, among 12 patients with suspected measles reported 
to CCPH during January 11–14, all had laboratory-confirmed 
measles by RT-PCR. In response to these confirmed cases and 
additional suspected cases, CCPH’s Incident Management 
Team was activated on January 15. Approximately 200 per -
sons participated in the multiagency response, which included 
CCPH, the Washington State Department of Health, and 
CDC. As of March 28, 2019, measles had been confirmed 
among 71 Clark County residents, with rash onsets from 
December 30, 2018, to March 13, 2019.
Persons with suspected measles were investigated through 
patient interviews, electronic medical records review, and 
consultation with health care providers; specimens were col -
lected in accordance with recommendations ( 1). To increase 
awareness of measles circulation, regional provider advisories 
were issued, and press releases were distributed to notify citi -
zens of exposures in large settings. Outbreak control measures 
included identifying exposed persons and assessment of their 
presumptive immunity to measles,* recommending vaccina -
tion of persons lacking presumptive evidence of immunity, 
administering postexposure prophylaxis with measles, mumps, 
rubella vaccine or immunoglobulin for eligible persons, and 
implementing social distancing strategies (e.g., isolation of 
patients and home quarantine of exposed persons without 
presumptive evidence of immunity) ( 2).
Among the 71 patients with confirmed measles, all of 
whom met the clinical case definition for measles,† 41 cases 
* Acceptable presumptive evidence of immunity to measles includes written 
documentation of age-appropriate vaccination, laboratory evidence of 
immunity, laboratory confirmation of disease, or birth before 1957.
† Fever; maculopapular rash; and cough, coryza, or conjunctivitis.were laboratory-confirmed and 30 were epidemiologically 
linked to confirmed cases ( 3). Patients were aged 1–39 years 
(median = 8 years); 52 (73%) were children aged ≤10 years. 
Sixty-one (86%) were unvaccinated, three (4%) had received 
1 dose of measles, mumps, rubella vaccine before measles 
exposure, and vaccination status was unknown for seven 
(10%). Genotype D8, which is currently circulating in Eastern 
Europe, was identified in all 18 specimens tested ( 4). No new 
confirmed cases have been identified since March 13, 2019.
Approximately 3,800 named contacts of the 71 patients were 
identified from 46 known exposures at Clark County health 
care facilities, workplaces, churches, schools, and child care 
centers, as well as social gatherings and home settings. Among 
these contacts, 22% lacked acceptable presumptive evidence 
of measles immunity.
Households and churches were the predominant settings for 
transmission, associated with 36 (51%) and 18 (25%) of the 71 
patients, respectively (Figure). Public exposures (i.e., church, 
school, and child care centers) most commonly occurred dur -
ing the first 4 weeks of the outbreak, and decreased following 
communitywide implementation of CCPH-recommended 
outbreak control measures. Among the 30 patients identified 
after February 1, 26 (87%) were known contacts in quarantine 
and under active surveillance, decreasing public exposures by 
implementing effective social distancing strategies.
Clark County had not experienced a measles outbreak since 
2011, when three cases were confirmed ( 5). Since 2013, county 
vaccination rates have remained 10%–14% lower than the 
statewide average (88%) ( 6). Additional U.S. jurisdictions 
are experiencing concurrent, unrelated measles outbreaks ( 7). 
As of May 10, 2019, the 839 measles cases identified in 23 
states nationwide had surpassed the case counts observed dur -
ing the same period every year since 2000, when measles was 
declared eliminated in the United States (range = 6–164; CDC, 
unpublished data). The current U.S. outbreaks underscore the 
importance of maintaining 2-dose measles vaccination cover -
age of ≥95% and of rapid public health responses in an era of 
increasing measles exposure threat, both in the United States 
and around the world.

Acanthamoeba  Keratitis Cases — Iowa, 
2002–2017
Brittni A. Scruggs, MD, PhD1; Tyler S. Quist, MD1;  
Jorge L. Salinas, MD2; Mark A. Greiner, MD1,3
Acanthamoeba  is a ubiquitous protozoan that feeds on 
bacteria and yeast. Because of its ability to encyst in extreme 
environmental conditions, the organism is difficult to kill. 
Contact lens wearers exposed to any water source are at high -
est risk for developing Acanthamoeba  keratitis (AK), a severe 
corneal infection that can result in painful blindness. Variable 
findings when patients seek treatment contribute to the under -
diagnosis of AK, and the amoeba’s resistance to killing makes 
AK a challenging infection to treat for ophthalmologists. The 
incidence of Acanthamoeba  keratitis in the United States is 
estimated to be one to two new cases per 1 million contact 
lens wearers annually ( 1); approximately 16.7% of U.S. adults 
wear contact lenses ( 2). Among the estimated 2.42 million Iowa 
residents aged ≥18 years, including an expected 404,267 adult 
contact lens wearers (16.7%), 0.4–0.8 new AK cases per year 
would be expected in Iowa. However, the University of Iowa 
Hospitals & Clinics (UIHC), the only tertiary care center in 
Iowa, diagnosed 15 new AK cases in 2015, 14 of which were 
adults. Because of this apparent excess in occurrent cases, a 
retrospective investigation was performed to ascertain AK cases 
evaluated at UIHC during a 16-year period.
Electronic records were queried to identify patients with 
corneal infections treated at UIHC during 2002–2017. A 
confirmed AK case was defined as detection of Acanthamoeba  
using confocal microscopy or corneal scraping, which was 
analyzed by an ocular pathologist for amoebic cysts. Overall, 
111 confirmed AK cases were identified, including 75 (67.6%) 
in Iowa residents. For the following reasons, it is unlikely that 
any Iowa AK cases defined using the criteria described are 
not included in this cohort: AK cannot be diagnosed empiri -
cally, and UIHC uses the only clinical ophthalmic confocal 
microscope in Iowa and employs the only ocular pathologist 
in the state.
During 2002–2017, Iowa’s adult population increased 
7.3%, from 2.25 million to 2.41 million persons*; 27,539 
(16.7%) of the new 164,905 Iowa residents aged ≥18 years 
were expected to have been contact lens wearers. This increase 
* U.S. Census Bureau estimates. Percentage change in population is calculated 
based on the unrounded population. in the population at risk for AK (i.e., one to two new cases 
per 1 million contact lens wearers annually) corresponds to 
an expected increase of 0.03–0.06 new AK cases in 2017, 
compared with 2002. However, among all Iowa residents, the 
average number of new AK cases per year increased from 2.9 
cases during 2002–2009 to 6.5 cases during 2010–2017. The 
number of new AK cases doubled among residents during 
2012–2014 (Figure).
Among Iowans with confirmed AK, the median age was 
32 years (range = 8–80 years), and 40 (53.3%) patients were 
women. Six (8%) patients were aged <18 years. Most patients had 
at least one risk factor, including contact lens wear (63; 84.0%), 
corneal injury (12; 16.0%), or eye exposure to organic mate -
rial (e.g., dirt or algae) (12; 16.0%). Among the 63 affected 
contact lens wearers, 54 (85.7%) reported inadequate contact 
lens hygiene, and the majority reported recent water exposure, 
including swimming in lakes or rivers while wearing contacts 
(14; 22.2%), showering while wearing contacts (11; 17.5%), 
or cleaning contacts with tap water (eight; 12.7%). T wenty-one 
(33.3%) patients reported wearing contacts while sleeping, and 
19 (30.2%) wore their contacts for longer than recommended 
by the manufacturer. AK was most prevalent in the summer (23 
cases; 30.7%), followed by fall (21; 28.0%), winter (16; 21.3%), 
and spring (15; 20.0%). The average interval from symptom 
onset to diagnosis was 1.2 months (range = 0–4.4 months). 
Late diagnoses contributed to poor vision, and 31 Iowans with 
AK (41.3%) were legally blind (visual acuity <20/200) in the 
affected eye at first evaluation. Thirty-five (46.7%) patients ulti -
mately required surgical intervention because of Acanthamoeba  
resistance to medical therapy.
AK is a sight-threatening condition, and outbreaks have 
been linked to specific contact lens solutions ( 3), hard water 
with lime scale ( 4), and biofilm contamination of domestic 
and recreational water ( 5,6). The expanding problem of algal 
bloom and nutrient pollution in Iowa waters might also be 
contributing to an increase in pathogenic Acanthamoeba  species 
and the rising number of AK cases ( 6). Although this investiga -
tion was limited by its retrospective design and analysis of data 
obtained from a single center, UIHC is likely to evaluate most 
AK cases in Iowa. To prevent contact lens–related infections, 
including AK, CDC recommends that contact lens users not 
use tap water to clean contacts, swim or shower while wearing 
contacts, wear contacts for longer than recommended, or wear 
contacts while sleeping ( 7).

 * With 95% confidence intervals indicated with error bars. Estimates are age-adjusted to the year 2000 standard 
population using three age groups: 18–44 years, 45–64 years, and ≥65 years.
 † Based on responses to the question “Thinking about the last time you had pain, how much pain did you have? 
Would you say a little, a lot, or somewhere in between?” Approximately 12.2% of those with incomes <200% 
of the poverty threshold, 13.2% of those with incomes 200%–400% of the poverty threshold, and 14.8% of 
those with incomes >400% of the poverty threshold reported never having pain in the last 3 months." 
 § Based on responses to the question “In the past 3 months, how often did you have pain? Would you say 
never, some days, most days, or every day?” Response categories “most days” and “every day” were combined. 
Unknowns were not included in the denominators when calculating percentages.
 ¶ Family income groups were defined based on family income as a percentage of the federal poverty threshold. 
Poverty thresholds, which are published by the U.S. Census Bureau, vary by family size and the number of 
children in the family. Family income was imputed when missing using multiple imputation methodology.
 ** Estimates are based on household interviews of a sample of the noninstitutionalized U.S. civilian population aged 
≥18 years and are derived from the National Health Interview Survey Functioning and Disability component.
During 2016–2017, among those reporting pain, the percentage of adults ≥18 years who experienced a lot of pain on some 
days in the last 3 months increased with family income, from 28.6% among those with income <200% of the poverty threshold 
to 55.9% among those with income ≥400% of the poverty threshold. In contrast, the percentage reporting a lot of pain on most 
or every day decreased with increasing family income, from 71.4% among those at the lowest income level to 44.1% among 
those at the highest income level.
