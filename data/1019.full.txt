Objective
 T
o characterise whether preseason screening 
of shoulder range of motion (ROM) is associated with the 
risk of shoulder and elbow injuries in overhead athletes.Design
 Systematic review and meta-
 analysis
.
Data sources
 Six electronic databases up to 22 
September 2018.Eligibility criteria
 Inclusion criteria were (1) overhead 
athletes from Olympic or college sports
, (2) preseason 
measures of shoulder ROM, (3) tracked in-
 season injuries 
at the shoulder and elbow,
 and (4) prospective cohort 
design. Exclusion criteria were (1) included contact injuries, (2) lower extremity, spine and hand injuries, and (3) full report not published in English.Results
 Fifteen studies were identified,
 and they 
included 3314 overhead athletes (baseball (74.6%), softball (3.1%), handball (16.1%), tennis (2.0%), volleyball (2.0%) and swimming (2.2%)). Female athletes are unrepresented (12% of the overall sample). Study quality ranged from 11 to 18 points on a modified Downs and Black checklist (maximum score 21, better quality). In one study, swimmers with low (<93°) or high (>100°) shoulder external rotation were at higher risk of injuries. Using data pooled from three studies of professional baseball pitchers, we showed in the meta-
 
analysis that shoulder external rotation insufficiency (throwing arm <5° greater than the non-
 throwing 
arm) w
as associated with injury (odds ratio=1.90, 95% 
confidence interval 1.24 to 2.92, p<0.01).Conclusion
 Preseason screening of shoulder external 
rotation ROM may identify professional baseball pitchers and swimmers at risk of injury.
 Shoulder ROM screening 
may not be effective to identify handball, softball, volleyball and tennis players at risk of injuries. The results of this systematic review and meta-
 analysis should be 
interpreted with caution due to the limited number of studies and their high degree of heterogeneity.PRO

Overuse shoulder and elbow injuries are common 
across different overhead athletes regardless of age, sex and level of playing.
1–5 Evaluating potential 
environmental-
 specific 
(extrinsic) and individual-
 
specific 
(intrinsic) risk factors for shoulder and elbow 
injuries in overhead athletes is a research priority. Extrinsic risk factors include sport specialisation, training intensity, number of games per week, and number of pitches or throws per game and over a 
year.
6–10 Extrinsic factors may contribute to overuse 
injuries due to repetitive load on the shoulder and elbow without adequate time to recover. Intrinsic non-
 modifiable 
risk factors include age, height, sex 
and previous injury.6 7 Impairments of joint range 
of motion (ROM) except when attributable to humeral torsion,
11–17 strength18 19 and neuromus-
cular control20 are intrinsic modifiable risk factors 
because their effect may be modifiable through targeted injury prevention programmes.
21
Changes or side-  to-  side differences of shoulder 
ROM 
result from the repetitive demands of over -
head sport,22–24 but they may also be a risk factor 
for injury. In Keller’s systematic review, injured overhead athletes (baseball, handball and tennis) had deficits of shoulder internal rotation, external rotation and total rotation ROM.
16 Limitations 
included studies with cross-
 sectional 
and retrospec-
tive designs, so it is impossible to determine whether the deficits in ROM were present before the injury or were an adaptation to the injury.
16 Using 
prospective cohort studies, Bullock et al’s17 meta-  
analysis showed 
that high school baseball players 
who sustained an in-
 season shoulder and elbow 
injuries have less preseason shoulder internal rota
-
tion (absolute value: 44°, side-
 to-
 side difference: 
5°) and total rotation (absolute value 160°, side-
 to-
 
side difference: 8°) ROM compared with players who did not sustain 
an injury during the season. 
However, the authors did not report the magni-tude of risk of in-
 season injuries 
with an odds or 
risk ratio for the players with the defined preseason ROM values.
17 Understanding the strength of the 
association between risk factors (preseason ROM) and outcomes (injury) is critical to evaluate the ability of preseason ROM to predict risk of injury in overhead athletes, and to design screening and prevention programmes.
21
The purpose of this systematic review and meta-  
analysis was to summarise the available 
evidence, 
to evaluate the quality of research methods and to characterise the association of preseason shoulder ROM with future risk of shoulder and elbow inju-ries in prospective cohorts of overhead athletes. We hypothesised that preseason ROM measures of shoulder internal rotation, external rotation, hori-zontal adduction, shoulder flexion and total rota-tion have the potential to identify overhead athletes at risk of shoulder and elbow injuries. on August 12, 2024 by guest.

METhODs
This review was performed according to the Preferred Reporting 
Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-
 Analyses guidelines.25 
The review protocol was registered on PROSPERO.
Data source and search
The following databases were queried for existing evidence (from their inception to September 2018): MEDLINE, Scopus, Embase, Cochrane Library, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature and SPORTdiscus (via Ebsco). A full-
 
time librarian from the Norris 
Medical Library of the Univer -
sity of Southern California developed and conducted the search strategy for each database. The search strategies used to query MEDLINE and Cochrane Library are reported in online supple-mentary appendix A and were adapted for the other databases. Three senior authors with expertise in upper extremity injury in overhead athletes (ES, CAT and LAM) reviewed the list of the included studies to identify studies that were not found through the systematic search of the databases. Further, the reference list of the included studies was hand searched for additional missing studies.
study selection
Identified articles were imported in Endnote (Clarivate Analytics, Philadelphia, USA) to screen for duplicates. Afterward, they were exported into Covidence (Covidence systematic review soft-ware, Veritas Health Innovation, Melbourne, Australia; available at www.
 covidence.
 org) for screening and 
full-
 text 
selection. The 
following inclusion criteria were used to determine eligibility: (1) inclusion of overhead athletes from Olympic or National Collegiate Athletic Association sanctioned collegiate sports (wide participation), (2) use of preseason measures of ROM; (3) tracked injuries at the shoulder and/or elbow throughout the season, and (4) use of a prospective cohort design. Exclusion criteria included the following: (1) sport does not require over -
head repetitive activities; (2) inclusion of contact injuries; (3) lower extremity, spine and hand injuries; and (4) full report not published in English. Studies that assessed humeral retrotorsion were excluded from this review because this physical impairment is not modifiable.
26 27 Studies that assessed the effectiveness of 
specific interventions to reduce the risk of shoulder and elbow injuries were excluded from this review.
T wo authors (FP and HAP) independently screened the title 
and abstract to identify relevant studies for the full-
 text review
. A 
subsample of 100 studies were randomly selected to calculate the agreement between the two reviewers (Cohen’s kappa=0.88, indicating high level of agreement). During both the title and abstract screening and the full-
 text 
review, disagreements 
between the two authors were first discussed. If consensus was not achieved, a third author (LAM) was consulted to make the final decision regarding inclusion or exclusion.
Assessment of methodological quality
T wo authors (PF and HAP) independently scored the method -
ological quality of each included study using a modified version of the Downs and Black Checklist.
28 The Cochrane Handbook 
recommends the use of this checklist to appraise non-
 randomised 
studies.29 The original Down and Black Checklist contains 
27 yes/no questions distributed over five sections: reporting, external validity, internal validity (bias and selection bias) and power. Previous systematic reviews that investigated injury risk factors in athletes recommended modifying the Downs and Black Checklist because 6 out of the original 27 questions do not apply to prospective cohort studies.
20 30 Further, the score 
of question number 27 (Did the study have sufficient power to detect a clinically important effect where the probability value for a difference being due to chance is less than 5%?) was converted into a dichotomous output (yes=1, the study met the a priori sample target; no=0, the study did not report or did not meet the a priori sample target). The modified checklist used in this study had a maximum score of 21 points, which indicated higher methodological quality. For each article, the raw score and the percentage score [(raw score/21 possible points)×100] was reported. During the assessment of methodological quality, disagreements between the two authors were first discussed. If consensus was not achieved, a third author (LAM) was consulted to make the final decision regarding specific scores.
Data extraction
One author (FP) extracted the data, which was checked for consistency by a second author (HAP). The following informa-tion was obtained: (1) author, (2) year of publication, (3) sport, (4) study population, (4) sample size, (5) sex, (6) age, (7) partic-ipants reporting discomfort or injury at baseline evaluation, (8) participants lost to follow-
 up, 
(9) number of participants 
included in the analysis, (10) number of seasons, (11) injury definition, (12) injury tracking, (13) number of injuries and (14) number of injured participants.
Outcome measures
Injury
An injury was defined as any shoulder-  related or elbow-  related 
complaint incurred due to competition or 
training.31 Injuries to 
the shoulder and elbow had to be tracked during the season by 
healthcare personnel, in-
 season player interview 
or self-
 reported 
questionnaires.
Range of motion
ROM testing procedures, the direction of ROM testing and the side tested were recorded. ROM measurements included two types of variables: (1) absolute ROM of the throwing arm and (2) ROM of the throwing arm expressed as a function of the ROM of the non-
 throwing 
arm. The latter often includes 
a specific ROM cut-
 off to define the absence or presence of a 
specific ROM deficit. 
The type of ROM measure and the cut-
 off 
used to identify ROM deficit were extracted for the analysis.
Data analysis
Only ROM variables that were included as predictors in at least three studies were considered for the meta-
 analysis. 
For 
the studies included in the meta-
 analysis, 
odds or risk ratios, 
confidence intervals and p values were extracted. A random-
 
effect 
meta-
 analysis 
was conducted using the method of Mantel-
 
Haenszel stratified by the direction of ROM and the type of measurement (absolute and deficit). The primary outcome was shoulder and elbow 
injuries. For all ROM measurements, except 
for shoulder internal rotation difference, the summarised effect estimate was the odds ratios. For shoulder internal rotation difference, Shanley et al
12 reported the risk ratio as effect esti-
mate, while Wilk et al32 33 reported the odds ratio. In order to 
synthesise the data between these studies12 32 33 and to provide an 
overall estimate, crude odds ratios were converted to crude risk ratios using the formula
 RR=OR/[
1−R0+(
R0X OR)]

tudy selection
The database search was completed on 22 September 2018. The search identified 10
 539 studies (
figure
 
1): 2855 duplicates 
were removed; 7684 studies were screened; and 93 studies were reviewed in full text. Fifteen studies
11–15 32–41 met the inclusion 
and exclusion criteria and were included.
study characteristics
Table  1  summarises the characteristics of the included studies. 
A total of 3314 (female=385) athletes of overhead sports were included in this review, specifically, baseball (n=2471, female=27), softball (n=103, all female), handball (n=535, female=161), tennis (n=65, female=25), volleyball (n=66, female=32) and swimming (n=74, female=37). Six studies included samples of both female and male athletes,
12–14 34 39 40 
but only one considered sex as a covariate in the analysis.39 One 
study12 included a cohort of baseball and softball players but 
reported independent analyses for each sport. One study35 
included a cohort of youth and adolescent baseball pitchers but reported independent analyses for each age group. A group of authors reported data from the same cohort in two different manuscripts, one that analysed risk factors for shoulder
32 and 
one for elbow injuries.33 Most of the studies followed up athletes 
for one competitive season. Nine studies tracked injuries across multiple seasons (range of two to eight seasons).11 32 33 35 37 38 40 41 
Athletes were re-
 evaluated 
at the beginning of each season in 
seven studies,11 32 33 35 37 38 41 while one considered injuries occur -
ring over a 2-
 year span.40 After accounting for athletes evaluated 
for multiple seasons and lost to follow-
 up, the total included 
sample 
was 3750, specifically baseball (n=3026), softball 
(n=103), handball (n=428), tennis (n=55), volleyball (n=64) and swimming (n=74).
Injury definition varied across studies (table
 
1). The cumu-
lative shoulder and elbow injury rate in the overall sample of overhead athletes was 17% (666/3750). Divided by sport, the cumulative shoulder and elbow injury rate was 14% (431/3026) for baseball,
11 12 32–38 41 9% (9/103) for softball,12 43% (182/428) 
for handball,15 39 44% (24/55) for tennis,40 4% (3/64) for volley -
ball14 and 23% (17/74) for swimming.13
Risk of bias
The average score on the modified Downs and Black Check-list was 14.9%±2.1% (range 11–18, online supplementary appendix B). Six studies achieved a score of at least 16, which is greater than 75%.
11 13 15 34 36 39
ROM measurements
Shoulder ROM directions included flexion, internal and external rotation, and horizontal adduction. Shoulder flexion ROM was measured using a standard goniometer with partic-ipants supine, and this methodology was consistent across studies.
11 32 33 40 Shoulder internal and external rotation ROMs 
were measured either with a goniometer11 12 14 32 33 38 or a digital 
inclinometer13 15 35–37 39 41 with participants supine with shoulder 
abducted at 90° and elbow flexed at 90°. Horizontal adduc-tion ROM was measured with either a goniometer
11 12 34 or a 
digital inclinometer35 37 41 with participants supine, according 
to the procedure described by Laudner et al.42 Further, nine 
studies11 12 15 32–34 36–39 41 calculated the total rotation of motion 
by summing internal and external ROMs.
Preseason screening and in-season shoulder and elbow 
injuries
Methodological differences prevented including the results 
of eight studies in the meta-
 analysis.13 14 34 37 38 40 41 43 Three 
studies32 33 38 from the same group of investigators had overlap-
ping data collection time frames: three competitive seasons, from 2005 to 2008,
38 and eight competitive seasons, from 2005 to 
2012.32 33 Only the data from the eight competitive seasons were 
included in the meta-
 analysis.32 33 Softball players were excluded 
from the internal rotation deficit meta-
 analysis 
because none of 
the nine softball players with at least 20° of shoulder internal rota-tion deficit sustained an injury.
12 Table  2  summarises the results 
excluded from the meta-
 analysis. 
Shanley et al35 used a receiver 
operating characteristics curve to calculate the preseason cut-
 off 
of shoulder ROM 
deficit with the highest sensitivity for risk of 
shoulder and elbow injuries. In adolescent baseball pitchers, a shoulder internal rotation deficit of at least 13° and a shoulder horizontal adduction deficit of at least 15° were associated with a 5.8 and 4.1 greater risks of shoulder and elbow injuries.
35 The 
same analysis did not produce any significant results in youth baseball pitchers.
35 Shanley et al12 reported that high school 
baseball players with deficit of shoulder internal rotation ROM greater than 25° are at higher risk (risk ratio=4.8) of injury. In contrast, T yler et al
37 reported that high school pitchers with no 
internal rotation deficit (side-
 to-
 side difference of less than 0°) 
are at higher risk of shoulder and elbow 
injuries (risk ratio=4.9)  on August 12, 2024 by guest. Protected by copyright. http://bjsm.bmj.com/ Br J Sports Med: first published as 10.1136/bjsports-2019-100698 on 14 January 2020. Downloaded from

high (>100°) absolute shoulder external rotations are at risk of a shoulder injury (odds ratios=24.9
 and 
23.0, respectively) 
compared with swimmers with shoulder external rotation within 93° and 100°. The odds ratios increased to 32.5 (external rota-tion <93°) and 35.4 (external rotation >100°) when the statis-tical model included swimming training distance. Prospective studies in softball,

that preseason shoulder ROM is not associated with in-
 season 
shoulder and elbow injuries.

and external rotations,13 14 40 41 as well as total rotation,34 41 but 
the methodological differences13 41 in the predictive analysis or 
incomplete results reporting14 40 prevented from including these 
studies in the respective meta-
 analysis. Only one study measured 
the absolute 
value of shoulder flexion and shoulder hori-
zontal adduction.11 The results of the meta-  analyses indicated 
that absolute shoulder ROM is not associated with shoulder and elbow injuries (figure
 
2). A large degree of heterogeneity 
between studies was found for the absolute value of absolute shoulder internal rotation (I
2=71.9%, p=0.03) and total rota-
tion (I2=62.1%, p=0.07) ROMs.Independent meta- analyses evaluated shoulder 
flexion,11 32 33 external rotation11 32 33 and internal rotation 
ROM differences.12 32 33 Other studies measured external rota-
tion differences34 36 37 41 and internal rotation differences,34–37 41 
but methodological disparities in the predictive analysis,37 41 
exclusion from multivariate predictive analysis34 and different 
angle cutoffs used to define ROM deficits35 36 prevented from 
including these studies in the respective meta-
 analyses. 
Shoulder 
total rotation and horizontal adduction ROM differences were 
measured in seven12 32 33 36–38 41 and four11 12 34 35 studies, respec-
tively. However, the methodological differences in the predic-tive analysis,
37 41 the different cut-  offs used to define shoulder 
total rotation or horizontal adduction deficit,11 12 32 33 35 36 38 
and exclusion from multivariate predictive analysis,34 prevented 
combining the data in meta-
 analyses. 
Three side-
 to-
 side 
ROM 
cut-
 offs were 
consistently used across studies to define specific 
ROM deficits: (1) shoulder flexion: non-
 throwing arm–throwing 
arm >5°11 32 33; (2) shoulder external rotation: throwing arm–
non-
 throwing 
arm >5°11 32 33 and (3) shoulder internal rotation: 
non-
 throwing arm–throwing arm >20°.12 32 33 The results of the 
meta-
 analyses indicated that the presence of a 5° insufficiency of 
shoulder external rotation between the throwing and the non-
 
throwing arms (ie, 
external rotation in the throwing arm was <5° 
greater than the non-
 throwing arm) is 
significantly associated 
with in-
 season shoulder and elbow injuries (odds ratio=1.90, 
95% confidence 
interval 1.24 to 2.92, p<0.01; figure

effect estimates of the meta-
 analysis for external rotation 
insuffi-
ciency did not have substantial heterogeneity (I2=0%, p=0.50).  on August 12, 2024 by guest. Protected by copyright. http://bjsm.bmj.com/ Br J Sports Med: first published as 10.1136/bjsports-2019-100698 on 14 January 2020. Downloaded from

In contrast, a large degree of heterogeneity between studies was

Overall, the funnel plot was fairly symmetrical and contained 
within the borders of the funnel, indicating limited publication bias (figure
 
3). However, there is some evidence of publication 
bias for external rotation ROM deficit. The funnel plot posi-tive asymmetry suggests that negative or null studies are missing from the published literature. Last, there was no evidence of small study bias (p=0.35).
DIsCussIOn
This systematic review summarised the available evidence, eval-uated methodological quality and analysed whether preseason screening of shoulder ROM is associated with the risk of shoulder and elbow injuries in overhead athletes. Overall, we identified 15 prospective cohort studies,
11–15 32–41 with the majority focusing on baseball. Limited evidence was available 
for other overhead sports, such as handball, softball, volleyball, swimming and tennis. Female athletes are under-
 represented, 
accounting for 12% of the overall sample (34% after removing studies 
on baseball, which is a male-
 predominant sports). Only 
one pros
pective cohort study of a female-
 predominant 
sport of 
softball12 was identified for this review. Our overall hypothesis 
that preseason shoulder ROM across all overhead athletes identi-fies those at risk for upper extremity injuries was not confirmed. Summarising the evidence for the meta-
 analysis was challenging 
due 
to the methodological differences between studies. The 
meta-
 analysis 
included three shoulder absolute ROM variables 
(external, internal and total rotations) and three shoulder ROM deficit (flexion, internal rotation and external rotation). The results of the meta-
 analysis indicated that professional baseball 
pitchers were at higher risk of shoulder and elbow injuries when  on August 12, 2024 by guest. Protected by copyright. http://bjsm.bmj.com/ Br J Sports Med: first published as 10.1136/bjsports-2019-100698 on 14 January 2020. Downloaded from

Figure 3  Overall , the plot indicates that all reported studies lie within the 95% confidence limits, suggesting limited reporting bias. The proximity of 
most studies to the solid black line indicates the null results observed in the bulk of included studies. Some asymmetry is noted, especially for external 
rotation deficit, indicating likely reporting bias for this exposure.
the throwing arm external rotation was not at least 5° greater 
than the non-
 throwing 
arm. Therefore, screening shoulder 
external rotation ROM may be valuable in professional baseball pitchers.
Risk of bias
Four studies failed to outline the inclusion and exclusion criteria used to select their sample.
32 33 37 41 The number of the athletes 
who were lost to follow-
 up 
was clearly described in three 
studies,13 34 39 and five studies reported both the number of 
athletes that were approached and the number of athletes who agreed to participate.
15 34 36 39 40 Therefore, some of the included 
studies may suffer from selection bias. The investigator respon -
sible for preseason measurements was blinded for hand domi-nance in three studies,
12 35 36 exposing the remaining studies to 
potential investigator bias. Only five studies adjusted the analysis for potential confounders.
11 13 15 32 39 Three studies calculated 
the required sample size a priori12 34 36: two studies met their 
target sample size34 36; one study recruited 82% of the estimated 
sample due to limited time to perform preseason screening.12 
Therefore, the majority of the studies may lack sufficient sample size. Three studies did not report the investigator reliability in collecting shoulder ROM.
11 34 37 Andersson et al39 reported poor 
inter-
 rater and intrarater reliabil
ities for their ROM measure-
ments, which are a critical threat to internal validity that can bias their results.
baseball
The risk of shoulder or elbow injuries increased almost twofold if the throwing shoulder of professional baseball pitchers did not have at least 5° greater external rotation compared with the non-
 throwing shoulder
. It is well accepted that the throwing arm of overhead athletes displays greater external rotation ROM 
compared with the non-
 throwing arm.44 45 Greater shoulder 
external rotation increases the amount of motion available to develop ball velocity.
46–48 Professional baseball pitchers with less 
throwing arm external rotation may employ other strategies, such as dropping their arm slot or allowing their arm to lag behind, to maintain throwing performance, which may place them at higher risk of injury.
49 50 The fact that less throwing arm shoulder 
external rotation was associated with shoulder or elbow injury in two independent cohorts of professional baseball pitchers further corroborates the value of screening external rotation ROM in this population.
11 21 32 The ultimate goal of athlete screening is 
to reduce their risk of injury by intervening on modifiable risk factors.
21 Therefore, randomised clinical trials that compare the 
efficacy of the screening and intervention programme compared with usual training and prevention programmes only are neces-sary to fully understand the value of screening for shoulder external rotation deficit in professional baseball pitchers.
In contrast, younger baseball pitchers and position players (age 
7–18 years) do not consistently display differences in shoulder external rotation in the throwing arm compared with the non-
 
throwing 
arm.51 Although not included in the meta-  analysis, 
four studies34 36 37 41 failed to find a positive association between 
shoulder external rotation difference and subsequent risk of shoulder or elbow injuries in cohorts of junior and high-
 school 
baseball 
players. Bullock et al17 found no absolute differences of 
preseason shoulder external rotation ROM between a group of high school baseball players who suffered an in-
 season shoulder 
or elbow injury and a 
group who did not. Adaptation of shoulder 
external rotation ROM may occur over several years of playing and with increased level of performance, which may explain the findings in younger cohorts. on August 12, 2024 by guest.

The current meta-  analysis indicates that a shoulder internal 
rotation difference 
of at least 20° between the throwing and the 
non-
 throwing arms is 
not associated with future shoulder and 
elbow injuries. The heterogeneity of the studies included in the 
meta-
 analysis, 
which combined professional baseball pitchers32 33 
and high school baseball players (position players included),12 
must be considered when interpreting these results. Shoulder internal rotation may not be an important risk factor for profes-sional baseball pitchers.
11 32 33 In contrast, a recent meta-  analysis 
showed that a 
preseason side-
 to-
 side difference 
of at least 5° of 
shoulder internal rotation characterised high school baseball players that sustained an in-
 season 
injury.17 Screening for 5° side-  
to-
 side difference 
in shoulder internal rotation may generate a 
high number of false positives, considering that previous studies found that only greater internal rotation difference (favouring the non-
 throwing 
arm) carried a higher risk of shoulder and 
elbow injuries (at least of 13°, adolescent pitchers, and at least 25°, high school baseball players; table
 2
).12 35 Additionally, one 
study found that high school baseball pitchers with no shoulder internal rotation deficit in their throwing arm have a higher inci-dence and a higher risk of shoulder and elbow injuries compared with those with at least 20° of shoulder internal rotation differ -
ences between the throwing and non-
 throwing 
arms.37 Thus, 
unwarranted stretching, which arbitrarily increases the internal rotation on the throwing arm, may also be deleterious for high school baseball players.
A shoulder flexion deficit of at least 5° in the throwing arm 
is not associated with shoulder and elbow injuries in a homog-enous sample of professional baseball pitchers. It is important to note that the anatomical location of the injury was different between the studies included in this meta-
 analysis. 
T wo studies 
considered only elbow injuries,11 33 while one considered only 
shoulder injuries.32 Based on the reported OR (figure  2), it is 
unclear 
why shoulder flexion ROM deficit in the throwing 
arm would be associated with risk of injury at the elbow, but not at the shoulder. Reduced shoulder flexion may be related to altered latissimus dorsi muscle flexibility. A shoulder flexion deficit of 5° in the throwing arm may result in a lower arm slot during throwing, which has been shown to increase elbow joint stress.
52 53 Future studies should investigate this potential 
association.
Bullock et al17 showed that, when measured at preseason, 
high school baseball players that sustained in-
 season shoulder 
and 
elbow injuries had at least 8° lower horizontal adduction 
ROM compared with players who did not get injured.17 When 
included in risk analysis, Shanley et al35 found that high school 
baseball pitchers with a difference of horizontal adduction of at least 15° between the throwing and non-
 throwing 
arms were at 
four times greater risks of shoulder and elbow injuries. Similar findings were not reported in one cohort of professional baseball pitchers,
11 or in studies including cohorts that combined high 
school baseball pitchers and position players.12 34 Taken together, 
these findings may indicate that players’ age and position should be considered when screening horizontal adduction ROM.
Other overhead sports
The evidence available for other overhead sports was limited to two prospective cohorts from the same group of researchers for handball, and one prospective cohort each for softball, volley -
ball, tennis and swimming.
The two studies
15 39 that screened absolute shoulder ROM 
of the throwing arm in handball players found opposite results. Clarsen et al
15 reported a small positive association between shoulder total rotation ROM and injury and no association for internal rotation ROM. In contrast, Andersson et al
39 reported 
a small positive association between shoulder internal rotation ROM and injury and no association for total rotation ROM. Caution is warranted when interpreting the results from Andersson et al
39 due to the poor inter-  rater and intrarater 
reliability of the ROM measurements. These studies also have some methodological differences that may, in part, explain these contradictory results. Clarsen et al
15 included only male hand-
ball players, while Andersson et al39 included both male and 
female. Each study used different confounders to adjust their analysis. Although both studies used the same definition of overuse injury consistent with a non-
 contact injury mechanism, 
Clarsen et al15 acknowledged the inclusion of injuries that were 
acute flare-
 ups of chronic problems, long-
 term problems 
initially 
caused an acute trauma or purely caused by an acute trauma. The inclusion of acute injuries may also explain the higher injury rate (52%) reported by Clarsen et al
15 compared with the study of 
Andersson et al39 (22%).
While swimmers have different biomechanical demands 
compared with throwing sports, shoulder pain and injuries are common due to the high repetitions of overhead motion and training volume.
2 Based on the results of one study,13 swimmers 
with external rotation ROM in the low and high tertiles are at higher risk of shoulder and elbow injuries compared with swim-mers whose shoulder external rotation ROM is within 93° and 100° (middle tertile). These results are independent of swimming training distance (table
 2
).13 This ideal external rotation ROM 
may be protective against shoulder injury, but confirmation of this finding in a second independent cohort of swimmers is needed before making strong recommendations for the use of shoulder ROM screening in this population.
21
Absolute shoulder ROM or shoulder ROM deficits were not 
associated with shoulder or elbow injury in high school softball players,
12 shoulder pain in professional volleyball players14 or 
upper extremity injury in tennis players.40
limitations
We acknowledge several limitations. Few prospective studies were identified for sports such as handball, softball, tennis, volleyball and swimming. The small number of studies included in each ROM meta-
 analysis 
(3 out of 15, 20%) is a significant 
limitation. With few studies, coverage of the overall effect size is of concern, and one cannot be certain that one large study is not determining the overall effect. Statistical power is limited when the number of studies is low. Lastly, the small number of studies prevented subgrouping within in each meta-
 analysis.
There 
was a high degree of heterogeneity among studies 
for age (youth to adults), position in baseball (pitchers only to combined cohort of pitchers and field players), competition level (competitive to professional athletes) and injury definition (overuse questionnaires, league managed disable lists, combina-tion of symptoms and sonographic findings, symptom duration, and missing time from sport performance, from one game/prac-tice, up to 3 weeks). Combining studies with substantial hetero-geneity can mask true differences between studies. It can also lead to combining valid studies with biassed research, producing a biassed overall estimate.
In-
 season injuries often occur several weeks or months 
after 
screening (preseason), and it is possible that the association between screening findings and injuries weakens over time. This is an inherent limitation of all the studies included in this system -
atic review, as none of the studies reported the time elapsed  on August 12, 2024 by guest. Protected by copyright. http://bjsm.bmj.com/ Br J Sports Med: first published as 10.1136/bjsports-2019-100698 on 14 January 2020. Downloaded from

between screening and injury. Future studies should investigate 
whether more frequent in-
 season screenings of factors theorised 
to relate to injury risk provide 
better identification of overhead 
athletes at risk of injury. Most of the included studies did not account for previous injury or exposure (ie, frequency of sport-
 
related activities) in the analysis. This is an important 
limitation 
as these factors have been linked to injury and can be poten-tial confounders. The aetiology of injury is multifactorial, and shoulder ROM represents only one risk factor for shoulder and elbow injuries. Thus, the results of this systematic review and meta-
 analysis should be interpreted with caution.
COnClusIOn
Absolute shoulder ROM or shoulder ROM differences do not appear to be consistent risk factors for shoulder and elbow inju-ries across different overhead athletes. Age, competition level and position should be considered when screening the shoulder ROM of baseball player. Professional baseball pitchers whose external rotation ROM in the throwing arm was not at least 5° greater than their non-
 throwing arm were 
twice as likely to 
sustain in-
 season 
shoulder or elbow injuries. Similar findings 
were not observed in adolescent or high school baseball pitchers. Limited evidence suggested that swimmers with abnormally low or high external rotation are at higher risk of shoulder inju-ries. Limited evidence suggested that ROM screening may not be effective to identify handball, softball, volleyball and tennis players at risk of shoulder and elbow injuries.
What is already known
 ►The repetitive demands of overhead sport lead to side-  to-  
side changes in shoulder range of motion (ROM),
 such as 
increased external rotation and decreased external rotation. 
However, injured overhead athletes have impairment of shoulder ROM compared with non-
 injured overhead athletes
.
What are the new findings
 ►Professional baseball pitchers whose external rotation ROM in the throwing arm is not at least 5° greater than the non-
 throwing arm were twice as lik
ely to sustain in-
 season 
shoulder or elbow injuries
 ►Limited evidence: swimmers with external rotation of less than 93° or greater than 100° may be at higher risk of shoulder injuries than swimmers whose ROM is between those limits.
 ►Limited evidence: ROM screening may not be effective to identify handball, softball, volleyball and tennis players at risk of shoulder and elbow injuries.
