Swimming gogglescausing severe
eyeinjuries
In1976inthishospital, whichservesapopulation ofabout15million,
wehaveseenthreecasesofsevereeyeinjuries causedbyapopular
typeofswimming goggle. Thechildren affected werepulling the
goggles forward inordertoclearthemofsteam,whentheyslipped

Tomyknowledge therehavebeennoreports ofsimilar injuries

goggles concerned weremadebydifferent manufacturers, butthe
designwasroughly thesame,andallhadastrongelasticstrap.Itisnotpossible tobecertainwhichpartofthegogglestrucktheeyes,and

Raisedmeancellvolume and
meningoencephalitis associated with
Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection
Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections arenotusually associated with
disorders ofthecentral nervous system (CNS). Theorganism,
however, should beconsidered asacausative agentinallcasesof
acuteneurological dysfunction, particularly inyoungpatients.' In
thefollowing casethediagnosis wassuspected owingtoaraisedmean
cellvolume(MCV)resulting fromcoldagglutination ofthepatient's
cellsintheCoulter counter.

A30-year-old housewife wastransferred tothishospital inApril1976.
Shehadbeenadmitted toAshford Hospital, Middlesex, threedaysearlier
withatwo-week historyofdepression, diplopia, andhesitancy ofmicturition
aftera"flu-like" illness. Examination ofthecerebrospinal fluid(CSF)at
Ashford hadshown 61-10'whitecells(predominantly lymphocytes)/l
(61/mm%), protein 1-1gl,andsugar31mmol1(56mg/100 ml).Viral
encephalitis wasdiagnosed. Hercondition deteriorated alarmingly, however,
andshewastransferred.
Onarrivalinourintensive careunitthepatienthadadecorticate posture
andresponded onlytopainful stimuli. Rectal temperature was38Â°C,
generalised convulsions withtonicrotation oftheneckwereevident, there
waspronounced cervical rigidity, andKernig's signwaspresent. Theoptic
discslookednormal. Respiratory function wasdepressed, andsherequired
intubation andassisted ventilation. Lumbar puncture showed theCSFto
contain 23101whitecells(predominantly lymphocytes)jl, protein 115g/l,
andsugar5-9mmol'l (106mg100ml)(bloodsugar81mmol,;146mg/
100ml).Further CSFstudiesshowed Wassermann reaction negative, Lange
curve4322222100, andnoorganisms, virus,ormycoplasmas. Haemoglobin
was119gdl,whitecellcount141091,(14000mm3)(90,neutrophils),
MCV110fl(um:'),erythrocyte sedimentation rate90mminfirsthour,
platelet count49010'il,andPaul-Bunnell reaction negative. Urea,electro-
lytes,liverfunction values, andplasma amylase wereallwithinnormal
limits.Bloodculture wassterile.Chestandskullxraypictures andanEMI
scanwerenormal. Anelectroencephalogram wasdevoidofnormalactivity
andshowed changes compatible withasevereencephalitic process.
Inviewoftheseverity oftheillnessandsignsofgeneralised toxicity
intravenous ampicillin wasstarted. TheraisedMCVwasfoundtobedueto
autoagglutination ofthepatient's cellsintheCoulter counter. Aspottest
confirmed thepresence ofcoldhaemagglutinins. Tetracycline treatment by
nasogastric tubewasbegunwhenMpnemnonia wassuspected asthecausa-
tiveorganism.
Thepatientgradually recovered andtheendotracheal tubewasremoved
48hourslater.Shewaseventually discharged hometwomonths afterthe
onsetofherillnesswithnoresidual neurological deficit.Atoutpatient follow-
upsheappeared tobewellphysically butstillhadsomeimpairment of
intellectual function andremained verydepressed.
