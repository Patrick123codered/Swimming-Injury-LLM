ABSTRACT
Objective : This study aims to investigate morphological alterations caused by partial sciatic
nerve ligation (PNL) and the e ﬃcacy of a moderate-intensity swimming training as therapeu-
tic strategy for nerve regeneration.
Methods : A number of 30 male adult mice were equally divided in control, 14 days after PNL
(PNL 14 days), 42 days after PNL (PNL 42 days), 70 days after PNL (PNL 70 days) and 5-week
exercise training after 7 days post-lesion (PNL trained 35 days) groups. PNL trained 35 days
group began with a 10-min session for 3 days and this time was gradually increased by
10 min every three sessions until the animals had swum for 50 min per session.
Morphoquantitative analysis was carried out to assess nerve regeneration in each group.
Results : PNL 14 days group exhibited less degenerating signs than PNL 42 days group, where
most post-lesion alterations were visualized. Nerve area and minimum diameter were sig-
niﬁcantly lower ( p< 0.05) than control group. PNL 70 days group showed a greater degree of
regenerating ﬁbers and similar morphometric parameters to control group. PNL trained
35 days demonstrated signs of regeneration, reaching control group values in the morpho-
metric analysis.
Discussion : PNL promotes great histopathological changes, which became more visible at 42
post-injury days. A natural nerve-regeneration tendency was observed throughout time, as
observed in PNL 70 days group; nevertheless, moderate swimming training was found to be a
therapeutic resource for nerve regeneration, accelerating such process from a morphoquan-
titative perspective.

Introduction
Chronic pain following either illness or trauma remains a
concerning public health issue. It has been one of the
most frequent causes of health services use and the main
reason of absenteeism, sick leave, early retirement, work-
er’s compensation and low productivity levels [ 1–4].
Neuropathic pain as a result of peripheral nerve lesion
stands as one of the most di ﬃcult types of chronic pain to
be treated due to its complex etiology remains unknown
regarding initiation and maintenance mechanisms [ 5].
Peripheral nerve injury triggers motor and sensorial
abnormalities in the corresponding innervated region
and induces the release of neurotrophic factors in the
aﬀected site [ 6]. These proteins display an essential role in
neural di ﬀerentiation, growth and survival throughout
mammalian development [ 7,8], besides lead toneurogenesis in the adult animal [ 9,10]. Traumatic sciatic
nerve injury in rats triggered a reduction in diameter of
axons, myelinated ﬁbers and their density, as well as in
myelin sheath thickness followed by the increase of endo-
neurial areas in distal and proximal portions of the lesion
[11–14].

iating exercise-induced ne rve regeneration, including
neural growth factor (NGF), insulin-like growth factor
(IGF), ﬁbroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2) and mainly

be outlined [ 16–18]. Furthermore, treadmill aerobic
training as well as balance and coordination exercises
elicited morphological and sensorimotor improvements
after compressive sciatic injury in rats [ 13], an e ﬀect
mediated by neurotrophic factors [ 15].
Swimming can attenuate thermal hyperalgesia and
mechanical allodynia due to chronic compressive nerve
injury [ 19–21]. Extended swimming exercise progres-
sively reversed mechanical allodynia in nerve injury
mice, which lasted for an additional 4 weeks after exercise
interruption. Besides, swimming exercise normalized
nerve injury-induced nerve growth factor and the
enhanced expression of BDNF in the dorsal root ganglion
[21]. However, there is still a lack of consensus about the
most appropriate protocol due to the need of greater
understanding regarding the e ﬀects of swimming in per-
ipheral nerve injuries.
Considering that physical exercise is a non-pharma-
cological and non-invasive method, accessible to all ages,
the present study aims to investigate morphological
alterations caused by partial sciatic nerve ligation, as
well as the e ﬃcacy of a moderate-intensity swimming
training as therapeutic resource for nerve regeneration
through morphoquantitative analysis.
Materials and methods
Animals
The experimental procedures were approved by the
Ethical Committee for Animal Experimentation of
Biological and Health Sciences Center of Paraíba State
University (protocol number 5102042015), and were
conducted according to the ethical guidelines of
Brazilian College of Animal Experimentation [ 22]. The
study used 30 male BALB/c mice, aged 9 –11 weeks and
weighing from 20 g to 30 g. They were housed in standard
polyethylene boxes, under 12:12 h light/dark cycle, in a
temperature-controlled environment (22ºC and 60%
humidity) with food and water ad libidum .
Groups
Mice were divided in ﬁvegroups and randomly
assigned to di ﬀerent groups as follow: control
group, comprising sedentary sham-operated ani-
mals (control group, n= 6); nerve injury animals
submitted to partial sciatic nerve ligation and
remaining in sedentary conditions for 14 (PNL
14 days, n= 6); 42 (PNL 42 days, n=6 ) ;o r
70 days post-lesion (PNL 70 days, n= 6); and
nerve-injured animals submitted to a 5-week
swimming exercise training after 7 days of partial
ligation of the sciatic nerve (PNL trained 35 days,
n= 6). It is important to highlight that PNL
42 days and PNL trained 35 days groups lived
for 42 days after surgery.Neuropathic pain model
The experimental model of neuropathic pain consists
ofa partial unilateral nerve ligation ( Figure 1 )
[23,24]. Surgical procedures were carried out under
anesthesia with a mixture of ketamine (60 mg/kg)
and xylazine (8 mg/kg). Partial nerve injury was
produced by a tight ligature with 8 –0 silk suture
around half of the diameter of the left sciatic nerve,
and skin incisions were closed with stainless steel
staples. Sham surgery involved exposure of the sciatic
nerve, but no ligation was performed.
Exercise protocol
The swimming training consisted of daily sessions in a
glass tank with a 30 cm depth, provided with a heating
system that maintained the water temperature at 32 ± 0.5°
C. A water ﬁlter with a ﬂow capacity of 380 L/h was
adopted to clean the swimming apparatus throughout
each session. The trainings were continuously monitored
to avoid ﬂoating behavior.
Partial nerve ligation leads to mechanical allodynia
and thermal hyperalgesia, which starts 24 –48 h post-
injury and remain for 3 –4 months. The experimental
groups started training 7 days after lesion, which was set
up due to the observation that mechanical and thermal
hypersensitivity were established at that stage [ 21]. The
protocol comprised swimming training once a day for 5
Figure 1. Partial sciatic nerve ligation model.2 A. A. DE MORAES ET AL.
consecutive days followed by 2 resting days over 5 weeks.
PNL trained 35 days group began with a 10-min session
for 3 days and the time was gradually increased by 10 min
every three sessions until the animals swam for 50 min
per session ( Figure 2 ).
Histological procedures
After each experimental protocol, animals were
subcutaneously anesthetized with an association of keta-
mine hydrochloride (60 mg/kg) and xylazine (8 mg/kg).
Thereafter, they were transcardially perfused with phos-
phate-bu ﬀered saline (PBS) 0.05 M at pH 7.3, followed by
aﬁxative mixture of 2% paraformaldehyde and 1% glu-
taraldehyde diluted with 0.1 M PBS at pH 7.3. The
proportion of infusion solution applied in each animal
was established considering a ratio of 1mL/g body weight.
Soon after perfusion, the left sciatic nerve was dis-
sected proximally to the injury. The nerves were
immersed in the same ﬁxative solution and then a 2-h
immersion in phosphate bu ﬀer was carried out. Once it
was done, they were post ﬁxed with osmium tetroxide (1%
diluted in phosphate bu ﬀer at 0.1 M, pH 7.3) for 2 h at
4ºC. The osmium- ﬁxed tissues were dehydrated in
increasing acetone series, aligned and embedded in
Araldite® blocks to ensure ﬁber layer cross-section.
Transversal slices (0.5 µm) were stained with 1%
T o l u i d i n eb l u et ob ep o s t e r i o r l ya n a l y z e d .
Morphological and morphometric analysis
An optical microscope (Olympus BX 41-BF) coupled to
animage-analysis system (Image Pro-Plus v6.2 software
–Media Cybernetics) was employed for the analysis.
The morphological analysis assessed myelinated and
unmyelinated ﬁbers, interstitial space, besides endoneur-
ial connective tissue, to detect any sign of structural
damage and abnormal patterns of myelination in the
sciatic nerve, as well as any typical histological sign of
injury and the e ﬀect of swimming training.
A morphometric analysis was carried out to estimate
cross-section area and minimum diameter of the sciatic
nerve.Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad
Prism 5.01 software and data were presented as
mean ± standard error of the mean. One-way analysis
of variance (ANOVA) was carried out followed by
post-hoc Turkey ’s test for multiple comparisons. In
each case, signi ﬁcance was set to p< 0.05.
Results
Morphological analysis
Control group demonstrated a bimodal ﬁberspectrum,
encompassing large and small axonal ﬁbers. Myelinated
ﬁbers presented with circular or ovoid pro ﬁle, being
connect to each other through a scanty space of endo-
neurial connective tissue, where clusters of unmyelinated
ﬁbers were placed ( Figures 3(a )a n d 4(a)).
Examinations of PNL 14 days group ’sc r o s s - s e c t i o n s
demonstrated nerve swelling areas with linear appearance
(Figure 3(b )). The distribution of small and large nerve
ﬁbers, as well as the proportion between the myelin
sheath thickness and ﬁber size remained regular.
Nevertheless, their myelin sheath exhibited atypical bor-
ders, such as lobulated and triangular, contrasting with
control group. Histological features of endoneurial con-
nective tissue were preserved, as well as unmyelinated
ﬁbers conglomerates ( Figure 4(b )).
After 42 days post-injury, the edema presented with
diﬀuse appearance ( Figure 3(c )). Moreover, an increased
interstitial space between ﬁbers was evident, suggesting
interstitial ﬂuid accumulation. As a result, ﬁbers were
dispersed rather than connected by endoneurium and
small ﬁber clusters became less noticeable. Axonal ﬁbers
remained irregular-shaped. Further analysis indicates
that the nerve showed a considerable level of damage,
evidenced by the presence of degenerating axons and
degeneration debris is evident ( Figure 4(c )).
Seventy days after lesion, it was observed a reduced
nerve swelling and perceptible transition to circular
or ovoid-shaped myelin sheath in sedentary animals.
Besides degenerated axonal ﬁbers, regenerating ones
could also be recognized due to its thin myelin sheath.
Figure 2. Protocol for moderate-intensity swimming exercise. Seven days after partial sciatic nerve ligation, animals were
submitted to swimming training once a day for 5 consecutive days followed by 2 resting days over 5 weeks. The swimming
training time gradually increased from 10 to 50 min per session. Overall, the animals were submitted to 25 training sessions;
wherein, the ﬁrst 12 sessions they swan for 10, 20, 30 and 40 min each three sessions, respectively. After that, 13 sessions of 50-
min swimming training were carried out.NEUROLOGICAL RESEARCH 3
A visible increment on number of small ﬁbers clusters
and endoneurial connective tissue was identi ﬁed, sug-
gesting a regenerating proc ess in the injured sciatic
nerve ( Figures 3(d )a n d 4(d)).
The trained group, which was euthanized 42 days
post-injury, exhibited swelling nerve areas with a linear
aspect ( Figure 3(e )). In contrast to PNL 42 days group,
axonal ﬁbers are grouped and connected through endo-
neurial tissue. Regarding myelin sheath pro ﬁles, small
ﬁbers were irregular-shaped ; whereas, large myelinated
ones looked similar to control group, and a regular pro-
portion between axon diameter and myelin sheath thick-
ness was noticeable ( Figure 4(e )). Such qualitative datasuggest that sciatic regeneration was in process at that
stage. It is also important to highlight the fact that none of
the groups evidenced any sign of perineurial damage.
Morphometric analysis
Animals submitted to sciatic nerve injury demonstrated
lower area ( Figure 5 ) and minimum diameters ( Figure 6 )
of cross-sections as compared to control group. The
histological evolution of the lesion exhibited a downward
trend until 42 days post-injury; therefore, area ( Figure 5
(a)) and minimum diameter ( Figure 6(a )) values signi ﬁ-
cantly ( p< 0.05) reduced in PNL 42 days group. Although

such as lobulated and triangular, can be observed in PNL 14 days and PNL 42 days group. A regeneration process is evident in
PNL 70 days group, indicated by the transition to myelin sheath circular shape and presence of small ﬁbers clusters. This process
seemed complete in the trained group, which presented similar morphological aspects to control group.4 A. A. DE MORAES ET AL.
PNL 70 days group attained higher results than the pre-
vious group, such values did not reach control group.

signiﬁcant ( p< 0.05) decrease in both analyzed factors;
whereas, PNL trained 35 days reached control group
values.
Discussion
The present study aimed to evaluate the e ﬀects of
swimming training on the morphological alterations
in the sciatic nerve following partial sciatic ligation, aswell as the histological evolution of the nerve lesion
over a 70-day period.
Despite numerous exercise protocols have been
carried out to elucidate their e ﬀects on peripheral
nerve regeneration [ 3,4,11–13,24,25], there is still
no consensus regarding which exercise modality
and parameters –i.e. exercise intensity, duration
and frequency –are the most appropriate for indu-
cing neural improvements. F urthermore, few studies
have examined the e ﬀect of swimming on peripheral
neuropathies.
Besides, the rodent experimental partial sciatic
ligation mimics the complex human neuropathic
pain syndrome [ 23] and promotes cellular morpho-
logical details identical to human nerve [ 26]; thus,
being a reliable model to be examined.

over time. All sedentary animals submitted to partial nerve ligation exhibited lower areas in comparison to control group. The
area values presented with a downward pattern until 42 days post-injury, being PNL 42 days group values signi ﬁcantly reduced
(p< 0.05) when compared to baseline. Although a natural regeneration trend was observed at 70 days post-injury, as can be
noted in PNL 70 days group results, control group values were not achieved at such post-lesion time. (b) Swimming exercise
increased area values in PNL trained 35 days group when compared to PNL 42 days group, thus overcoming control group
values. It is important to highlight that both experimental groups presented with the same post-lesion time, because the
training was started 7 days after the injury.

compared to control group. The minimum diameters presented with a downward pattern until 42 days post-injury, being PNL
42 days group values signi ﬁcantly reduced ( p< 0.05) when compared to baseline. Although PNL 70 days group attained higher
values than PNL 42 days group, control group values were not attained at such post-lesion time. (b) Swimming exercise
increased minimum diameter values in PNL trained 35 days group when compared to PNL 42 days group, thus reaching control
group values. It is important to highlight that both experimental groups presented with the same post-lesion time, because the

Sciatic nerve morphological changes after lesion
Ourﬁndings reveal that partial nerve ligation leads to
visible histopathological alterations. At 14 days post-
injury, morphological damage is not so apparent,
characterized only by central interstitial edema and
slight distortions in myelin sheaths. The most evident
morphological changes were observed in sedentary
animals at 42 days post-lesion, in which irregularly
contoured nerve ﬁbers with distortions in their mye-
lin sheaths, as well as di ﬀuse edema and decreased
minimum cross-sectional diameter of the sciatic
nerve were identi ﬁed. On the other hand, when
70 days were elapsed following the lesion, nerve ﬁbers
presented with more regular and rounded contours,
besides morphometric parameters were quite similar
to the control group, suggesting a spontaneous regen-
erative process, though still incomplete.
One factor that may have contributed to the mor-
phological changes over the 70 post-lesion days is the
potential circulatory alterations as a result of the
mechanical compression of the sciatic nerve, which
could possibly lead to circulation disturbances and
subsequent in ﬂammatory responses [ 27]. It was pre-
viously reported that prolonged and intense compres-
sions may lead to axonal injury, protein exudation,
nerve ﬁbrosis, intraneural edema as well as increased
hydraulic pressure [ 28], which might have promoted
distortions in myelin sheath contours in our study.
The post-injury time may also play a role in
underlying morphological changes following nerve
lesion. The ﬁndings reported by Possamai et al. did
not show great histopathological alterations in prox-
imal stumps after axonotmesis of the sciatic nerve in
rats. However, the longest post-lesion survival time
was 29 days [ 29], in contrast to our PNL 42 days and
PNL 70 days groups, where most visible changes were
recorded.
Ilha et al . reported similar morphological results
regarding sciatic crush lesion in rats, where proximal
and distal stumps were analyzed after 42 days follow-
ing nerve injury [ 11]. At the distal portion of the
regenerating sciatic nerve, great signs of degeneration
were observed; whereas, the histological features of
the proximal stump were more discrete when com-
pared to the distal one [ 11]. Thus, it is important to
consider that proximal and distal stumps develop
responses to injury as previously reported in the
literature [ 30]. Therefore, the present study focused
on assessing morphological and morphometric
changes in proximal stump of the lesion, where
usually occurs a backward degeneration up to the
ﬁrst node of Ranvier, followed by the elaboration of
multiple daughter axons [ 31]. In contrast to the ﬁnd-
ings of the proximal stump reported by Ilha et al .
[11], our analysis identi ﬁed that at 42 days post-
injury important alterations in morphology andmorphometry of the nerve were found. Such diver-
gence might be explained by di ﬀerences in the type of
lesion.
Sciatic nerve morphometric changes after partial
ligation
The analyzed morphometric parameters over the
post-lesion period presented with the same pattern:
a downward trending until the 42ndday, followed by
increased values in the 70thday, though they did not
attain control group means. Such ﬁndings suggest
that a nerve degeneration process might proceed
even at 42 days post-lesion, indicating that e ﬀective
regenerative mechanisms start afterward. This might
be associated to the fact that following peripheral
nerve lesion, a combination of molecular and cellular
events, collectively designated as Wallerian degenera-
tion, is triggered distally to the injury as well as
within a small reactive portion at the proximal
stump, culminating in axonal degeneration [ 32].
A cellular outgrowth occurs from proximal nerve
stump, where several axonal sprouts are released
toward the basal lamina tubes from the Schwann
cells of the distal portion to re-establish innervation
[33]. Several agents are involved in nerve degeneration
and subsequent regeneration to modulate these pro-
cesses, e.g. previous studies indicated that apart from
providing support structure to regenerating ﬁbers,
Schwann cells stimulate the release of neurotrophic
factors [ 34]; Macrophages, besides removing degenera-
tion debris, usually release interleukin-1 β(IL-1 β),
which triggers the secretion of growth factors [ 35,36].
Additionally, plastic alterations in central nervous sys-
tem after peripheral nerve injury may activate lower
motor neurons, promoting the increase in neurotro-
phins synthesis [ 4]. How these factors combined with
further mechanisms work in peripheral nerve injuries
is not well elucidated; especially, regarding the nerve
repair after partial sciatic nerve ligation.
Another possible factor associated to the pattern
investigated in the morphometric analysis is the
reduced viscoelasticity properties of the nerve; thus,
an increased collagenation, endoneural retraction and
rigidity are installed in nerve boundaries [ 37,38]. This
allows external forces to a ﬀect the inner portion of
the nerve [ 37], leading to a reduced diameter.
A critical ﬁnding in this study is related to the
beneﬁts of swimming exercise training on the
changes caused by partial nerve lesion. All morpho-
quantitative parameters indicated regenerated ﬁbers
in PNL trained 35 days group, as compared to seden-
tary animals. Additionally, the di ﬀerences between
PNL trained 35 days animals and PNL 42 days
group suggest a faster regenerative process in the
animals submitted to swimming exercise [ 25].6 A. A. DE MORAES ET AL.
Exercise therapy on nerve regeneration
Conﬂi cting results regarding the potential bene ﬁts or
deleterious e ﬀects of exercise therapy on nerve regen-
eration have been described. The protocol speci ﬁca-
tions, i.e. intensity, duration and modality, as well as
the exercise startpoint after injury were found to be
critical aspects for rehabilitation therapy. The present
study set out 7 days after surgery as the exercise start-
point to ensure a postsurgical recovery time.
Furthermore, at such time, animals exhibited mechan-
ical allodynia and thermal hypersensitivity [ 21]; thus,
indicating an established neuropathic pain syndrome.
Regarding the intensity of exercise protocols, dis-
tinct exertion levels of exercise may in ﬂuence nerve-
associated cells, such as macrophages and Schwann
cells [ 25,39]. Additionally, although endurance exer-
cise triggered bene ﬁcial e ﬀects after nerve injury,
when combined with resistance training, it might
delay functional recovery of sciatic nerve [ 11].
Swimming, as a complex endurance exercise, might
participate in the modulation of in ﬂammatory responses
on the injured tissue [ 25], leading to increased reinner-
vation and axonal sprouting [ 40]. Our results are in line
with previous studies where endurance training was
largely associated with regeneration after an experimen-
tal traumatic nerve injury [ 11,25]. A previous study
carried out by our group demonstrated that the same
swimming protocol was capable of normalizing nerve
injury-induced up-regulation of NGF and BDNF in
dorsal root ganglion, which was not only associated to
neuropathic pain reduction [ 21], but also to a faster
peripheral nerve regeneration [ 41].
Taken together, our data raised strong evidences
that swimming training played an important role in
nerve regeneration after partial ligation. Moreover,
additional studies are required to investigate further
molecular and systemic events underlying the pre-
sented swimming protocol, and the e ﬀect of exercise-
dependent neurotrophic factors on nerve regeneration
Conclusion
In summary, our data evidence that partial sciatic nerve
ligation promotes signi ﬁcant histopathological changes,
which became more visible at 42 post-injury days. At
70 days, nerve repair seemed to occur, though still
incomplete. Most importantly, moderate swimming
training was found to be an important therapeutic
alternative for nerve regeneration, accelerating such
process from a morphoquantitative perspective.
