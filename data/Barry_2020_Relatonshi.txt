Training Load and Pain, Injury and Illness in Competitive Swimming  
 2 ABSTRACT  
Background: Research suggests that the f requency of training, combined with the repetitive motion involved in 
high volume swimming can predispos e swimmers to symptoms of over -training. The prevention of pain, injury 
and illness  is of paramount importance in  competitive swimming  in order to maximise a swimmer’s  ability to 
train and perform consistently. A significant factor in the prevention of pain, injury or illness is the appropriate 
load monitoring  and management  practices within a  training programme.  
Objective: The purpose of this systematic review is to investigate the relationship  between  training load and pain, 
injury or i llness in competitive swimmers.  
Methods: The databases SPORTDiscus, CI NAHL, Scopus, MEDLINE and Embase were  searched in accordance 
with PRISMA guidelines. Studies were included if they report ed on competitive swimmers and analyse d the link 
between training load and either pain,  injury or illness . The methodological quality and study bias was assessed 
using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist .   
Results: The s earch retrieved 1,959 articl es, 15 of which were  included for review. The critical appraisal process  
indicated study quality was poor overall . Pain was the most explored condition (N=12), with injury (N=2) and 
illness (N=1) making up the remain ing articles . There was no evidence of an association  between training load 
and pain , while t here may be  some evidence to  suggest a relationship between training load and injury or illness.   
Conclusions : The relationship between training load and pain, injury or illness is unclear owing to a host of 
methodological constraints . The review highlight ed that youth, master ’s and competitive swimmers of a lower 
ability  (e.g. club versus international)  may need particular consideration  when planning training loads . Winter 
periods, higher intensity  sessions  and speed elements may also need to be programmed with care. Monitoring  
practices need to be developed in conjunction with consensus guidelines, with the inclusion of internal training 
loads being a priority.  Future research  should focus on longitudinal prospective studies , utili sing the session  
Rating of Perceived Exertion  (sRPE) monitoring method and investigating the applicability  of Acute/Chronic 
Workload Ratio  (ACWR)  and exponentially weighted moving  average  (EWMA) .  Improved methods  and study 
design  will provide further clarity on the relationship between load and pain, injury, and illness.

Training Load and Pain, Injury and Illness in Competitive Swimming  
 3 1. BACKGROUND  
 
Aquatic sports were  one of the original sports in the modern Olympic Games , and have since grown to  have the 
second highest athlete participation , with 900 competitive swimmers participating at the 2016 Rio Olympic  Games  
(Rio 2016 - Swimming | FINA.Org - Official FINA Website , n.d.) . In competitive swimmers, injury prevalence 
ranges from 32.2% to 74.6%, with the shoulder accounting for a large proportion of injuries, followed by knee 
and lower back  injuries  (Toomey et al., 2018) . The incidence of overuse injuries (1.48) surpass  that of acute 
injuries (1.10), when adjusted per 1000 exposure hours  in competitive swimmers  (Ristolainen et al., 2010) . 
Despite 81% of Olympic swimming e vents being contested in under two minutes and twenty seconds, the 
traditional training practices of competitive swimmers are high in  volume (F. Nugent et al., 2019) . The extensive 
nature of training means there is a significantly higher incidence of injury in training than in competition (Soligard 
et al., 2017) . An abundance of research suggests that the high frequency of training (Weldon & Richardson, 2001) , 
as well as the repetitive motion (Pink & Tibone, 2000)  can predispose swimmers to symptoms  of overtraining 
(Khodaee et al., 2016) . Overtraining is defined as the accumulation of training or non -training stress resulting i n 
a long term decrement in performance capacity  (Lehmann et al., 1999) . Overtraining can often have  related  
physiological  signs and symptoms of  prolonged  maladaptation  (Meeusen et al., 2006) , leadin g to disturbances  in 
the endocrine,  immune,  musculoskeletal  and neurologic  systems  (Myrick, 2015) .  
 
Prevention of pain, injury and illness is of paramount importance within elite sport, not only to safeguard the long -
term health of the athlete , but to maximi se their ability to train and perform without interruption (Palmer -Green 
et al., 2013) . Finding a balance between trainin g load and recovery is crucial in the prevention of overtraining  
(Kenttä & Hassmén, 1998) . To this end, the dose -response relationship needs to be monitored. While the respons e 
aspect of this paradigm is more  easily  measured, the dose imposes more logistical challenges  (Lam bert & 
Borresen, 2010) . The incidence of injury in swimming is seen as being low in comparison to other sports,  but the 
prevalence of overuse injuries is high (Matsuura et al., 2019) . This further emphasises the importance of load 
monitoring among elite swimmers (Pollock et al., 2019) , and also quantification of the training load in order to 
identif y the effects of training (Mujika, 2017) . Training load can be divided into internal and external loads, with 
external loads describ ing the quantification of work and internal loads describing the response to that work (Drew 
& Finch, 2016) . In swimming, distance, time or speed are habitually used to monitor the external training load, 
with heart rate typica lly used to monitor internal training load (García -Ramos et al., 2015) . A range of other 
Training Load and Pain, Injury and Illness in Competitive Swimming  
 4 methods such as self -administered questionnaires, sport -specific performance test and blood screening have been  
used as methods to reduce the risk of overtraining (Pollock et al., 2019) .  
 
The links between various measures of training load and either pain, injury or illness has been examined across a 
variety of sports (Eckard et al. , 2018; Johnston et al., 2019; Jones et al., 2017) . While training load, pain, injury 
and illness have become key terms within sport science, a lack of consistency in their definitions has also arisen 
(Jones et al ., 2017) . The rise to prominence of training load monitoring (Newton et al., 2019)  and injury 
surveillance (Palmer -Green et al., 2013)  practices over the past decade  has seen a subsequent increase in the need 
for consensus statements. Sports such as, cricket, football, rugby union, rugby league, tennis, athletics and horse 
racing have all published epidemiological consensus statements in recent years (Roald Bahr et al., 2020) . Many 
of these statements attempt to improve consistency in reporting guidelines to enable the comparison of 
methodologies and findings.  A consensus stat ement from  Fédération Internationale de Natation ( FINA ) in 2016  
(Mountjoy et al., 2016) , provided clari ty on the report ing of  injuries and illness in aquatic sports , but neglected to 
address  the monitoring of training load within the sport  and its links with injury surveillance. In the same year, 
Drew and Finch (Drew & Finch, 2016)  published a systematic review investigating the relationship between 
training load, and injury, illness and soreness  in a broad range of sports . The review categorised injury and illness 
into medical attention and time  loss definitions, while it also expanded into the area of overuse injuries. The term 
soreness in this review was identified as the prevalence of symptoms irrespective of medical attention or time 
loss. Including this term broadened the reviews focus to papers that may incorporate ‘athlete ’s self-reported  
injury’ (soreness or pain)  as recommended by the Injury Definitions Concept Framework  (Drew & Finch, 2016; 
Timpka et al., 2015) . The review  concluded that there is moderate evidence of a relationship between training and 
competition load and the incidence of injury,  illness  and soreness . Their findings highlighted that training load 
should be monitored, using sRPE to avoid acute spikes in load (Drew & Finch, 2016) . This review included 35 
studies ; however, only one swimming paper me t the inclusion criteria. More recently, a  systema tic review 
completed by Feijen et al. (Feijen et al., 2020)  investigated the link between swim training volume and shoul der 
pain. The review encompassed 12 studies and highlighted that swim training volume was associated with shoulder 
pain in adolescent competitive swimmers. While the review provided worthwhile information, several limitations  
were acknowledged . The review solely focused on measures of external training load ( i.e. volume) and limited 
the scope to shoulder pain. The I nternational Olympic Committee  (IOC)  consensus statement s on load in sport 
Training Load and Pain, Injury and Illness in Competitive Swimming  
 5 and risk of injury (Soligard et al., 2016) , and risk of illness (Schwellnus et al., 2016)  have stated injury aetiology 
is multifactorial and that load m onitoring  need s to include a combination  of both external and internal  loads.   
 
To date, no review  has completed a comprehensive assessment  on the  relationship between internal an d external 
training load and pain, injury , or illness in competitive swimming. This review  aims to provide a clear consensus 
for practitioners working within competitive swimming on the relationship between training load and pain, injury,  
and illness. Using the most recent guidelines on training load and injury/illness surveillance , it is intended to close 
a gap within the literature in competitive swimming as other sports have done in recent years. Consequently, t he 
purpose of this systematic review is to determine if a relationship exists between training load and pain, injury or 
illness in competitive swimmers .  
Training Load and Pain, Injury and Illness in Competitive Swimming  
 6 2. METHODS  
2.1. Literature Search  
The search strategy followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta -Analysis (PRISMA) 
Guidelines (PRISMA -P Group et al., 2015) . The keyword search string included combinations of the following: 
Training Load, Swimming, Competitive, Injury, Pain, Illness. Each keyword was broken into its individual  
Medical Su bject Headings  (MeSH), terms or synonyms and joined where appropriate by Bolan terms “AND”/ 
“OR”. A copy of the keyword search string is provided in the  electronic supplementary material .   Relevant 
studies were then identified through running the keyword string through five targeted databases: SPORTDiscus, 
CINAHL, Scopus, MEDLINE and Embase .  
 
2.2. Selection Criteria  
Once the search was conducted, results were fil tered for English l anguage with in each database. No date limits 
were applied. Remaining results were then stored on a reference managem ent tool  (Zotero.org) for manual 
screening . Using the reference management tool, duplicate s were removed , and titles were initially screened for 
relevan ce to the subject matter by a single reviewer ( LB). Articles clearly outside the scope of this review were 
excluded. Titles and abstracts were then screened for the inclusion criteria by two reviewers  (LB, TC). Articles 
were segregated into “YES”, “NO”, “M AYBE” folders according to their eligibility.  
 
The following inclusion criteria had to be present in order f or the study to be considered: 1 ) the study had to be 
printed in the English langua ge in a peer -reviewed journal and excluded case study, case series, reviews, 
interv entions, conference proceedings and study designs; 2 ) the method of the study had to clarify that participa nts 
were competitive swimmers;  3) one or more measures of internal or external tra ining load had to be reported; 4 ) 
an outcome  measure of pain, injury or illness had to be reported , which could  be self -reported or diagnosed by a 
health professional; and 5) a statistical analysis of the difference or association between training load and pain, 
injury or illness had to be reported.   
 
Full text cop ies of both the “YES” and “MAYBE ” articles were sourced and rescreened for inclusion. A 
comparison of both reviewers’ results was made with a third independent reviewer  (ML) acting as adjudicator in 
the event of a disagreement. Once consensus was reached, a full search for additional papers of the final articles 
reference lists was carried out. Any articles sourced through secondary means (e.g. reference list search , etc.) , 
Training Load and Pain, Injury and Illness in Competitive Swimming  
 7 were screened by both reviewers and included where appropriate. Figure 1 presents a flow chart diagram of the 
systematic search process.  
 
2.3. Data Extraction  
Key information pertaining to the inclusion criteria w ere extracted from each study,  using a standard data 
collection form. Study design, population characteristics ( i.e. number of participants, level of ability, sex  and age), 
training load measured (internal or external), outcome (measure of pain, injury, illness), method of collection for 
both training l oad and outcome, definition of outcome used, key results or findings were extracted. If any key 
information was not available, the corresponding author was contacted. If no response was rec eived after a period 
of six  weeks, the information was deemed unava ilable. Findings included those that tested for significant 
difference ( p-values between groups) as well as those that tested for an association (Odds Ratios between exposure 
and outcome).  The data extraction table was cross -checked for accuracy by a second reviewer  (TC). Studies were 
grouped by outcome for comparison purposes.  
 
2.4. Training Load Measures  
Internal and external training load measures were defined and extracted based on Eckard et al.  (Eckard et al., 
2018) . Internal training load  was defined as the athlete’s response to an external stimulus  (e.g. RPE , heart rate 
(HR) , etc.) . External training load w as defined as any external stimulus applied to the athlete independent of their 
athlete characteristics  (e.g. distance , time, etc.)  (Eckard et al., 2018) . Method of collection was designated as 
either being self -reported (SR) when the athlete  themselves  record ed the load , or “third party” when the load data 
was collected and reported by a designated person within the coaching or research team.  
 
2.5. Operational Outcome Definition  
The definition used for pain, injury or illness was extracted  and categorised where possible  according to Mountjoy 
et al . (Mountjoy et al., 2016)  and Langhout et al . (Langhout et al., 2019) . Pain, injury or illness could be 
catego rised as “non -time loss” (NTL ), “medical attention” (MA) or “time loss” (TL). Medical attention  is where 
a qualified clinician has assessed the athlete ’s medical condition (Mountjoy et al., 2016) , TL was defined as one 
which led to the athlete being unable to participate in full FINA activities  (Mountjoy et al., 2016) , and NTL was 
any physical complaint as a result of competition or training  but without time -loss (Langhout et al., 2019) .

2.6. Critical Appraisal  
The Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal Checklists for cohort  and cross-sectional studies w ere utilised 
to assess the risk of bias for each individual study as relevant to their study design  (Joanna Briggs Institute, 2019) . 
Two reviewers (LB, TC) individually cr itically appraised 15 studies (10  cross -sectional, 5  cohorts ). Each tool 
included between 8 -11 questions with a focus on the appropriateness of the study design, presence of selection 
bias, validity and reliability of methods, the handling of confounding factors and appropriate ness of the statistical 
analys es used. Authors assigned a “Yes”, “No”, “Unclear” or “Not Applicable” to each question , depending on 
the perceived risk of bias. Study quality was considered poor if they had ≥3 “no” or “unclear” responses  as outlined 
in Nour  et al. (Nour et al., 2018) . Discrepancies between the two reviewers were resolved through d iscussion and 
a third party (CP) was consulted in the event an agreement could not be reached.

An online systematic search retrieved 1,959 articles across five databases, 803 of which were duplicates. Initial 
screening o f titles and abstracts excluded 996 articles, leaving 160 full text articles to be assessed. The original 
database search uncovered 10 articles which met the inclusion criteria, with a further 5 articles being included 
from secondary sources . A total of 15  articles were i ncluded for review; 5 cohort and 10  cross -sectional study 
designs . An outcome of pain was the most explored condition (N=12), with injury (N=2) and illness (N=1) making 
up the remainder of the articles.  
 
3.1. Critical Appraisal  
The overall study quality was poor, with ten (Capaci et al., 2002; de Almeida et al., 2015; Harrington et al., 
2014; Hellard et al., 2015; Krüger et al., 2012; Martins et al., 2018; Ristolainen et al., 2014; Tate et al., 2012; 
Tomar & Allen, 2019; Walker et al., 2012)  of the fifteen studies scoring ≥3 in the “no” or “unclear” categories.  
Tessaro et al. (Tessaro et al., 2017)  was the only study to receive a positive  appraisal in all eight categories, while 
Krüger et al. (Krüger et al., 2012)  had the most “no” or “unclear” responses.  A consistent weakness of all the 
studies was related to managing confounding factors. Twelve studies identified  confounding factors, but only six 
(Capaci et al., 2002; Harrington et al., 2014; Hellard et al., 2015; Martins et al., 2018; Tate et al., 2012; Walker 
et al., 2012)  outlined  a strategy to deal with them. Strategies  included excluding participants who participat ed in 
additional sports or  who had a previous surgery an area of interest . In the cross -sectional studies , all reported 
sufficient detail regarding the population and setting . The exposure and outcome were measured in a valid and 
reliable way in 2 7% and 67 % of all studies. This highlighted that the method of monitoring exposure was a 
common limitation within the study design, most of which rel ied on self-reported questionnaire s. Statistical 
analysis were conducted in an appropriate manner in 8 7% of all studies.  Table 2 presents the JBI quality checklist 
information for each of the included studies .  
 
3.2. Participant Demographics  
A total of 1510 swimmers were included in the review with 11% of them categorised as elite  (Hellard et al., 2015; 
Hidalgo -Lozano et al., 2012, 2013; Martins et al., 2018) , 36% club level (Capaci et al., 2002; Cejudo et al., 2019; 
Su et al., 2004; Tate et al., 2012;  Tessaro et al., 2017; Walker et al., 2012) , 23% master ’s level (Krüger et al., 
2012; Tate et al., 2012) , 3% collegiate (Harrington et al., 2014; Tomar & Allen, 2019)  and 27% national level (de 
Almeida et al., 2015; Ristolainen et al., 2014) . The  mean age range was 8 -49.5 years , with two studies not 
Training Load and Pain, Injury and Illness in Competitive Swimming  
 11 reporting age for one group , or all of their participants ’ demographics  (Tate et al., 2012; Tomar & Allen, 2019) . 
A variety of descriptors outlining participant’s level of ability, including average training distance and hours per 
week were recorded in the majority of circumstances. Large range training volume s in kilometres per week (25  - 
58 km/w eek) or hours per week ( 4 – 24 hours/week ) were reported. Ten studies reported results from both male 
and female participants, while one study reported solely on male participants (Capaci et al., 2002)  and two studies 
on female participants  (Harrington et al., 2014; Tate et al., 2012) . Two  studies did not disclose the gender balance 
of their participants (Hidalgo -Lozano et al., 2013; Walker et al.,  2012) .

 14 3.3. Operational Outcome Definition  
The definition of pain, injury and illness varied amongst the fifteen studies. Of the two injury based studies, one 
of the definitions required a restriction of training (Tomar & Allen, 2019) , with the second specifically focused 
on overuse injuries, outlining a definition with elements of TL and MA criteria (Ristolainen et al., 2014) . 
Regarding illness, the definition provided was based on  Fricker et al.  (Fricker et al., 2005)  and require d the athlete 
to have received MA and TL away from training. Out of the three categories of pain, injury and illness, studies 
investigating pain used the  most diverse definitions. Three studies utilised a Numerical Pain Rating Scale (NPRS)  
(Hidalgo -Lozano et al., 2012, 2013; Tessaro et al., 2017)  with two reporting  a set threshold of 4/10 on the NPRS 
to denote significant pain (Hidalgo -Lozano et al., 2012, 2013) . The remaining study did not provide a  set threshold 
on the scale (Tessaro et al., 2017) .  Subscales from the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) 
questionnaire and the Penn Shoulder Score (PSS) were combined to form the Sports and Sym ptom Survey Form 
utilised in two of the studies (Harrington et al., 2014; Tate et al., 2012) . A set injury definition  (McMaster WC et 
al., 1998)  was used in two studies (Cejudo et al., 2019; Walker et al., 2012)  which classified significant interfering 
shoulder pain (SIP) as a pain that interfered with training or competition, or progression in training and caused a 
cessation or modification of training or racing. A 1 -5 pain scale was used in one study which indicated if the 
participant had no pain at level 1 , up to pain preventing competitive swimming at level 5 (Capaci et al., 2002) . A 
mixed MA/TL definition was employed in one study (de Almeida et al., 2015) , which referred to the consensus 
statement of  Fuller (Fuller, 2006) . A clinical assessment or screening process was conducted in two of the studies 
(Hidalgo -Lozano et al., 2013; Su et al., 2004)  in conjunction with a s et definition. Martins et al. (Martins et al., 
2018)  did not provide a definition of pain but highlighted that a questionnaire which evaluated the occurrence of 
pain was administered. Pain was present if the responder answered “yes” to a question  on the presence of pain. 
Similarly, Krüger et al. (Krüger et al., 2012)  did not provide a set definition of pain but outlined that a retrospective 
questionnaire was used to determine the incidence of shoulder pain  over a three -year period.  
 
3.4. Monitoring Training Load  
All the papers included for review collected external training load , using one or more variations . Session duration 
was the most commonly used unit of load . Nine out of fifteen studies employed this approach  and was most often 
recorded as hours per week.  This was closely followed by session  distance,  which was collected in eight studies , 
most of which was recorded as kilometres per week. Finally, session fr equency was collected in five studies  with 
practices per week being most frequent. Two out of fifteen studies collected internal training  load, with session 
Training Load and Pain, Injury and Illness in Competitive Swimming  
 15 intensity recorded through the use of  sRPE (Tomar & Allen, 2019)  and blood lactate concentration (Hellard et 
al., 2015) . The method of colle cting training load data was reported well in the majority of cases. However, one 
study (Hidalgo -Lozano et al., 2012)  collected training load as hours/week but did not report the method of data 
collection. Another study  report ed how the internal training load  (blood lactate profile)  was collected , but not the 
external training load measure  (meters/ week)  (Hellard et al., 2015) . Training load data w ere collected subjectively 
through athlete self -reporting, generally through the use of a questionnaire. A third party was used to submit the 
data in two instances (Tessaro et al., 2017; Walker et al., 2012) , namely  the coach, clinician or research assistant . 
 
 
3.5. Relationship Between Training Load and Pain, Injury , and Illness  
Eleven of the fifteen studies stated no statistically significant differences or associations between a measurement 
of training load and the outcome reported (Cejudo et al., 2019; de Almeida et al. , 2015; Harrington et al., 2014; 
Hidalgo -Lozano et al., 2012, 2013; Martins et al., 2018; Su et al., 2004; Tate et al., 2012; Tessaro et al., 2017; 
Tomar & Allen, 2019; Walker et al., 2012) . In the remaining studies, a statistically significant differen ce was 
reported betwe en training load and injury (Ristolainen et al., 2014)  and pain  (Capaci et al., 2002) . A positive 
association w as seen between training load and illness  (Hellard et al., 2015) , while  a negative association  was 
reported between train ing load and pain  (Krüger et al., 2012) .  
 
Two out of twelve studies found a  statistical difference or association between tr aining load and pain  (Capaci et 
al., 2002; K rüger et al., 2012) . Both studies reported contrasting conclusions with Capaci et al.  (Capaci e t al., 
2002)  highlighting that swimmers experiencing musculoskeletal pain reported swimming  significantly (p <0.05) 
more hours per week than those without pain  (8.86±1.25 vs 8.00±1.06 hours/week) . This finding  contradicted 
Krüger et al.  (Krüger et al., 2012)  who suggested that tho se swimming lower volumes (0 -4,999  meters/week), 
were 2.8 times more likely to develop shoulder pain. The remaining ten studies that reported on the relationship 
between training load and pain showed no significant difference or association.  
 
Two studies  investigated the relationship between training load and injury  (Ristolainen et al., 2014; Tomar & 
Allen, 2019) . Ristolainen et al.  (Ristolainen et al., 2014)  found a positive relationship , and reported that the mean 
number of kilometres sw am per year was significantly higher in injured swimmers , when compared to non-injured 
swimmers (1612  km/year vs. 1380  km/year, p=0.04 ). The second study reported no significant relationship 
Training Load and Pain, Injury and Illness in Competitive Swimming  
 16 between  training load  (r = -0.35) , training monotony  (r = 0.62) , training strain  (r = -0.12)  or Acute/Chronic 
Workload Ratio  (ACWR)  (r = 0.08)  and the incidence of injury (Tomar & Allen, 2019) . 
 
The risk of illn ess (i.e. Upper Respiratory Tract and Pulmonary Infections (URTPI )) was significantly higher  (p 
= 0.0244)  during high load training periods, while the odds of having a URTPI was 70% and 50% higher during 
intensive training periods than both taper and competition periods , respectively  (Hellard et al., 2015) . High load 
workouts at maximal speed  (blood lactate ≥ 10mmo·L-1) contributed considerably to the increased risk (not 
specified) of URTPI. While the authors highlighted that t he risks of URTPI were higher for swimmers during the 
winter months, they also specified that national swimmers were generally more at risk th an international level 
swimmers  despite similarities in age and training prescription. This may be explained by a superior genetic 
resistance response to infection or improved athletic lifestyle management by international swimmers, or a lower 
training load threshold by national level s wimmers (Hellard et al., 2015) .

 21 4. DISCUSSION  
The aim of this systematic review was to investigate the relati onsh ip between training load  and pain, injury , or 
illness in competitive swimmers. A clear lack of consistency within the findings was evident, with conflicting 
results being presented and many methodological limitations preventing a ccurate comparison of r esults. This lack 
of consistent reporting prevented a meta -analysis of the result s been conducted . There is no clear evidence of a 
relationship  between training load and pain, with the majority of studies reporting no statistical difference or 
association between those with pain and their exposure to external training loads. This link would require further 
investigation using prospective study de signs and coupling of both in ternal and external training load to get a 
more accurate representation. There is limited  evidence to  suggest a relationship between training load and injury 
with one study  finding swimming more distance  (km)  in the past year i ncreased the risk of injury  (Ristolainen et 
al., 2014) . This relationship would need to be investigated further with both internal and external training loads 
being used to accurately measure training load. There is also limited evidence for the relationship between training 
load and illness based on the work of Hellard  et al.  (Hellard et al., 2015) ; however, this needs further rigorous 
investigation in multiple swimming populations.   
 
4.1. Participant Demographics  
The variability in findings is in keeping with the premise that pain, injury and illness are complex and 
multifactorial (Schwellnus et al., 2016; Wanivenhaus et al., 2012) , with no single variable predicting 
maladaptation (Soligard et al., 2016) . It is well docum ented that factors including chronological age, training age, 
injury history and physical capacity can impact an athlete ’s training response (Gabbett, 2016) . Chronological age 
and training experience were two factors which varied greatly within this review.  Two studies found significant , 
but contrasting  findings between training load and pain i n this review (Capaci et al., 2002; Krüger et al., 2012) . 
Capaci et al.  (Capaci et al., 2002)  focused on male  competitive swimmers with a young  mean age (14.44 ± 2.4 
years)  and found swimming more hours per week  influenced the presence of pain. This is in contrast to Krüger et 
al. (Krüger et al., 2012) , who solely focused on master’s level swimmers (mean age 49.6 ± 12.29 years) and found 
swimming lower volumes per week to be a risk factor for shoulder pain. This may be explained by the 
considerable changes  experienced with aging, i.e. loss of muscle mass, strength and function, al terations called 
sacropenia (Volpi et al., 2004) . This age related decline also extends to a loss of tendon stiffness, resulting in 
decreased force transfer capabilities (Reeves et al., 2006) . The rotator cuff is among the most common clinical 
tendon problems for the aging populatio n (McCarthy & Hannafin, 2014) , with the risk of having a full thickness 
Training Load and Pain, Injury and Illness in Competitive Swimming  
 22 tear being 2.69 times greater in older adul ts than a dults 10 years their junior (Fehringer et al., 2008) . Older 
athletes face an accumulation of residual injuries which may limit their training volume a nd intensity, thus 
causing a reduct ion in training adaptations (Foster et al., 2007) . This can result in a cyclical pattern of reduced 
ability to train, causing a decreased training load and an increased susceptibility to musculoskeletal injuries. This 
is supported by Tate et al. (Tate et al., 2012)  where the master’s population swam less time per week than any 
other group within the study. The presence of pain at lower volumes may be a by -product of the ‘ injury 
prevention paradox’ , wh ere higher loads are thought  to have a prote ctive effect against injury (Gabbett, 2016) . 
Master ’s athletes, swimming at lower loads, may be more susceptible to injury as they never reach the desired 
threshold of training to provide a protective effect. The reported  modifications in training volume with  age are 
thought to be as a result changes in stroke biomechanics. It has been reported that older swimmers have altered 
stroke biomechanics when compared with elite swimmers. This is understood to be driven b y lower values of 
stroke length  which may be explained by lower mechanical power and muscl e strength (Ferreira et al., 2016) . 
The master’s population, in an effort to reduce the effects of aging and to break the cyclical pattern of load 
related injuries should focus on appropriate recovery strategies between sessions, increased resistance training 
and complementa ry cross -training sessions (Foster et al., 2 007) . 
 
 
The level of a swimmer is also deemed to be a contributing factor to their ri sk of injury. Tate et al.  (Tate et al., 
2012)  explored  the presence of shoulder pain across the lifespan of a swimmer.  They found that as the competitive 
level increased , so did the training exposure in hours per week, up until 15 -19 years old, after which it dropped 
off when entering master ’s level  swimming . This study found that high school swimmers were most symptomatic 
and those swimmers with shoulder pain had significantly more swimming exposure than those without shoulder 
pain (1.5±1.14  years, p = 0.01). However, t his finding was not replicated in acute swimming load (hours/w eek). 
Unfortunately, this study did not include a collegiate swimming group within the study design, leaving a gap 
between those in high -school and master ’s level. Typically, it is thought that the collegiate swimming population 
are at increased risk of injury in the first twelve months of joining a varsity swim team  (Wolf et al., 2009) . This 
was a key finding by Wolf et al.  (Wolf et al., 2009)  who reported the highest number of injuries during the first 
year of eligibility, followed by a substantial drop off in the subsequent years.  In this study, m ale and female 
swimmers had a mean number of injuries of 1.21 and 1.19 in their freshman year compared to 0.71 and 0.46 in 
Training Load and Pain, Injury and Illness in Competitive Swimming  
 23 their senior year (Wolf et al., 2009) . This is likely due to th e transition from high -school or club swimming coupled 
with a sudden increase in training demands, followed by acclimatisation in those that do not drop out of the sport. 
Of the two collegiate swimming populations included in this review, one was not a tru e representation of a high 
level varsity programme due to the low loads presented (Tomar & Allen, 2019) , while the second was a National 
Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA ) Division I population , swimming 18.8  hours/week (Harrington et al., 
2014) . Neither study found a statistically significant relationship between training load and pain or injury ; 
however,  the stage of collegiate swimming was not investigated in either study. Th is could mean that the 
population investigated had become acclimatised to such a training demand  or those who experience pain or injur y 
during the transition from high -school to coll ege do not continue to compete at that level  (Harrington et al., 2014; 
Wolf et al., 2009) .   
 
In an elite population, Hellard  et al.  (Hellard et a l., 2015)  found a  higher risk of pathology in national level 
swimmers compared to  international level swimmers.  Coaches should  consider the level of individual swimmers, 
understandi ng that  swimmers of lower ability may be more susceptible than their counterpar ts. National level 
swimmers may be of a lower training age  or capacity  causing a decreased resistance to illness in comparison to 
their international level counterparts (Hellard et al., 2015) . More mature international level athletes may also 
manage the training lifestyle demands better than their national level peers.  Coaches should ensure that the 
swimmers’ level is considered and modified for when planning training loads and session intensity.  
 
4.2. Operational Outcome Definition  
It has been clearly reported that inconsistencies in methodological approach and definitions  can create significant 
variations in findings (Fuller, 2006) . While a number of consensus statements have provided cl arity in the use of 
standard terminology over recent years, disparities in definitions stem from the specific sporting context for which 
the statements are developed (Roald Bahr et al., 2020) . A total of four (Cejudo et al., 2019; Martins et al., 2018; 
Tessaro et al., 2017; Tomar & Allen, 2019)  of the inclu ded studies were published after the release of the 2016 
FINA consensus statement with none of them making reference to the guidelines and recommendations. A host 
of outcome definitions were used amongst the 15 studies included  in this systematic review, showing large 
inconsistencies that may be a factor in the conflicting nature of the findings. Many of the definitions reported an 
element of TL from the sport, a restriction in training or the need to have sought MA. While the u se of this 
terminology is appropriate and common place in many sports, they have limitations when applied to sports such 
Training Load and Pain, Injury and Illness in Competitive Swimming  
 24 as swimming , where few traditional TL injuries occur (R Bahr, 2009) . As many swimmers  tend to train in the 
presence of pain (Hibberd & Myers, 2013) , using a traditional TL injury definition may mask and under -report 
the true impact of such pain/injuries (R Bahr, 2009) . Successful injury and illness prevention protocols rely on 
the correct categorisation of surveillance data (Palmer -Green et al., 2013) . A c onsensus statement from FINA on 
injury and illness reporting was published in 2016 , and provides a clear framework to be implemented in such 
cases (Mountjoy et al., 2016) . Though this consensus statement provides clarity of the use of set definitions for 
injury, illness, TL and MA classifications, it also highlighted the need to prospectively monitor symptoms and 
complaints through the use of The Oslo Sports Trauma Research Centre (OSTRC) questionnaire . The OSTRC 
questionnaire has been validated in swimming , and can be implemented longitudinally to record medical 
conditions that include complaints not leading to absence from  the sport (Mountjoy et al., 2016) .  
 
While the development of a sport specific consensus statement is a positive step towards consistency in reporting, 
the optimisation of  the dissemination  procedure  and uptake of the key principles is a crucial  aspect of the process . 
Even though r esearchers working within a specific related field may be aware of such consensus statements, those 
working at a practical level may have limited knowledge. The utilisation of consensus statements can be 
determined by the perception of rel evance within a set period of time as developments of these concepts are 
rapidly evolving . As consensus statements can take 12 -18 months to develop, the time elapsed  between evidence  
discuss ion and collation , and recommendations published is crucial (Kwong et al., 2016) . Developing and 
disseminating consensus statements in a timely manner is essential to their effectiveness  and relevance  (Kwong 
et al., 2016) . Consensus statements might benefit from under going a  “knowledge management”  process . 
Knowledge management is the process of simplifying and improving the creation, sharing and distribution of 
knowledge within a system  (Gasik, 2011) . A link between those that develop the consensus statement and the 
relevant National Governing Bod y (NGB) should be formed as part of the dissemination process. Providing clear 
educational strategies to the NGB should be a cornerstone of the dissemination process, allowing the key 
information to be communicate d and understood at the practitioner level.    
 
4.3. Relationship Between Training Load and Pain  
The relationship between training load and  pain was evaluated in twelve of the fifteen studies included in this  
review. A total of two studies  found statistical ly significant  differences or associations between a measure of 
training load and pain  (Capaci et al., 2002; Krüger et al., 2012) . A large percentage (60.5%) of competitive male 
Training Load and Pain, Injury and Illness in Competitive Swimming  
 25 swimmers reported musculoskeletal pain through the use of a questionnaire  (Capaci et al., 2002) . Those who 
experienced pain spent more time training (training history (years)  or training hours per week) , than those without 
pain. This suggest s that those with a longer training history , and who swim more hours per week , have an increased 
chance of experiencing musculoskeletal  pain.  This finding challenges the traditional high-volume  approach which  
spurs the quantity versus quality debate.  Nugent  et al. (F. J. Nugent et al., 2017)  discussed  this concept  with expert 
swimming coaches. Coaches tended to defend the high-volume  swimming approach, particularly in youth 
swimming, as it promotes a large aerobic base and aids in technical development. However, they clarified that 
this should transition to a quality or more intensity based training system as the swimmer improves (F. J. Nugent 
et al., 2017) . This finding is also in contradiction with the theory that training load can have a protective effect 
(Gabbett, 2016) ; however , the ag e of those with pain was relatively young  (14.78±1.56 years). A swimmer ’s 
ability to acclimatise and develop a robustness to higher training thresholds m ay be impacted by maturation  
(Difiori, 2002) , and therefore training hours should be gradually increased and a djusted for the pubertal 
development of the athlete  (Corso, 2018) .  
 
While maturation  was not investigated in the current review and research on the impact of maturation on injury 
is unclear (Bowerman et al., 2014) , coaches should be cognisant of the effects of an adolescent growth spurt on 
their training ability  (Corso, 2018) . A similar  youth  age category  was investigated in four  studies  (Cejudo et al., 
2019; Tate et al., 2012; Tessaro et al., 2017; Walker et al., 2012) . All four stu dies found no statistically significant 
relationship between pain and training load when hours per week, kilometres  per week or frequency of sessions 
per week were examined. Su et al.  (Su et al., 2004)  reported no difference in healthy swimmers compared with 
swimmers with shoulder pain (7.6±5.3 vs . 8.1±5.1 hours/week, p = 0.80) and (3.3±1.1 vs . 3.0±0.9  km/session , p 
= 0.33)  respectively  (Su et al., 2004) . Swim training distance was not a significant predictor  of SIP or significant 
shoulder injury  (SSI)  (SIP: OR 1.0, 95% CI 1.0 – 1.0; p = 0.07 / SSI: OR 1.0, 95% CI 1.0 – 1.0; p =0.11) (Walker 
et al., 2012) . A similar finding reported no  statistically  significant difference between pain and week ly volume  (p 
=0.309) (Tessaro et al., 2017) . Training hours/week showed no difference in those with and without pain across 
a number of age groups (8 -11 years , p =0.18; 12-14 years , p =0.56; 15-19 years , p = 0.71; master ’s, p = 0.06) .  
 
Where hours  per week were monitored, 12-19 year-old swimmers w ere training  approximately 9 -16 hours per 
week  (Tate et al., 2012) . In youth swimming , training capacity  needs to be carefully developed as their technical 
stroke mechanics  improve. Technical aspects  such as  chang ing from unilateral to  bilateral breathing  may be  
Training Load and Pain, Injury and Illness in Competitive Swimming  
 26 improving , resulting in an increased ris k of shoulder pain  as they develop  (Tate et al., 2012) . In populations 
ranging in age from 18 -30 years  old, the training demand typically increased , with five studies reporting average 
training load ranges of 18.8  - 26.8 (±4.8) hours per week , or 45  (±20) - 57.1 (±29.9 ) km/w eek. No difference was 
found in any of the studies for the those with and without pain. These increased training loads suggest that the 
external training load prescribed increases with age , which is in agreement with  Feijen et al. (Feijen et al., 2020) . 
However, the subsequent lack of increase d pain suggests that as the athlete ages , their ability to tolerate  increase d 
external training loads is improved . Another reason may be those athletes th at do not experience pain are more 
likely to remain in the sport for longer periods. By tracking extern al training load (km/session or hr/week)  alone, 
these studies may have been unable to quantify the individual resp onse to external training load , and thus a major 
risk factor for musculoskeletal pain may not have been detected.  
 
Krüger et al.  (Krüger et al., 2012)  was the only study to find a negative association between training load and 
musculoskeletal pain. While th e reported incidence of  pain (62.4%) was similar to that of Capaci et al.  (Capaci et 
al., 2002) , the population and training load measure were different. It was found that the volume of training in 
meters/week was negatively associated with shoulder pain, meaning tho se that swam a lower volume (0 -4,999  
meters/week) were 2.8 times more likely to develop shoulder pain  than those that swam a higher volume (≥12,000 
meters/week) . These findings contrasted with the popular opinion that a swimmers pain is directly proportional 
to training volume (Contreras Fernandez et al., 2012) . While the age of this population could be a significant 
factor in this finding as discussed in section 4.1, there is another possible explanation. This finding could also be 
explained by the injury prevention paradox which highlights that low load can render an athlete less prepared and 
more susceptible to injur y (Gabbett, 2016) . The concept stipulates  that excessive ly high loads may be 
inappropriate for individual athletes and can increase the risk of injury  or illness. However,  loads that are not high 
enough can also create an element of fragility within the athletes’ ability to  tolerate load and have the same 
outcome .  This concept reinforces the idea that training loads are not high or low but are appropriate or 
inappropriate for a specific individual. Coaches need to consider all the individual elements when planning 
appropriate loads to ensure a reduced risk of pai n, injury or illness  (Halson, 2014) .  
 
4.4. Relationship Between Training Load and Injury  
The relationship between training load and injury was assessed in two of the included studies. The studies reported 
contrasting findings with one (Ristolainen et al., 2014)  presenting the finding that injured swimmers had swum 
Training Load and Pain, Injury and Illness in Competitive Swimming  
 27 significantly more than non -injured swimmers in the past 12 months ( p = 0.04).  The second study (Tomar & 
Allen, 2019)  stated that no ass ociation between measures of tot al training load (sRPE ), training monotony, strain 
or ACWR and incidence of injury was present. The populations and method s studied  in both papers varied great ly. 
While Tomar  and Allen (Tomar & Allen, 2019)  used a  common  method of monitoring training load  (sRPE)  
(Williams, Trewartha, et al., 2017) , their population was not exposed to a rigorous training regime over a duration 
that is reflective of competitive swimming environments. Conversely, the population in Ristolainen et al.  
(Ristolainen et al., 2014)  was an elite group of swimmers. However, the retrospective study design, coupled with 
a twelve -month recall period, the measurement of external training loa d and no quantification o f internal training 
load means less confidence may be placed on the results.  
 
4.5. Relationship Between Training Load and Illness  
The relationship between training load and i llness  was investigated in one study meeting the required inclusion 
and exclusion crit eria. The study utilised a prospective cohort design where training loads and illness was logged 
over a four -year period  (Hellard et al., 2015) . The population observed were elite level swimmers , with both 
internal and external training loads being monitored. Training load was quantified in meters per week at each 
intensity determined by a blood lactate step test detailed by  Mujika  et al.  (Mujika et al., 1996) . Findings showed 
a positive relationship between training loads and illness with periods of high training loads (OR 1.10, 95% CI 
1.01 – 1.19; p = 0.0244) increasing the odds of illness by 50 -70%. While this single study presents limited 
evidence, it does concur with the review  of Drew and  Finch (Drew & Finch, 2016)  who summate d that the 
relationship between training load and illness was found to be moderate. The review found a positive relationship 
in sports such as speed skating, Australian football, soccer and rugby league, with no relationship in an elite 
running population  (Drew & Finch, 2016) .  
 
4.6. Monitoring Training Load  
The studies included in this systematic review, relied heavily on the use of self -reported d ata collected  
retrospectively  through the use of ques tionnaires. This data is  dependent  on the athlete’s ability to recall and report 
their individual training data accurately (Black et al., 2016) . Previous research has shown that quantifying exercise 
dosage  from data collected by questionnaire  may be considered as inadequate (Borresen & Lambert, 2006) , 
particularly with retrospective questionnaires, as the longer the recall period the less accurate the reported 
estimates (Kjellsson et al., 2014) . The majority of the retrospective studies used a  twelve -month rec all period  
Training Load and Pain, Injury and Illness in Competitive Swimming  
 28 (Ristolainen et al., 2014; Tessaro et al., 2017; Walker et al., 2012) , with one spanning a three -year period (Krüger 
et al., 2012) . Previous research has shown a twelve -month recall to be sufficient  method of collecting data  
(Mukherjee, 2015) . However, in a study compari ng retrospective and prospective injury surveillance data , perfect 
agreement between the two methods was found when a simple yes or no answer was required. However,  the 
accuracy of recall was severely  diminished  (approx. 40%) when specific  details were  required (Gabbe, 2003) . 
This shows that the use of self -reported retrospective data for establishing patterns in sport should be avoided 
when detailed information is needed.   
 
The relationship between training load and pain was evaluated using external training load in all twelve relevant 
studies . Of the two studies examining the relationship between training load and injury , one utilised a measure of 
external training load, with the second study reporting both internal and external training load. Finally, the 
relationship between training load and illness was assessed using both internal and  external training load . The 
results showed that session duration (hours/week) was the  most widely used external training load measure with 
swimming durations of 4.0 (± 1.7) - 24 hours /week , and was closely followed by distance per session (km) . An 
external trai ning load such as hours/week,  should be carefully im plemented particularly in an advanced  training  
environment . Beginner and intermediate athletes can focus on increas es in training time  to good effect ; however , 
once a training  programme has plateaued, any further  increase in tra ining hours can become  unproductive  
resulting in session intensity being manipulated in order to achieve a training effect  (Friel, 2018) . Monitoring 
training distance (km/week) can also cause issues as the swim load measure cannot be extrapolated to other cross -
training modalities such as resistance training.  This leads to multiple measures of load being collected but unable 
to be combined or aspects of the training programme not being monitored at all. Another limitation of the 
exclusive use of external tr aining load met hods is that it  does not accurately capture the athletes’  individual 
response to the training dose and therefore internal training load needs to be  combined with external load to 
provide greater insight to training stress (Bourdon et al., 20 17). The use of sRPE  has become one of the most 
commonly used measures of intensity in team spor ts. Session RPE, combined with session duration can provide 
an integrated training load measure capturing an athlete’s  external load and their individual response to it. An 
additional  benefit of this approach is the ability to monitor sRPE globally across a training programme such as 
resistance training and cross train ing, allowing for a holistic monitoring approach to al l aspects of the programme 
(Williams, Trewartha, et al., 2017) .   
 
Training Load and Pain, Injury and Illness in Competitive Swimming  
 29 All but two (Hellard et al., 2015; Tomar & Allen, 2019)  of the included  studies used external training load 
exclusively as a means of quantifying training load. Bourdon et al . (Bourdon et al., 2017)  summated that an 
integrated approach to training load monitoring is important  as no single marker of an athletes response to load 
can consistently predict maladaptation (Soligard et al., 2016) .  Therefore int ernal and external load  should be 
monitored in combination to provide greater insight (Bourdon et al., 2017) . Tomar and Allen (Tomar & Allen, 
2019)  and Hellard et al.  (Hellard et al., 2015)  both used a combination of int ernal and external training load in 
line with current recommendatio ns. Rating of Perceived Exertion was collected as a measure of internal training 
load and was monitored in conjunction with session du ration by Tomar  and Allen (Tomar & Allen, 2019) . The 
data was anal ysed to provide measures of training load, monotony  and strain (Foster, 1998; Foster et al., 2001)  as 
well as ACWR , as outlined  by Gabbett  et al.  (Gabbett, 2016) . These training parameters were employed to find 
the relationship with inc idence of injury in a university swimming population over a seven -week period. No 
significant relationship was found between training load, strain and monotony or ACWR and the inciden ce of 
injury in this population, which contradicts earlier studies in a variety of sports (Anderson et al., 2003; Gabbett & 
Jenkins, 2011; Hulin et al., 2014) . The lack of significan t association  could be due to the observational period 
being  relatively short ( seven  weeks) or the low training load experienced by the group. A weekly mean training 
load of 260±56.33  Arbit rary Units ( AU) appears to be relatively low, compared to other competitive sporting 
populations . The mean weekly ACWR was  0.94±.53 with a peak of 1.03. These ACWR are within acceptable risk 
ranges according to Gabbett  et al.  (Gabbett, 2016)  and combined with the low training load are unlikely to stress 
the athlete s beyond their capacity  (Gabbett, 2016) .   
 
Tomar  and Allen (Tomar & Allen, 2019)  was the only study in the r eview to use the Foster et al. (Foster, 1998; 
Foster et al., 2001)  method of monitoring training load. This is in contrast to Eckard et al. (Eckard et al., 2018)  
whose multisport review of fifty -seven studies found twenty -two ( 39%)  of those studies m easured internal training 
load using the sRPE method. A similar multisport review conducted by Drew and Finch (Drew & Finch, 2016)  
found tha t twenty -five out of a total of thirty -five (71%) studies utilised sRPE.  The significant difference between 
the frequency of sRPE use in swim specific research and a multisport research highlights how underutilised this 
method of monitoring training load is in competitive swimming research.  
 
Research surrounding training load has evolved to understand that neither high or low tr aining load can be 
considered  solely at fault for  pain,  injury  or illness (Gabbett, 2016) . It is more central to consider t he appropriate 
Training Load and Pain, Injury and Illness in Competitive Swimming  
 30 amount  of training load or rate of load application for that individual athlete  in order  to maximise performance  
while simultaneously limiting maladaptation (Gabbett, 2019; Griffin et al., 2020) . Researc h into m onitoring  
changes in training load originated with Banisters “Training Stress Balance” method and developed into the 
ACWR in recent years (Griffin et al., 2020) . The ACWR  is designed to balance the most recent training loads 
(acute) with the athletes’ recent history of training load (chronic) in  an effort to predict how fit or fatigued they 
are (Hulin et al., 2014) . The ACWR has been shown to quantify changes in training load by presenting a numerical 
range where train ing load is said to be at the “sweet spot” and injury risk is reduced (0.8 – 1.3) (Gabbett, 2 016). 
It is important to note that this sweet spot numerical range can vary per population  and individual physical 
capacities  with team sports citing a ACWR sweet spot of 1.00 -1.25 (Malone et al., 2017)  and 0.85 -1.35 (Hulin et 
al., 2014) . This is crucial to an individual athlete sport like swimming where  a squad “sweet spot” range cannot 
be relied upon and  each individual’s ACWR need s to be quantified . While a number of studies have used this 
method to goo d effect in a variety of sports  (Bowen et al., 2019; Carey et al., 2017; Delecroix et al., 2018; Hulin 
et al., 2014) , the most accurate method of calculating the ACWR is contentious (Menaspà, 2017; Williams, West, 
et al., 2017) . A recent review by Griffin et al.  (Griffin et al., 2020)  investigated the association between ACWR 
and injury in team sports. The review concluded that ACWR is associated with non -contact injuries which is a 
key findi ng for  sport s like swimming. The review also highlighted the key differences between the calculation of 
ACWR using the rolling average model and the exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) model. The 
rolling average m odel divides the acute workload by the chronic workload whereas the  EWMA model accounts 
for the decaying nature of fitness and fatigue by applying a greater weight to the most recent loads (Griffin et al., 
2020) .  While the rolling average model has received more substan tial attention in team sport research , the review 
states  that EWMA may be a more sensitive measure  (Griffin et al., 2020) .  The applicability of these models 
warrants further investigation, particularly in an elite swimming population where current research is severely 
limited.  
 
Hellard et al.  (Hellard et al., 2015)  quantified intensity levels based on the work of  Mujika et al.  (Mujika et al., 
1996)  where blood lactate concentration was mapped throughout a swim specific step test  (Mujika et al., 1996) . 
Session intensities were planned accordingly  and in conjunction with meters per week. Low intensity training 
load was categorised as the  mean percentage volume at intensity levels 1 -3, while high intensity training was 
categorised at  intensity levels 4 and 5. Results of the study showed the odds of illness were 50% -70% higher 
during intensive training periods. The risk of illness was also increased during winter months , and in national 
Training Load and Pain, Injury and Illness in Competitive Swimming  
 31 level swimmers over international level swimmers. Coaches should be aware of the increased risks of URTPI 
during intensive training periods  and should accurately measure and programme the intensity and overall load of 
the sessions accordingly. The scheduling of intensive training periods should be strategic, keeping non -sport stress 
in mind and avoiding periods of high academic or professional re sponsibilities , or demanding competition 
calendars. This is particularly important du ring the winter months where the  population risk of URTPI is already 
considerably high  (Hellard et al., 2015) . The findings also showed that for every 10% increase in training  load, a 
corresponding 10% increase in the risk of illness was likely , which is in agreement with current evidence th at has 
shown very high training loads, very low loads and rapid changes in load can also contribute to illness (Schwellnus 
et al., 2016) . The findings indicate that recover y strategies during intensive training blocks should be given higher 
consideration than normal. This is particularly important directly after acute maximal speed sessions (blood lactate 
≥10 mmo·L-1) as these sessions contributed most to increasing risk of illness. This finding is in line with general 
consensus that immune disturbances are associated with acute session intensity (Walsh et al., 2011) . A consensus 
statement by Walsh et al. (Walsh et al., 2011)  highlighted that , in order to maintain immune health , training 
programmes should involve gradual increases in volume and intensity, avoiding sudden increases, adding variety 
of stimuli including cross -training metho ds and paying particular attention to recovery and nutritional strategies  
(Walsh et al., 2011) . 
 
Training Load and Pain, Injury and Illness in Competitive Swimming  
 32 5. FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS  
The ability to synthesi se the data and summ arise  the findings is s ignificantly restricted by study design, a variet y 
of training load methods , large variations in pop ulation  and operating definitions of pain, injury , and illness.  The 
guidance of a consensus statement may have aided authors in collecting both internal and external training load, 
which in  turn would have improved the strength of the results . However, as only four (Cejudo et al., 2019; Martins 
et al., 2018; Tessaro et al., 2017; Tomar & All en, 2019)  of the studies included in this systematic review were 
published after the introduction of the most recent FINA (Mountjoy et al., 2016)  and IOC (Schwellnus et al., 
2016; Soligard et al., 2016)  Consensus Guidelines covering load  and the risk of injury and illness, their overall 
influence was diminished. Publication prior to 2016 reduced the likelihood of authors maintaining a high level of 
consensus in the operational definitions used for pain, injury and illness, as well as the protocols used to collect 
that information. Nevertheles s, only one (Tomar & Allen, 2019)  of the  four studies highlighted made reference to 
the IOC consensus statement, with none referenc ing the FINA consensus statement . This systematic review 
highlights the need to refer to these guidelines  prior to publishing research of this nature, ideally improv ing the 
study design and consistency across training load and injury/illness surveillance methods.  
 
Conducting a meta -analysis was not possible within this review due to the large discrepancies between the studies’  
definitions, analys es, data collection methods and load measures . Future research should stri ve to rectify the  
limit ations presented by this review by conforming to published consensus statements. If adherence to these 
guidelines was to increase going forward, the publication of a meta -analysis  would be of signific ant benefit to 
researchers and practitioners alike .  
 
The FINA guidelines also recommend in and out -of-competition monito ring of  athletes using a sport -specific tool 
such as OSTRC (Mountjoy et al., 2016) . This validated questionnaire has played an increasing role in sports injury 
and illness surveillance as it is purposefully designed for the collection of conditions that are below the time -loss 
threshold (Roald Bahr et al., 2020) .  
 
Load monitoring is largely a subjective practice and thus is reliant on an athlete ’s recall of the key variables. 
While subjective measures have been shown to be more sensitive a nd consistent than objective measures in 
determining homeostatic changes to load (Schwellnus et al., 2016) , their use in retrospective studies can lead to 
inaccuracies in d ata collection. Future research should focus on prospective cohort study designs as they are 
Training Load and Pain, Injury and Illness in Competitive Swimming  
 33 considered to be more reliable and generate real -time knowledge and allow for a more accurate estimation of the 
risk and incidence of injury and illness (Mukherjee, 2015) .  
 
While a variety of training load measures can be used in the m onitoring of athletes, it is clear that no one measure 
will provide a clear picture when used in isolation. The reliance upon training volume as an external training load 
measure in a variety of forms was unable to determine a standardised variable suitabl e for a swimming population. 
To that end, in line with recent consensus statements, a combination of  internal and external training load should 
be used in an integrated approach (Bourdon et al., 2017) .  
 
Future research also needs to explore the applicability of the sRPE method of monitoring internal training load 
within competitive swimming. A recent review by Eckard et al.  (Eckard et al., 2018)  found that  22/57 articles 
used the sRPE metho d to quantify session intensity. S tatistically significant results  were reported in 21 studies , 
with one study reporting all null findings  (Eckard et al., 2018) . The collection of sRPE in conjunction with 
additional external training load provides the opportunity to investigate the  effect of not only increased loads , but 
also ch anges in load. Unlike similar research in other sports , no study has investigated the links between training 
load and the incidence of pain, injury and illness  in an elite swimming population  using sRPE  in a longitudinal 
prospective cohort study.  
 
Finally, research into elite competitive swimming populations is necessary to provide a clear picture of the 
associations between training load and pain, injury and illness for coaches and practitioners working at the highest 
echelons of the sport. Conducting research at elite level is often difficult due to the limited access, numbers of 
athletes and ability to implement good research processes in the practical training environments. However, t here 
is greater control and resources available at that level , with less confounding factors affecting the results. A 
universal classification model as seen in Swann et al. (Swann et al., 2015)  should be referred to when defining 
the athletes level of expertise, allowing for improved  clarity and  comparison of populations (Roald Bahr et al., 
2020) . 
Training Load and Pain, Injury and Illness in Competitive Swimming  
 34 6. CONCLUSIONS  
This systematic review provides an appraisal of the literature examining the r elationship between training load 
and pain, injury, and illness in competitive swimming. The findings highlight that the relationship between these 
variables is unclear owing to a host of methodological constraints associated with research in this field.  While the 
relationship has yet to be established, the review highlights that youth, master’s and competitive swimmers of a 
lower ability should receive particular attention. Planning of load within the seasonal calendar needs prudence, 
with winter months be ing a key period in the training cycle. Sessions of higher intensity and speed elements 
should be planned with caution. Monitoring and injury surveillance practices need to be developed in conjunction 
with consensus guidelines, ensuring load monitoring inc ludes both internal and external training loads. The use 
of longitudinal load monitoring of elite populations, utilising sRPE and investigating the applicability of the 
ACWR and EWMA approaches should be a priority for researchers going forward. This will not only improve 
the quality of the research being conducted, it will also provide greater clarity on the relationship between training 
load and pain, injury, and illness.
