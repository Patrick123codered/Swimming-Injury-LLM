43 Journal of Emergencies, Trauma, and Shock I 8:1 I Jan - Mar 2015 respectively in patients with shoulder dislocations. Inferior 
shoulder dislocation (luxatio erecta humeri) is a relatively rare 
form of  glenohumeral dislocation, accounting for only 0.5% of  
all shoulder dislocations.[4]
Case reports published irregularly in emergency medicine and 
orthopedic literature. The mechanism of  this injury involves 
either direct axial loading on a fully abducted extremity or leverage 
of  the humeral head across the acromion by a hyperabduction 
force.[2,5,6]
The direct mechanism is more common and results from 
axial loading of  a fully abducted upper extremity. This leads 
to impaction of  the humerus into the inferior capsule, often 
accompanied by a rotator cuff  tear and fracture of  the greater 
tuberosity. The indirect mechanism is a hyperabduction force on 
a fully abducted upper extremity causing the proximal humerus 
to be forced over the acromion. This may also cause rotator cuff, 
inferior glenohumeral capsule or glenohumeral ligament tears.[2]
Closed reduction (traction-countertraction method) treatment 
regime should be chosen first. Neurovascular injuries may be 
associated with luxatio erecta humeri.Concomitant fracture of  
the acromion, clavicle, coracoid, greater tuberosity, and humeral 
neck and head may also be seen.[5,7]INTRODUCTION
Middledorpf  and his assistant Scharm, in 1859 are generally 
credited with first recognizing the unique nature of  luxatio 
erecta humeri.[1,2]
The clinical presentation of  this type of  shoulder dislocation 
is unique, with the arm fully abducted, elbow flexed and the 
forearm is resting on or behind the patient’s head.[3] Anterior 
and posterior dislocations are observed in the ratio of  95%:4.5% Luxatio erecta humeri: Report of a swimming

ABSTRACT
Inferior shoulder dislocation also referred to as luxatio erecta is an unusual and rare type of shoulder dislocation. Its incidence 
is about 0.5% among all shoulder dislocations. After an exhaustive search of all the available literature we were unable to 
find a swimming accident case that did not have other associated injuries and an uneventful reduction. The mechanism of 
the injury was mostly related to direct axial loading and indirect hyperabduction lever arm. We would like to emphasize the 
importance of this being a swimming accident, a type of accident that requires awareness of the possibility of dangerous 
asphyxia injuries caused by panic in the water (swimming pool, river, lake, sea, etc.). We described the nature of the injury 
and review the literature concerning the mechanism of the injury and associated neurovascular impairment at admission 
time. We also presented a supplemental video to contribute to the education of young residents and orthopedic surgeons.

Gökkus ¸, et al.: Luxatio erecta humeri: Report of a swimming injury 44 Journal of Emergencies, Trauma, and Shock I 8:1 I Jan - Mar 2015In this article, we want to present a classic case of  luxatio erecta 
humeri with a didactic video supplement (See the video), describe 
the nature of  the injury (see the Figure 2) and review the literature 
concerning the mechanism of  injury and associated neuravscular 
impairment at admission time.
CASE REPORT
A 38-year-old right handed male was admitted to the Emergency 
Department with an erected right arm over his head (29 July 
2013-Memorial Hospital Antalya/Turkey) The injured person 
was a tourist in our country who did not speak Turkish or any 
of  the major languages covered by our hospital translation staff. 
Consequently we had difficulty communicating with him and 
could not establish how the injury occurred. The only definite 
information we had was that he was dressed in a swimming 
costume and the paramedics informed us that they had removed 
him from a swimming pool.
Physical examination revealed the patient to be a well-
developed male who was in severe pain. He was awake and 
oriented. His right upper extremity was abducted at the 
right shoulder, flexed at the elbow, with his right forearm 
pronated, a position characteristic of  an inferior shoulder 
dislocation (luxatio erecta). His humeral head was palpated 
inferior to the glenoid fossa and was in the axillary fold, 
no neurovascular impairment detected. Any attempt at 
movement of  the right shoulder elicited extreme pain 
and apprehension on the part of  the patient. Radiographs 
revealed an inferior glenohumeral dislocation [Figure 1a 
and b].
INVESTIGATIONS
On inspection the right erected arm was observed to be over 
the head and the right shoulder was locked in a fixed position 
causing intense pain.
Computed tomography revealed inferior glenohumeral 
dislocation without any associated fracture [Figure 1c].
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
This clinical entity is unique for that reason so there is not another 
disease in the differential diagnosis check list.
TREATMENT
A closed reduction under a sedoanelgesia treatment regime was 
chosen initially (if  unsuccessful this treatment should not be 
attempted more than once). The closed reduction was carried 
out with a traction-counter traction technique [Figure 1d-See the 
Video 1 ] and the reduction was confirmed by X-ray [Figure 1e]. 
One hour after reduction the shoulder was immobilized within a 40° abduction by utilizing a cushioned sling for 3 weeks. 
Three week after reduction, a coddman exercise program was 
initiated twice a day and a standard arm sling for daytime use 
was recommended. By the 6th week the patient claimed to be 
asymptomatic.
OUTCOME AND FOLLOW UP
The patient was allowed to do active exercise. He regained his 
shoulder functions within 3 months.
DISCUSSION
There have been few previously published case reports 
and clinical series focusing on the mechanism of  the injury 
concerning luxatio erecta.
A systematic search of  the PubMed database was performed. 
The following research criteria were applied: 
1.  Papers written in English or which we could obtain english 
written abstract, 
2. Papers examining luxatio erecta, 
3. Cases involving a mechanism of  injury. 
Of  86 articles only 57 fullfilled the inclusion criteria. Other 
papers involved non English languages, papers which we could 
not obtain full text articles or abstracts (18 articles) and other 
issues [luxatio erecta hip-12 articles].
In this study, we reviewed the mechanism of  injuries of 
all cases (57 articles) and classified the injuries into seven 
parts: Falling accidents (25 articles),[3,8-10,12,16-34,54] accidents 
related to working (5 articles),[12,14,35-38] sport related injuries 
(9 articles),[2,19,36,39-45] traffic accidents (10 articles),[4,13,15,45-50,57] 
alcholism, epilepsy, syncope, seizure and sleeping related 
injuries (6 articles),[5,8, 18, 40,51-52] unusual age (infant) with 
unusual mechanism (1 article),[53] boat accident (1 article)[54] 
[Table 1].
We found 20 articles that reported neurovascular injury at 
admission time (16 articles reported neuorologic injury-4 
articles reported vascular injury)[4,7-11,12,14,34,37,40,42,45,46,47,48,51,54,56,57] 
[Table 2].
We could not obtain full text of  one additional article to the 57 
stated above, which reported neurovascular injury in vascular 
surgery concerned journal.
The common point of  many falling accidents and the boat 
accident was seen to be indirect injury (Trying to stop the 
falling action by grabbing something, causing arm leverage to 
the shoulder through acromion and resulting in luxation erecta). 
In our case, we believed that the overhead position of  the arm 
facilitated this type of  the injury. We would like to show the 
mechanism of  the injury in Figure 2. We would again stress

Gökkus ¸, et al.: Luxatio erecta humeri: Report of a swimming injury 45 Journal of Emergencies, Trauma, and Shock I 8:1 I Jan - Mar 2015 the awareness required of  possible asphyxia when treating the 
results of  swimming related accidents.
The youngest patient of  the publications reviewed was an infant 
who had an Erb-Duchene palsy and was accidentally injured by his mother while he was being manipulated-1971.[53] The oldest 
patient was 94-year-old woman who lost her balance while using 
a walker and fell onto her right side.[55]
According to criteria of  mechanism of  injury in that it was a 
swimming related injury, our case publishes unique information. 
Luxatio erecta humeri has a distinctive clinical appearance, 
failure to aware of  this could lead an incorrect diagnosis and 
inappropriate reduction maneuvers, which would be painful 
for the patient and could possibly lead to neurovascular injury. 
Attention should be paid to possible neurovascular injury during Table 1 : See the article list which were arrenged according to mechanism of the injury

Gökkus ¸, et al.: Luxatio erecta humeri: Report of a swimming injury 47 Journal of Emergencies, Trauma, and Shock I 8:1 I Jan - Mar 2015 the initial trauma. Close follow up must be performed after the 
reduction in order to monitor the neurovascular status of  the 
upper extremity.
If  reduction cannot be achieved at the first attempt, the possibility 
of  the humeral head trapping in soft tissue or buttonholed 
through the glenohumeral ligament or inferior capsule must be 
considered. In this case open reduction is mandatory. Inferior 
glenohumeral dislocations are thought to cause greater soft-tissue 
injury involving the labrum, capsule, rotator cuff. The humeral 
head may buttonhole through the inferior capsule, making these 
injuries difficult to close and reduce.[2]
On rare occasions, the humeral head may rupture the inferior 
capsule preventing closed reduction and the injury may be severe 
enough to create an open inferior glenohumeral dislocation.[14]
In a recent case report, arthroscopy after the reduction of 
inferior glenohumeral dislocation demonstrated detachment of  
the superior labral anterior posterior complex, which extended 
to the anteroinferior portion of  the glenoid labrum.[15] The 
authors performed open reduction of  the greater tuberosity 
fragment, followed by arthroscopic labral repair with three 
suture anchors.[15]
If  the patient’s expectancy is an active life and rotator cuff  tear 
is documented after the reduction, surgical repair at a later date 
must be considered. An associated greater tuberosity fracture 
can often be seen. Other rarely associated fractures noted were: 
Humeral fracture (Groh et al.[45]), gleonoid fracture (Imerci 
et al.,[4] Fung et al.,[22] Patel et al.[47]), nondisplaced scapular spine 
fracture (Begaz et al.[49] 2006), humeral head fracture, acromion 
fracture and A-C joint dislocation (Mallon et al.[40]), both bone 
forearm fracture (Frank et al.[37]), surgical neck fracture of 
humerus (Tomcovcik et al.[13]), clavicle fracture, lateral humeral 
epicondyle fracture, scapula fracture, bony bankart lesion 
(Patel et al.[47]).
Two open dislocations were reported (Garrigues et al.[14] and 
Davison et al.[35]). In our case there was no associated injury.
CONCLUSION
Inferior shoulder dislocation (luxatio erecta humeri) is relatively 
rare form of  glenohumeral dislocation accounting for only 0.5% 
of  all shoulder dislocations.
Luxatio erecta humeri have a distinctive clinical appearance; 
failure to be aware of  this appearence could lead an incorrect 
diagnosis and inappropriate reduction maneuvers, which would 
be painful and could possibly, lead to neurovascular injury.
The mechanism of  this injury can involve either direct axial 
loading on a fully abducted extremity or leverage of  the humeral 
head across the acromion by a hyperabduction force.Closed reduction under sedoanelgesia treatment method   should 
be chosen first.
Attention should be paid to the possibility of  neurovascular 
injury during initial trauma, reduction, and close follow up must 
be performed after the reduction.
Attention must be paid to neurovascular status of  the upper 
extremity.
If  the first attempt at reduction could not be achieved, the 
possibility of  humeral head trapping in soft tissue or buttonholed 
through the glenohumeral ligament or capsule must be 
considered.
If  the patient’s expectancy is an active life and a rotator cuff  tear 
is documented after the reduction, a surgical repair at a later date 
must be considered.
