Abstract
Background: Diving is the most frequent cause of spinal cord injury (SCI) from recreation and sport in Canada. This study was done to identify
risk factors for SCI from diving in the province of Quebec.
Methods: An interview survey was done for a target population of 203 subjects with a SCI from diving treated in the two specialized rehabilitation
centers in Quebec during 1961–2004. Telephone interviews of consenting individuals were used to collect pertinent personal, equipment, and
environmental factors for each incident.
Results: Response was 44% (89/203); 92% were male and 85% <35 years old. Only 37% were aware prior to injury of the risk of SCI from diving,
and only 33% had received water safety training. Swimming pools were the site of 51% ( n= 45) and natural bodies of water for 49% ( n= 44). 87%
(n= 39) of pools were single-unit home pools and 57% ( n= 26) above-ground. Depth indicators were absent for 100% of above-ground and 74% of
in-ground pools. For SCI in in-ground pools, 63% resulted from striking the up-slope between deep and shallow ends. For dives at natural sites, a
dock or wharf was the most frequent location, 36% ( n= 16). In 52% of pools and 79% of natural sites, depth was <1.4 m (4.6 ft). Signs prohibiting
diving were absent in 96% of above-ground and 89% of in-ground pools. Alcohol was reported in 47% of SCIs.
Interpretation: The target for prevention of diving SCI is male youths and young adults. Above-ground pools are too shallow and small for diving.
Deep ends of many in-ground pools are excessively shallow and short since many SCIs resulted from striking the up-slope. Prevention of SCI from
diving needs to focus on education of potential victims, pool vendors and manufacturers, and regulations for safety norms in private pools. Water
safety should highlight diving as a high-risk activity, and emphasize that most home pools and natural sites are unsafe. Safer evidence-based pool
designs and more effective warnings need to be implemented.

1. Introduction
Spinal cord injury (SCI) has devastating personal and eco-

globally, an annual rate of 22 per million population ( ICCP,
2001 ). While global data are not available on the incidence
of sports-related SCI, in the United States and Europe sport
accounts for 9–10% of all SCI ( Parliamentary Assembly, 2002;
NSCISC, 2005 ). In many industrialized countries, including
the United States, diving is the source of the majority of
sports-related SCI and is therefore a priority for sports injury
prevention.

The relative importance of diving as a cause of SCI varies
enormously by country, ranging from 1 to 23%, with lows
in Japan, Turkey, and South Africa, mid-range in Australia,
Canada, and the United States, and highs in Poland and Russia
(ICCP, 2001; Parliamentary Assembly, 2002; NSCISC, 2005,
2006; Blanksby et al., 1997; Karacan et al., 2000; Kiwerski,
1993; Djerrari, 2000; O’Connor, 2002; RCIS, 2006; Grifﬁths,
1980; Aito et al., 2005; DeVivo, 2003 ). While diving is much
less frequent as a source of SCI than trafﬁc injuries, falls, and
violence in the United States, it was still the fourth leading cause
at 7%, with about 770 diving SCIs per year, and the leading
source for recreation and sport ( NSCISC, 2005, 2006 ). All sports
injuries combined accounted for 9% of SCI, with nearly 80%
of this contributed by diving; however, the relative importance
of diving shows large racial differences in the United States
(DeVivo, 2003 ). Elsewhere, in the Spinal Unit in Florence, Italy,
diving injuries similarly comprised 62% of SCI from sports, and
6% of all SCI ( Aito et al., 2005 ).
Diving ranked higher as a cause of SCI in Canada, and in
Australia, than in the United States, where gunshots/violence
were third at 14% ( Djerrari, 2000; O’Connor, 2002; RCIS,
2006; Grifﬁths, 1980; NSCISC, 2005, 2006 ). In the province
of Quebec, Canada, diving ranked third as a cause of SCI during
1981–1994, accounting for 6% of SCI overall ( Djerrari, 2000 ).
While population-based incidence rates provide a better indi-
cator of frequency and burden of SCI from diving and other
causes than do proportions and ranks, rates are rarely reported.
Even better would be exposure per swimmer, diver, dives, and
so forth, together with national information about prevalence
of pools with different attributes, but such data are currently
unavailable.
Incidence and proportions for Quebec province, Canada, and
a few other countries are shown in Table 1 . In both Quebec and
Canada, incidence rates were about 10 times higher for males
than females, and the main risk groups by age were 15–44 years
(Djerrari, 2000 ). Although the average incidence in Quebec was
slightly less than for the rest of the country during 1981–1994,
greater improvement was evident in other provinces. During1991–2000 in Canada, there were 31 head and/or spinal injury
deaths from diving reported by coroners, an average of about 3
per year, or 1 per 10 million population ( Barss, 2006 ).
It is reported that in all dives, velocity at maximum depth
exceeds that required to dislocate cervical vertebrae, and in
99% is sufﬁcient to crush them ( Blitvich et al., 2003a,b; Stone,
2003 ). In some cases of SCI there is neither dislocation nor
fracture, and only spinal cord contusion is found. Clearly, any
dive can potentially result in a lifetime of severe disability, or
death.
On average, diving SCI are more disabling than SCI from
trafﬁc or falls as nearly all are cervical and result in tetraple-
gia rather than paraplegia ( DeVivo and Sekar, 1997; NSCISC,
2005 ). Hence in countries where diving injuries are an important
issue, this cause assumes greater prominence as a source of cer-
vical SCI. To illustrate, in Australia, diving accounted for about
10% of admissions to spinal units, but for 20% of tetraplegias
(O’Connor, 2002; RCIS, 2006; Grifﬁths, 1980 ). However, in the
United States, 88% of SCIs from sports, mainly diving, resulted
in tetraplegia, compared with road injuries 55%, falls 53%,
and violence 29% ( NSCISC, 2005 ). Even among tetraplegias,
severity was greater for sports, with 46% complete tetraplegias
and 54% incomplete, compared with motor vehicles 40% com-
plete, and falls 29% complete; only tetraplegias from violence
were more severe, 52% complete ( NSCISC, 2005 ). Urbaniza-
tion also affects relative importance of diving as a source of
cervical SCI; in Poland, diving accounted for 31% of cervical
SCIs of urban residents and 11% for rural, whereas among rural
residents, falls from farm horse carts made up 42% ( Kiwerski,
1993 ).
External causes of SCI vary by age. Road injuries and sport,
and in the United States, violence, are frequent among children
and young adults and falls are among older adults ( NSCISC,
2005 ). Hence, the combination of young age of most diving SCI
victims plus severity of SCI means that economic costs of care
are much greater than for most other causes, not to mention the
large loss of disability-free life years ( NSCISC, 2005; DeVivo,
1997 ).

To better address SCIs from diving in Quebec and to improve
prevention programs, we investigated personal, equipment, and
environmental risk factors among patients with a diving SCI who
had been treated in either of the two major Quebec rehabilitation
hospitals.
2. Methods
2.1. Study design and time period
Because diving SCIs are uncommon catastrophic injuries,
we undertook a retrospective survey for the 44-year period
(1961–2004) for which ﬁles were available, interviewing vic-
tims contacted via the two main rehabilitation hospitals. The
study began in 1996 and was completed with an update during
2004–2005.
2.2. Target population
This included all known survivors of SCI from diving into
shallow water. After the acute period, most patients are treated in
either the Institut de r ´eadaptation de Montr ´eal (IRM) or the Insti-
tut de r ´eadaptation en d ´eﬁcience physique de Qu ´ebec (IRDPQ).
Quebec is the second most populous province in Canada with a
population of 7.5 million; at study midpoint it was 6.5 million.
2.3. Data sources
Diving SCIs were identiﬁed with MedEcho, the provin-
cial hospital database, using International Classiﬁcation
of Diseases, Ninth Revision ( World Health Organization,
1978 ). This database includes all injured persons hospi-
talized for >24 h and employs well-trained professional
coders. Personal, equipment and environmental risk factors
were obtained by telephone interview. Since patients were
contacted only by telephone, impairment was not evalu-
ated with the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA)
scale, nor was point of impact or exact level of injury
assessed.
2.4. Inclusion criteria
This study included persons with cervical SCI from diving
sustained in Quebec with hospital stays of >24 h treated at IRM
or IRDPQ; hence, deaths prior to transfer or minor injuries were
excluded. SCIs due to diving are identiﬁed by external cause
code E883.0, together with nature of injury codes 806.0–806.1
(cervical spine fracture with SCI), and 952.0 (cervical SCI with-
out spinal bone injury), or code 344 tetraplegia ( World Health
Organization, 1978 ). While E883 includes injuries from both
diving and jumping, it is unlikely that jumping causes cervical
spine injury, and, in any case, diving was conﬁrmed during inter-
views. Other diving injuries and deaths prior to hospitalization
were not assessed.2.5. Sampling and ethical approval
Following approval by hospital ethics committees, all diving
SCI admissions during 1961–2004 were selected. Conﬁdential-
ity guidelines do not allow contact between researchers and
patients until the hospital obtains informed consent. The medical
records department sent out our explanatory letters to eligible
patients; those who consented were interviewed. Four letters
were sent to each before considering them non-contactable.
2.6. Data collection instruments
An interviewer-administered questionnaire with 56 mainly
structured closed-ended questions covering demographics and
risk factors was developed, reviewed by external experts in injury
prevention, and pre-tested. Trained interviewers averaged about
30 min per subject.
2.7. Data analysis
Data were doubly entered and compared for keystroke errors,
then transferred to SPSS for analysis.
3. Results
3.1. Study subjects and response
During 1961–1994, 171 individuals with cervical SCI from
diving were identiﬁed by hospitals; 8 were deceased, including
5 injured during 1961–1970 and 2 in 1971–1980. The aver-
age number of cases per year during 1961–1994 was 4.8, an
annual incidence of 0.75 per million population at the two hos-
pitals. For 1995–2004, the average number per year was 4.0,
an annual incidence of 0.53 per million. Of the 163 victims
alive during the ﬁrst part of the study in 1996, 68 (42%) par-
ticipated, and in 2004–2005, 21 of 40 eligible patients (52%)
took part. Hence, total subjects were 89 and overall response
rate excluding the deceased was 44% (89/203). Complete infor-
mation was available for 87; two questionnaires were lost. By
year of SCI, the ﬁnal sample included: 5 from 1961–1970, 18
from 1971–1980, 24 from 1981–1990, 32 from 1991–2000, and
8 from 2001–2004.
3.2. Personal risk factors
Study participants were predominantly male ( Table 2 ). The
youngest was 12 years old when injured; 85% were <35 and
95% <45. While 56% had taken swimming training, only 33%
had training in water safety and only 37% had been aware of
the risk of SCI associated with head-ﬁrst diving prior to injury.
Most had been swimming at least weekly during summer. While
31% had at least some university education, only 13% of parents
did. As for drugs, alcohol consumption at the time of injury was
self-reported by 47% and other drugs by 3%.

About half of SCIs happened in pools and half in natural
bodies of water, mainly in rural locations ( Table 3 ). The envi-
ronment was new for 42% of victims, whose dive was their ﬁrst
at the site. Darkness was reported in 30% of incidents.

Lakes were the most frequent natural body of water for SCIs,
and docks or wharfs the most frequent site of dives into natural
bodies ( Table 4 ). Poor visibility of the bottom was noted in 70%
of cases. 79% of dives took place in water ≤1.4 m deep.
3.4. Equipment factors
Equipment factors were mainly pertinent for pool incidents
(Table 5 ). Above-ground pools accounted for 57%, and 77% of
them had a terrace. While 51% of dives originated from the pool
edge, 16% were from a diving board and 9% from high locations
such as a roof or second-ﬂoor balcony. Of considerable concern,
three of the victims reported diving from diving boards where
pool depth was 2.74 m (9 ft) or deeper. The most frequent site
of impact was the up-slope between deep and shallow ends.
Most SCIs occurred in single-unit home pools, and most at one
owned by friends rather than at home. 76% of pool victims said
the bottom was visible, which contrasts with low visibility at
natural sites. In 52%, depth was ≤1.4 m at site of impact. Visible
indicators prohibiting diving or warning of depth were absent
from all but a few pools. There were no signiﬁcant trends in the
proportion of SCIs that occurred in pools during the period of
the study.
4. Discussion
Diving SCIs are an enormous burden for patients and their
families, and very costly for taxpayers, since most victims suf-
fer tetraplegia, mainly complete. In the United States, lifetime
costs for a 25 year-old with high tetraplegia average $US2.8
million ($C3.1 m), compared with $US1.6 m for a 50 year-old
(NSCISC, 2005, 2006 ). The greatest costs are incurred in the
ﬁrst year after injury, averaging $US0.7 m for high tetraplegia.
During 1999–2004, the average annual number of new cervical
SCIs from diving was 12 in Quebec (Danielle Forest, Ministry of
Health of Quebec, unpublished personal communication, 2004).

If injuries remain unchecked, and one assumes expenses approx-
imate those in the United States, they will cost the province about
$C300 m per decade.
Since economic costs and suffering are extremely high for
diving SCIs, and all should be preventable, even a single case
must be considered unacceptable. It is essential for researchers
and policy makers to introduce and evaluate interventions. It is
justiﬁable to dedicate at least a proportion of the millions that
such injuries cost annually to research and prevention, provided
they are evaluated and proven effective. Encouraging measures
that shift the burden of funding research and prevention of diving
SCIs at home pools from governments to pool vendors, or to a
coalition of pool manufacturers and vendors, insurance compa-
nies, water safety organizations, and government is desirable
since this consumer product, the pool, is the single greatest
source of diving SCI in Quebec, and probably elsewhere in
Canada.Risk factors for injury are frequently studied using various
injury matrices devised by Haddon ( Haddon, 1980, 1968 ), which
evolved from the classic epidemiologic triad of host, agent and
environment. As we use it, the matrix includes personal, equip-
ment, and environmental factors on one axis and the pre-event,
event, and post-event phases of an injury incident on the other
(Barss et al., 1998 ). Since much of Haddon’s work involved
trafﬁc safety, the equipment element was denoted by the more
speciﬁc term vehicle factors, or vector, but not by the etiologi-
cal agent, which is for diving kinetic energy and for drowning
blockage of energy processes.
4.1. Equipment and environmental risk factors for diving
SCI
In the context of pool safety, equipment can be causal as in
pools that are too short or shallow for safe diving and protective
as with longer deeper pools providing safer diving or automati-
cally closing and latching gates that avert drowning by excluding
small children. Since it is mainly 1–4 year olds who drown in
home pools, making pools deeper will probably not change that
risk – only automatic gates are likely to do so. Barriers may also
help to alert divers and all pool users that they have entered a
potentially hazardous zone, and also to avert diving into at least
certain hazardous natural sites.
Equipment factors are highly pertinent to prevention of diving
SCIs, since in Quebec at the time of the research half occurred in
a consumer product, swimming pools. Current preventive factors
for pools act mainly in the pre-event phase. A fundamental issue
is whether most standard pools are safe for diving under any
conditions, especially for the average recreational user. Current
designs are generally planned with a view to aesthetics, together
with limitations of space, depth, and cost, rather than for safety
to prevent diving SCIs and drownings. Even children undergoing
diving training at recommended minimum depths achieved head
velocities capable of causing cervical spine injury to an adult
(Blanksby et al., 1996, 1997; Blitvich et al., 2003a,b ). Swimming
pool safety, including prevention of both drownings and diving
SCIs, is an important issue for Quebec. During 1991–2000 47%
of 121 pool drownings of 1–4-year-old children in Canada were
in this province, which has 24% of the country’s population but
about half of the pools ( Barss, 2006 ).
In our survey, above-ground pools predominated. Most were
ﬁtted with an elevated terrace or patio at water level – such sur-
faces facilitate diving as well as access by toddlers from adjacent
living spaces of the home. These pools are very hazardous for
diving because they are too shallow for deep dives and of insuf-
ﬁcient length for shallow-entry ones; exposure to risk is high
since they are the most frequent variety in Quebec. Evidently
there is an alarming lack of awareness among young people
regarding the danger of such pools. It was astounding that indi-
viduals dove from sites such as roofs, windows, and second-ﬂoor
balconies with or without alcohol: such events demonstrate that
pool users have not learned the hazards of diving headﬁrst. Sim-
ilar behaviour was also reported from the United States three
decades ago ( Green et al., 1980 ).

As several SCIs occurred during dives from a diving board
in both our series and two earlier studies from the United King-
dom ( Frankel et al., 1980 ) and the United States ( Green et al.,
1980 ), evidently boards are installed on pools with deep ends
that are actually neither sufﬁciently deep nor long for diving.
The up-slope, “quad wall” or “spinal wall” ( Blanksby et al.,
1997, 1996; Zader, 1998 ), of so-called hopper pools is the point
of impact for most diving SCIs. Hence, even for in-ground pools
it is doubtful that current designs are adequate in depth or length
for safe diving, especially for adult males. Many men are tall
and heavy, so the kinetic energy of impact onto a pool up-slope
is high. On the basis of experimental studies published as early
as 1975, it was recommended that one should not dive into water
less than twice one’s height ( Albrand and Walter, 1975 ). If we
compare the necessary depth for 1.22 metre (4 ft) and 1.83 m
(6 ft) tall individuals, the difference is 1.22 m. Few, if any, home
pools meet this requirement of 3.7 m depth for a moderately
tall adult male. This early research-based recommendation is
worth remembering during assessment of old and new model
regulations for depth and length of pools.
It is also essential to consider depth at the location of maxi-
mum dive depth since the deepest point in the dive is at a distance
from the point of entry, and pool depth is more relevant at this
point than where entry occurs. If the deep end is short, a diving
board extends over it for a metre, and the diver leaves it at an
angle, actual depth at entry will be much less than the maximum
at the deep end.
Experimental research ( Blitvich et al., 1999 ) showed that in
dives from the pool deck, the distance covered to maximum
depth averaged 3.42 m with a maximum of 5.75. Dives from
competitive blocks at a height of 0.75 m averaged 4.02 m with a
maximum of 5.96. If we add a metre of diving board extension to
these maximums, evidently maximum depth could be reached
at a distance of up to about 7 m (23 ft), from the edge of the
deep end of a pool, or 6 m from the tip of the diving board. A
typical design obtained, with difﬁculty, from a vendor for in-
ground home pools in Quebec showed a total length of only
8.8 m. Hence, a diver might reach maximum depth at a point up
to 80% along the length of such a pool.
It is probably too ambitious for most home pools to be
designed for both safe diving and swimming. In response to
a million dollar quad wall SCI jury verdict in 1970, research
was commissioned in the early 1970s by the United States
pool industry’s former national trade association, the National
Pool and Spa Institute (NSPI). The unpublished, indeed sup-
pressed, results showed that the cheap, “hopper-bottom” pools
designed to ﬁt an average residential backyard were too small
for safety ( Zader, 1998 ). The deepest portion constituted as lit-
tle as 4% of the surface area. Exactly as we suspected from
the present interview research in Quebec together with obser-
vation of plans for new in-ground pools being marketed there
in the late 1990s, the experimental research reported to NSPI
in 1974 had demonstrated that water between the tip of div-
ing boards and the quad wall was insufﬁcient to decelerate
a tall heavy athletic male. After losing a $US8 million set-
tlement plus interest lawsuit and appeal to a teenager who
sustained tetraplegia from an SCI in a hopper-bottom poolin 1998, NSPI immediately declared bankruptcy, became the
International Aquatics Foundation (IAF), and no longer pub-
lishes norms ( Zader, 1998 ). Hundreds if not thousands of
diving SCIs in Canada, not to mention the United States,
could probably have been averted if the NSPI’s research, con-
ducted at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s pool, had
been immediately published and new safety standards insti-
gated.
It is noteworthy that in the city of Toronto in Canada’s largest
province, Ontario, research showed that during 1948–1973, 11%
of 358 SCIs were from diving, but that only 1 of 36 diving SCIs
occurred in a pool, with all others in lakes in this region of cot-
tage country ( Tator et al., 1981 ). The authors went on to note a
remarkable trend: during the subsequent years 1974–1979, half
of the victims of diving SCI in their acute unit had been injured
in pools. The paper recommended educational programmes and
warning signs and concluded as follows: “Reckless diving must
be considered as one of summer’s main hazards.” Other publi-
cations by the same author in Toronto conﬁrmed the importance
of diving as the source of 11–12% of all SCIs and 52–70% of
sport/recreational SCI (sport/recreational cases represented 18%
of all SCIs), but since most incidents had occurred in lakes, rec-
ommendations focused on personal factors and warning signs
rather than pool factors ( Tator and Edmonds, 1979; Tator et
al., 1993 ). A more recent study, 1997–2001, from another less
metropolitan region of the province showed only 9% of all SCI
from sport/recreation ( Pickett et al., 2006 ). The difference could
be due to a different urban/rural mix or to a wider trend towards
greater safety in sport.
In retrospect, it appears likely, but deserves further study, that
the reason for the sudden change in the epidemiology of diving
SCI in Toronto was the introduction of a new hazardous product.
As hopper pools had proliferated across the United States, so did
quad wall SCIs. NSPI’s attorney, William Ginsburg, helped cre-
ate a product liability committee to devise a defence for members
against lawsuits from diving SCI. Prior to their big loss in 1998
his ﬁrm successfully defended hundreds of diving injury cases
using the strategy of always blaming the diver ( Zader, 1998 ).
Indeed, since the incidence of diving injury in Canada and the
United States has been about double that in Europe in recent
decades ( Table 1 ), a possible cause of this intercontinental geo-
graphic variability could have been higher exposure to unsafe
home pools. Supporting this, there was some improvement in
diving SCIs in the United States in the late 1990’s compared
with earlier years ( DeVivo, 2003 ).
There are unfortunately no model provincial regulations in
Quebec for in-ground home swimming pools. Only public pools
must conform to such norms, included in Le r` eglement sur la
s´ecurit´ e dans les bains publics which governs depth of water
at the end of the diving board (plummet) and other issues ( GQ,
2007 ). Depth at plummet is ﬁxed at 2.7 m for a diving board of
0.5 m or less above the water, 3.0 m for a board more than 0.5 and
less than 1.0 m above the water, for a half-circle of 3.0 m from
the end of the board. Such a norm would be expected to reduce
the risk of striking the up-slope but in view of the evidence cited
earlier and other norms below a depth greater than 3 m, extending
5–6 m beyond the plummet, would be more appropriate.

Model regulations for public or other pools where diving
is permitted could not be found on the internet for Canadian
Standards (CSA) or for individual provinces, with the exception
of British Columbia, which for a board at deck level, requires
a depth of only 2.4 m (8 ft) at the plummet, 2.7 m (9 ft) at the
deepest point, and a distance from the plummet to the beginning
of the upslope of only 2.4 m (8 ft) ( GBC, 2007 ). The F ´ed´eration
Internationale de Natation – International Swimming Federation
(FINA) – recommends 3.5 m (11.5 ft) depth at the plummet and
3.4 m (11.2 ft) depth for at least 5.0 m (16.4 ft) from the plummet
of a one-metre springboard ( FINA, 2007 ). FINA standards as
cited in a 1980 paper on SCI ( Frankel et al., 1980 ) were less
demanding, and required a depth at the plummet for recreational
diving of only 2.6 m (8.5 ft), with this distance to be maintained
forward for only 3.0 m (9.8 ft).
In a study from the United Kingdom in the 1970s ( Frankel et
al., 1980 ), 35% of SCIs from diving had occurred in pools, of
which 46% occurred at the shallow end, but 21% at the deep end
from the diving board. In another study from the United States
around the same time, 53% of diving SCIs in pools occurred
in the shallow ends of in-ground pools or into above-ground
pools, but 15% involved dives from boards ( Green et al., 1980 ).
The more recent FINA norms are clearly an improvement and
might have averted such SCIs if applied to all pools with div-
ing boards, but whether they are adequate for pools used by
untrained recreational divers merits further study. Nonetheless,
they do come close to meeting the 1975 experimentally based
recommendations described above ( Albrand and Walter, 1975 ).
The absence of norms for residential pools facilitates sale and
installation of pools that are neither sufﬁciently deep nor with
adequate distance between the end of the board and the up-slope.
Hence, in usual short home pools of ≤9 m (30 ft) long, the depth
where a diver’s head reaches the up-slope will be much shallower
than at the middle of the deep end; even the deep end is as shallow
as 2.4 m (8 ft) in some pools. Unless a pool is completely ﬁlled,
actual water depth will be less than pool depth and the distance
from the tip of the diving board or pool edge to the surface,
and therefore acceleration and the resulting kinetic energy to be
dissipated by the water, will be greater. Since the kinetic energy
transferred to the cervical spine in striking the head directly
against a steep up-slope would be considerably greater than a
glancing blow off a shallow bottom, gradual gradients rather
than a sudden change could be safer since some untrained pool
users will inevitably dive in.
Although it is difﬁcult to imagine it could compensate for
inadequate pool dimensions, an event-phase protective equip-
ment factor could be an energy-absorbing surface for the deep
end and pool up-slope. Energy absorbing surfaces are already
used in many consumer products such as playground surfaces
and various parts of automobiles where a head or other body
part may impact; experimental studies would be necessary to
determine the effectiveness of such an approach.
Protective pre-event phase equipment includes signs to indi-
cate depth and alert users that a pool is unsafe for diving. Such
signs were uncommon at pools in this study. During a visit to a
large pool store, we observed a tiny warning sign on the rim of an
above-ground pool that would have been illegible to someonestanding on a terrace level with its edge. Evaluation of vari-
ous signs to verify whether typical users such as young males
unfamiliar with the pool actually noticed and understood them
during day and night conditions – and modiﬁed their behaviour
– is essential. Since our results show that the pool bottom is
usually visible, large ﬂuorescent warnings and depth indicators
at this site might be obvious to most potential divers. Research
has shown that typical no-diving signs are seldom noticed and
even when they are may actually provoke unsafe behaviour
such as diving into shallow water ( Goldhaber and deTurck,
1988 ). Hence, research-based guidelines ( Wogalter et al., 2002 )
should be followed and safety warning signs evaluated objec-
tively among the appropriate target group of young males. The
difﬁculty in designing effective signs lends further support to the
need for pools that are also designed to be as safe as possible,
on the basis of sound transparent research.
As for SCIs in natural bodies of water , the main site of dives
was docks or wharfs, both of which are modiﬁable products.
Since most dives were into shallow water, barriers should be
installed at hazardous locations where people might be tempted
to dive, or dock areas dredged to provide a safer depth. Barriers
at such locations, and at pools, could be designed in such a
manner as to alert people that they have moved into an area of
increased risk. Warning signs might be useful, bearing in mind
the requirements and limitations of such devices ( Goldhaber and
deTurck, 1988; Wogalter et al., 2002 ).
Visibility is an environmental risk factor, and poor visibility
of the bottom was reported for SCIs from most dives at natural
sites. For SCIs at both pools and natural sites, 30% occurred at
dusk or after dark; only a few pools were well-lit. During the
day, pool bottoms were generally visible, but this did not appear
to have deterred the victims. It could be that prominent depth
markers on the bottom and sides of pools are necessary for valid
perception of depth, even when the bottom is visible. The impact
of colours used for pool bottoms on depth perception needs to
be assessed. Guidelines for colour, size, and placement of depth
markers and for lighting of pools are included in regulations for
public pools in Quebec ( GQ, 2007 ), and might be useful for
home pools if they are evidence-based.
4.2. Personal risk factors for diving SCI
As for personal or host factors, in our study, as in others,
males 15–44-years-old were the main risk group ( NSCISC,
2005, 2006; Djerrari, 2000; O’Connor, 2002; RCIS, 2006;
Grifﬁths, 1980; Aito et al., 2005 ). Most modiﬁable host factors
pertain to the pre-event phase. Although most victims were fre-
quent swimmers, few reported that they were aware of the hazard
of diving headﬁrst. This suggests that although half had received
swimming and one-third water-safety training, it was inadequate
for prevention of diving SCIs. Alcohol is a risk factor for many
injuries, and diving SCIs are no exception, with consumption
prior to the incident reported by half; similar results have been
found elsewhere ( Blanksby et al., 1997 ). An experimental study
showed progressive deterioration in performance of recreational
divers beginning at 40 mg% blood alcohol ( Perrine et al., 1994 ),
half the legal limit for driving a car in Canada. Divers were

794 P . Barss et al. / Accident Analysis and Prevention 40 (2008) 787–797
unaware of their poor performance and increased risk of injury.
Furthermore, a positive correlation between severity of SCI and
blood alcohol level has been reported ( Forchheimer et al., 2005 ).
While feet-ﬁrst entry is to be preferred, and should be strongly
recommended in home pools, many recreational swimmers do
want to and will dive in certain situations. Hence, training in the
safest diving techniques should be covered. A study of recre-
ational swimmers found that in 18% of dives, the swimmer
pulled his/her arms backward in a breaststroke motion leaving
head and neck unprotected ( Blitvich, 2006 ). Variables of a dive
that affect risk include depth of dive, ﬂight distance, angle of
entry, and velocity at maximum depth ( Blitvich et al., 1999 ).
Variables of technique include locking hands together to pre-
vent them being forced apart by water pressure, locking arms
together against the head to lock the head , and steering-up skills
to minimize depth and distance at depth. A study of diving train-
ing in Australia showed that six 10-min sessions were sufﬁcient
to provide recreational swimmers with skills to make shallow
dives and to lock the arms onto the head; skills were retained at
least 20 months ( Blitvich et al., 2000, 2003a,b ).
4.3. Limitations
Some limitations of this study should be noted. Despite up
to four efforts to contact all patients, our response rate was
relatively low at 44% of victims believed alive. This may, how-
ever, reﬂect the retrospective study period necessary to recruit
sufﬁcient patients for meaningful study. Furthermore, limiting
the study to two rehabilitation hospitals could have excluded
some subjects treated at general or paediatric facilities. Indeed,the incidence at the two hospitals was much less than reported
by MedEcho, as Table 1 evidences. There may have been a bias
in type of individuals lost to follow-up, including more severe
injuries or older individuals. We did verify trends in the propor-
tion of pools involved and did not detect signiﬁcant change in this
variable during the study period. In addition, long recall periods
may have affected validity of some responses: participants might
have underreported alcohol, and we did not assess diving related
injuries or fatalities other than hospitalization for cervical SCI.
We had originally planned to compare pools where diving SCI
occurred with control pools, and victims with control divers, but
were unable to do this; it could be useful for future studies. Bet-
ter exposure measures such as estimates of the number of dives
per year into pools of different depths and the numbers of pools
of different depths might also prove worthwhile. It would have
been useful to inquire about factors such as whether victims
had their arms out in front of them, locked or loose and whether
water safety and swimming training had included details about
key elements of diving safety. Since SCI represents only about
20% of all diving/jumping into water injuries in Quebec and
elsewhere in Canada, investigation of other injuries would also
be beneﬁcial ( Djerrari, 2000 ). Unfortunately, external cause
codes in ICD 9 and ICD 10 classify diving and jumping together,
complicating analysis ( World Health Organization, 1978, 1992 )
4.4. Recommendations
Table 6 summarises recommendations for prevention of SCI
from diving, and is followed by more detailed consideration.
Table 6
Recommended interventions to prevent SCI from diving
Equipment risk factors
Model consumer protection regulations for home and other swimming pools:
•Establish province-wide, nation-wide, and international research-based norms of diving safety design parameters for low-risk home, public pools, and other
pools.
•Prohibit sale of diving boards for usual home pools, and any other pools that do not meet research-based criteria and norms of low-risk pools for diving.
•Discourage sale/use/purchase of home pools that have a deep end combined with an up-slope.
•Ensure that vendors are required to be properly trained and to train purchasers in pool safety, including the hazards of head-ﬁrst entry.
•Implement codes to include warning signs prohibiting diving, that are highly visible and proven to be effective among young males in all lighting conditions.
•Include depth indicators in codes, certiﬁed visible in all lighting conditions.
•Use municipal aerial surveillance with photographs to identify potentially risky pools, followed up with ground surveillance by inspectors, for both diving
SCIs and automatic gates to prevent child drowning
Personal risk factors
•Implement research-based comprehensive swimming and water safety, including diving safety, programmes for all children and youth.
•Incorporate water safety into swimming programs, including the hazards of headﬁrst entry and limitations of most pools, to ensure water competence
(Brenner et al., 2006 ).
•Reach high-risk individuals, including male youth, by mandatory comprehensive evidence-based training in water competence by health curriculum or
physical education at schools.
•Encourage feet-ﬁrst entry into pools and natural sites.
•Discourage diving in home pools and other pools that do not meet criteria of low-risk diving.
Teach three key elements to those who insist on diving:
•Diving environment must be known to be reasonably safe, i.e., certiﬁed on the basis of safety criteria as low-risk for diving by experts.
•Diving should be undertaken only by individuals trained in safer diving skills.
•Alcohol must be completely avoided by all divers, since diving skills and awareness of risk deteriorate at even low blood alcohol levels.
Environmental risk factors
•Mandate pool lighting that ensures the entire bottom of pool is clearly visible.
•Ensure water sufﬁciently clear so that bottom is visible.

The best chance for success in reaching the greatest num-
ber of persons is probably via comprehensive evidence-based
swimming and water safety programmes. Programmes such as
those provided by organizations like Red Cross would preferably
reach all young people in communities across the country and
incorporate training not easily forgotten. All organizations that
provide diving safety teaching must ensure that training materi-
als and instructors are regularly updated on the basis of the best
available research evidence.
To reach high-risk individuals schools could be required to
include water safety and swimming training in their health or
physical education curriculum. All swimming programs should
incorporate water safety to ensure water competence (Brenner
et al., 2006 ), including teaching the hazards of headﬁrst div-
ing. Regular publicity is also needed to emphasize that diving
is an activity with a high potential for injury. Training of new
pool owners in pool safety, including drowning prevention and
whether diving safely is feasible in their new pools, should
be obligatory. Vendors should perhaps also be responsible for
ensuring that the purchasers have received effective training
prior to handing over a new pool installation to them.
For swimmers who insist upon diving, at least three key ele-
ments for low-risk diving need to be taught. First, the diving
environment must be known to be reasonably safe, i.e. assessed
as meeting up-to-date safety design parameters. Few if any home
pools meet this requirement, nor do many hotel pools and nat-
ural sites. Second, since diving is a high-risk activity, it should
only be undertaken by individuals with training in safer diving
skills . Third , because diving skills and awareness of risk dete-
riorate measurably even at low blood alcohol concentrations,
all including the experienced must avoid diving after alcohol
consumption.
As for pools, historically, most private in-ground pools were,
and probably still are, built in Quebec and elsewhere according
to unofﬁcial norms 2.4 m (8 ft) deep suggested by the now-
bankrupt American National Spa and Pool Institute (NSPI). Yet,
a few years ago these “norms” were judged unsafe in a US court,
as noted in Section 4.1(Zader, 1998 ). A working study was
done in Quebec in 2006 to evaluate the possibility of designing
norms for “safe” pools equipped with a diving board, l’´Etude
de faisabilit´ e sur l’´ elaboration d’une norme pour les piscines
r´esidentielles ´ equip´ ees d’un tremplin (Rousseau and Langlais,
2006 ). It was conducted by the Bureau de normalisation du
Qu´ebec (BNQ) at the request of the Soci ´et´e de sauvetage, the
Ministry of Health and Social Services, and the Ministry of Edu-
cation, Leisure and Sport. The report is considered a working
document.
Nevertheless, since few home pools meet safety norms for
public pools, since there are many more home than public
pools and their use is largely unsupervised, and since the con-
sequences of a catastrophic diving SCI are the same wherever it
occurs, it may be safer to simply prohibit ﬁtting of diving boards
and strongly discourage diving for home pools. An exception
could be made for home pools that meet or exceed international
safety design requirements for low-risk diving public pools,
such as those of FINA ( FINA, 2007 ). Furthermore, since many
SCIs occur at a pronounced up-slope and some individuals willinevitably dive into home pools, hopper-type pools should be
banned and only pools with a gradual up-slope accepted. This
could also help avoid drownings among waders who are non-
swimmers. Similar considerations should apply to hotel and
other pools.
All the foregoing leads us to suggest adoption of province-
wide, nation-wide, and indeed international norms for private
pools similar to existing ones for public pools, provided
the norms for public pools are evidence-based. Such norms,
as has been the case for automatic pool gates to prevent
child drownings, may be resisted by pool vendors. Due to
costs of deeper and longer excavations and to space limita-
tions, vendors tend to lobby for shallow in-ground pools with
short deep ends. Nevertheless, many now-standard safety mea-
sures for other hazards were initially resisted by industry:
examples include automatic protection for vehicle occupants,
such as airbags, seatbelts, and intrusion-resistant frames.
Some municipalities in Australia now use aerial surveil-
lance with photographs to identify pools, followed up by
inspectors who verify the presence of the appropriate safety
gates and fences to protect small children from drowning.
Municipal surveillance of pools should be comprehensive
for both diving SCIs and drowning. Hence sound provin-
cial and federal norms of consumer protection, together
with municipal regulations and enforcement, are urgently
required for this hazardous product. While norms should
be developed to protect untrained recreational divers, they
should be complemented by universal water safety training as
key elements of population-based prevention of water-related
injuries.
