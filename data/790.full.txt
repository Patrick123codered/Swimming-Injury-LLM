Indoor swimming pools, water chlorination and respiratory health
B. Nemery *, P.H.M. Hoet *, D. Nowak#
Swimming is generally considered to be a healthy
leisure activity for both the young and old. Swimming
is even often advised as the most appropriate sport for
asthmatic children [1–3], mainly (but probably not
solely) on the grounds that inhaling moist air is less
conducive to triggering exercise-induced asthma [4].
However, for obvious reasons of microbiological safety,
the water of public and private swimming pools
must be disinfected [5]. The most common pro-
cedure for water disinfection consists of chlorination.
As with all human and technological intervention,
the use of chlorine-based products to disinfect swim-
ming water may lead to a number of unwanted effects,
in particular the presence of chlorine-containing
compounds in the air. Consequently, chlorination
may affect the respiratory health of either those who
work as swimming attendants or instructors, or those
who use the pools as customers, particularly children
and the general public, but also competitive swim-
mers. Although the issue of the chlorination of public
water supplies has received considerable attention,
mainly with regard to the presence of potentially
carcinogenic or teratogenic chlorinated by-products
[6, 7], the respiratory hazards of chlorinated swim-
ming water have been less well addressed. Thus, old
[8, 9] and even more recent [10] reports on indoor
pollution do not deal with the air of chlorinated
swimming pools, despite the generally obvious andreadily noticeable irritant character of this type of
environment, even in well-maintained pools [11].
Water chlorination
Chlorination is the most common procedure for
water disinfection of public water supplies and
swimming pools. Chlorine may be added to water as
the gaseous form (Cl
2), which rapidly hydrolyzes to
hypochlorous acid (HOCl), or as sodium or calcium
hypochlorite (NaOCl or Ca(OCl) 2). Hypochlorite, for
disinfection, may also be produced by adding so-called
hypochlorite-generating agents, such as dichloro-
isocyanurate, to water. In water with a pH between6.5–8.5, both HOCl and the hypochlorite ion (OCl-)
are present.
Acute hazards related to the chlorination of swimming
pools
Acute exposure to high levels of chlorine gas,
resulting from explosions, leaks or malfunctioning
of chlorine-disinfection installations [12–14] is a well-
known problem. The health consequences of such
incidents may be more or less serious. Severe mani-
festations depend on the intensity of the exposure
(i.e.the combination of aerial concentrations and
duration of exposure) and may include laryngeal
oedema, asthma attacks and chemical burns of the
upper and lower airway mucosa, and even chemical
pneumonitis [15]. The more frequent less seriousmanifestations include transient lachrymation and
nasopharyngeal irritation, as well as hyperventilation.
Emergency physicians should know how to deal with
these casualties, which in the case of entire school
parties may arrive in a large group with possibly more
emotion than gravity [16]. Serious inhalation injuries
must be recognized and treated accordingly, and the
possibility of structural or functional sequelae, particu-
larly reactive airways dysfunction syndrome (RADS),
must be envisaged [17]. If only for medicolegal
reasons, it seems wise not to discharge victims of
inhalation injuries without an assessment of pulmo-
nary function, including measurements of bronchial
responsiveness and diffusion capacity or blood-gas
analysis with standardized exercise. No controlled
studies have evaluated the beneﬁt of administering
systemic or inhaled corticosteroids in victims of
inhalation injuries, but it seems justiﬁed, based on
mainly anecdotal evidence and theoretical considera-
tions, to prevent excessive airway inﬂammation by
inhaled corticosteroids. It is also wise to advise a
follow-up of respiratory symptoms, spirometry and,
if necessary, nonspeciﬁc bronchial reactivity, after
6–8 weeks.
Occupational exposure to swimming-pool air
A less well-known problem is that of the possible
health effects of daily or intermittent exposures to
the "normal "indoor atmosphere of swimming pools,
which common experience proves to be as pungent
and irritating for the eyes and upper airways, as*Laboratory of Pneumology (Unit of Lung Toxicology) and

some industrial environments. The typical smell of
swimming-pool atmospheres is commonly attributed
to"chlorine "in the air. However, recent studies have
revealed, at least to the medical community, that the
smell and irritant properties of swimming-pool air are
mainly due to chloramines [18]. These chloramines,
monochloramine (NH 2Cl), dichloramine (NHCl 2) and
trichloramine (NCl 3), are generated from the reaction
of hypochlorite with ammonia and amino-compounds
that originate from sweat and urine of the swimmers.
These chloramines, and particularly the trichloramine,
are quite volatile and they partition easily from the
water into the air. The conditions that determine
production and air levels of chloramines depend,among other factors, on the degree of water chlorina-
tion, the contamination of the water by nitrogen-
containing compounds (which in turn depends on the
number of bathers, as well as their behaviour and
hygiene), water temperature and air recirculation [18,
19]. People working in such environments, such as
pool supervisors or swimming teachers, are obviously
exposed to these agents, and they may develop
respiratory symptoms [19]. However, not much is
known about the long-term health risks that these
irritants pose to employees. No health-based occupa-tional exposure limits seem to exist for chloramines,
although proposals have been made [20]. In this issue
ofthe European Respiratory Journal ,T
HICKETT et al.
[21] present three relatively well-documented cases
of occupational asthma in swimming-pool workers.
Based on the description of the patients, two of whom
had a positive bronchial provocation test to chlor-
amine in the laboratory, there is little doubt that these
people had occupational asthma. However, the
mechanism of the asthma in these persons remains
elusive and the claim that it is due to immunologicalsensitization is only supported by the fact that the
subjects appeared to react uniquely to reportedly
low levels of trichloramine. A pure irritant effect
was, therefore, considered less likely as the subjects
had no increased bronchial reactivity to histamine.
Irritant-induced asthma caused by chronic "low-level "
exposure to irritant agents is a controversial entity
for which there is still only limited epidemiological
and experimental support.
Whatever the mechanism of chloramine-related
asthma may be, the article by T
HICKETT et al. [21]
is clinically important, because it serves as evidence
that swimming pool-induced asthma may occur as anoccupational disease. There are reasons to believe that
this is not such an exceptional occurrence. Indeed,
when P.S. Burge (Dept of Respiratory Medicine,
Occupational Lung Diseases Unit, Heartlands Hospi-
tal, Birmingham, UK), the senior author of the article,
presented one of the three cases at an interac-
tive occupational grand round of the 1998 annual
European Respiratory Society meeting in Geneva
and asked "Have you seen cases of swimming-pool
asthma? ", 24% and 19% of the audience replied yes
and maybe, respectively (more than 220 participants,62% of whom spent v10% of their time dealing
with occupational lung disease; unpublished data).
Another reason why the report by T
HICKETT et al.
[21] is important is that it may have implicationsfor other types of jobs, outside swimming pools.
Cleaning also involves exposure to various types of
irritants, including bleach. Thus, casual and pro-
fessional cleaning personnel are not only at risk of
acute inhalation injury as a result of mixing incom-
patibilities (bleach with ammonia, bleach with acids)
[22–27], but recent epidemiological studies have indi-
cated that cleaners belong to a category of workers at
higher risk of asthma [28]. Although speciﬁc reactionsto cleaning agents have been described occasionally,
the causes of asthma in cleaners have remained
unidentiﬁed so far. Perhaps, the role of chloramines
should be investigated further.
Swimming and the health of swimmers
Finally, the effect of swimming-pool atmospheres
on the bathers themselves is a topic of interest. Thebeneﬁcial effects of swimming in asthmatic children
are generally attributed to the fact that breathing
moist air is less conducive to exercise-induced
bronchoconstriction than other forms of exercise [4].
However, the issue of the possible irritant exposure
resulting from water chlorination have not been
addressed or cannot be ascertained from publications
where asthmatics have undergone swimming-training
programmes [1–3, 29]. There are anecdotal indica-
tions that asthmatic persons do not always tolerate
chlorinated pools well [23, 30–32], but in general this
does not appear to constitute a major problem. There
are also indications that competitive swimmers have
more bronchial hyperresponsiveness or asthma than
other sportsmen [33, 34]. The reasons for these
observations are unknown, but irritants have been
suggested as a possible causal factor, although the
reason could include reverse causation (asthmatics
being more likely to choose swimming as a sport).
The issue of swimming and respiratory health has
recently received a great deal of attention in Belgium
with the highly publicized results of a cross-sectional
survey of schoolchildren, which claimed that swim-
ming in chlorinated pools represents a hazard of
pulmonary damage, and could even be responsible for
the recently observed increase in asthma in Western
societies [35]. These conclusions were based on the
observation that serum concentrations of pneumo-
proteins (mainly surfactant protein B (SP-B)) were
elevated in children who frequently attend chlorinated
swimming pools as compared to control children.
Swimming attendance explained a large part of the
variance in serum pneumoproteins, when otherpossible factors were taken into account, and there
was a good dose/response relationship between serum
pneumoproteins and an index of cumulative swim-
ming-pool attendance (h ?week
-1?yr), as estimated at
the level of each school. Based on extensive experience
[36], the researchers considered that such increased
levels of serum pneumoproteins reﬂected increases in
the alveolocapillary permeability and that this was an
early indication of lung injury and risk of disease.
However, no other end-points (respiratory symptoms
or pulmonary function) corroborated these ﬁndings,
but there was a close positive relationship between791 WATER CHLORINATION AND RESPIRATORY HEALTH
serum levels of SP-B and immunoglobulin-E. These
ﬁndings and their interpretation as a potentially
serious adverse health effect, led to some municipal
and school authorities cancelling swimming lessons
in primary schools. Later, experts advised the educa-
tion ministers that the results of the study did not
warrant such drastic measures. However, apart from
its disastrous risk communication, the study did point
to the need to evaluate further the possible health risksposed by chlorinated swimming pools for children
and the public. There are standards for the micro-
biological quality of the pool water, science-based
standards for the quality of the air above the water are
still needed. The available information from toxicity
testing in experimental animals is, as yet, not sufﬁcient
for this purpose [20, 37].
Until adequate information is available, appro-
priate ventilation to minimize chloramine accumula-
tion, control of water chlorination and temperature,
and adequate hygiene of bathers should be enforced
to reduce the irritant nature of swimming-pool
environments for both those who work and those
who swim there.
