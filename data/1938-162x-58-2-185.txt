Context: Shoulder pain is pervasive in swimmers of all
ages. However, given the limited number of prospective studies,
injury risk factors in swimmers remain uncertain.
Objective: To determine the extent to which the risk factors
of previous injury, poor movement competency, erroneous
freestyle swimming technique, and low perceived susceptibilityto sport injury were associated with noncontact musculoskeletal
injury in collegiate swimmers.
Design: Prospective cohort study.
Setting: College natatorium.
Patients or Other Participants: Thirty-seven National
College Athletic Association Division III swimmers (21 females,
16 males; median age ¼19 years [interquartile range ¼3 years],
height ¼175610 cm; mass ¼70.0610.9 kg).
Main Outcome Measure(s): Participants completed pre-
season questionnaires on their previous injuries and perceivedsusceptibility to sport injury. At the beginning of the season, they
completed the Movement System Screening Tool and the
Freestyle Swimming Technique Assessment. Logistic regres-sion was used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs for
the association between each risk factor and injury.
Results: Eleven of the 37 participants (29.7%) sustained an
injury. Univariate analyses identified 2 risk factors: previous
injury (OR ¼8.89 [95% CI ¼1.78, 44.48]) and crossover hand
positions during the freestyle entry phase (OR ¼8.50 [95% CI ¼
1.50, 48.05]). After adjusting for previous injury, we found that a
higher perceived percentage chance of injury (1 item from the
Perceived Susceptibility to Sport Injury) decreased the injuryodds (adjusted OR ¼0.11 [95% CI ¼0.02, 0.82]). Poor
movement competency was not associated with injury ( P..05).
Conclusions: Previous injury, a crossover hand-entry
position in freestyle, and a low perceived percentage chanceof injury were associated with increased injury odds. Ascertain-
ing injury histories and assessing for crossover positions may
help identify swimmers with an elevated injury risk and informinjury-prevention strategies.

Key Points
/C15Swimmers who exhibited a crossover hand position during the hand-entry phase of the freestyle stroke had 8.5
times higher odds of injury.
/C15After adjusting for previous injury, we observed that the odds of injury increased almost 9-fold for every 1-pointdecrease in the perceived percentage chance of injury.
/C15Poor movement competency as measured using the Movement System Screening Tool was not a risk factor forinjury.
As many as 9 in 10 competitive swimmers aged 13
to 25 years report shoulder pain.1This high
prevalence is plausible given the high training
loads and repetitive stress of the sport.1For example, at the
collegiate level, swimmers can train 6 to 7 sessions per
week for a total of .23 km.2Given the predominant
overuse mechanism of injury at the collegiate level,3,4many
swimming injuries may be preventable. To reduce the
incidence of swimming injuries, we must identify risk
factors.5The current evidence for risk factors in swimmerslacks certainty because of a paucity of prospective studies.6
Authors2,7of 2 prospective studies identiﬁed previous
injury as a risk factor for future pain or injury, but authors8
of 1 study found no relationship between previous andfuture shoulder pain. In several prospective investigations,researchers
7–12found associations between various mea-
sures of shoulder strength, endurance, or range of motion
(ROM) and injury across age groups.
Many potential risk factors for injury have not been
examined prospectively in swimmers. For example, poor

movement competency (ie, the inability to execute key
sporting movements) has been identiﬁed as a risk factoracross sports.
13–15Although swimmers have participated in
these multisport samples,13–15no researchers have assessed
the relationship between movement competency and injury
in swimmers alone. In addition, despite the widespread
belief that poor swimming technique increases injuryrisk,
16–18the authors12of only 1 peer-reviewed prospective
study have investigated this relationship. Finally, despite
the well-documented role that psychosocial factors play in
injury,19–21no prospective study of swimmers has been
conducted to assess a psychosocial measure.
Additional prospective studies are needed to better
understand risk factors for swimming injuries, particularly
in collegiate swimmers, who have been the subject of only
2 prospective studies.2,10Many researchers have restricted
their investigations to shoulder injuries.7–12However, at the
collegiate level, most injuries (an estimated 65% to 70%)
affect body regions other than the shoulders.3,4Therefore,
we conducted a prospective study of collegiate swimmers
to determine the extent to which 4 intrinsic risk factors
were associated with noncontact musculoskeletal injury
throughout the body. These risk factors were previous
injury, poor movement competency, erroneous freestyleswimming technique, and low perceived susceptibility to
injury. We hypothesized that each risk factor would be
associated with increased odds of injury.
METHODS
Participants
A total of 41 National College Athletic Association
(NCAA) Division III swimmers from 1 men’s team and 1women’s team took part in this prospective cohort study.
We recruited participants during a preseason team meeting
and included them in the study if they were /C2118 years old
and medically cleared to engage in sport. We excluded
those who could not speak English or provide consent. This
study was conducted in parallel with another study
involving the same participants in which we investigatedthe relationship between workload and injury.
22We
calculated the sample size for this study based on the need
for a minimum of 10 injuries to perform logistic
regression.23Given the injury incidence for the team from
the previous season (27%), the calculation yielded aminimum of 37 participants. All participants provided
informed consent, and the Drexel University Institutional
Review Board approved this study (1806006428A001).
Procedures
During the preseason, participants completed a question-
naire on their injury history and the Perceived Susceptibil-ity to Sport Injury (PSSI) instrument via the Research
Electronic Data Capture web application (REDCap;
Vanderbilt University). Excerpts of the injury history
questionnaire and the PSSI questionnaire are provided in
Supplemental Figures 1 and 2, respectively. The injury
history questionnaire asked participants to describe all
injuries they had sustained in the past 5 years for 11 bodyregions from head to feet. Although the injury history
questionnaire has not been validated, the lead author
(T.R.P.) created it with input from coauthors (M.W. andJ.A.T.) with expertise in injury epidemiology. In the
preseason questionnaire, participants also answered 4questions on the PSSI.
24,25On 5-point Likert-type scales,
they rated their (1) chance of injury (belief), (2)susceptibility to injury (feeling), (3) percentage chance ofinjury (numeric), and (4) chance of injury compared withteammates (comparative). They also answered a questionabout their perceived ability to reduce risk (preventability).The sum of the responses to the ﬁrst 4 questions yielded atotal score for the PSSI out of 20.
24In a previous study of
collegiate student-athletes, Gnacinski et al25conﬁrmed the
factorial validity of the PSSI total score.
During the ﬁrst week of the season, participants
completed the Movement System Screening Tool (MSST),
a recently developed movement competency assessment.26
The original version of the MSST consisted of 16
component tests (MSST16). For the present study, weexcluded 2 of the component tests, namely, the side bridgewith active hip abduction and clinical core control test,because of poor construct validity and poor known-groupvalidity, respectively.
26,27We also modiﬁed the names of
some MSST16 test items for the 14-item version of theMSST (MSST14) to reﬂect the names commonly used inthe literature. In this study, participants completed theMSST14 in groups of 8 to 11 in circuit fashion. Ninephysical therapists (including D.E. and S.P.S.), 4 doctoralstudents, and 1 undergraduate student with various degreesof experience each rated 1 component test of the MSST14.Raters underwent 1 training session with the lead author forthe test they administered. During data collection, the leadauthor periodically audited each rater to ensure dataﬁdelity. For the MSST16, interrater reliability was
moderate to perfect for the component scores and excellent
for the total score (intraclass correlation coefﬁcient [ICC](2,1)¼0.94; 95% CI ¼0.91, 0.96).
26Although we did not
assess the reliability of our raters, previous researchers28–30
investigating movement competency reported minimaldifferences in reliability among raters with various levelsof experience. We administered and scored the MSST14 asdescribed earlier.
26We scored 7 of the component tests
qualitatively on a 4-point (range ¼0–3 points) ordinal scale.
We scored the other 7 tests on continuous scales (eg,distance, ROM, time, and number of repetitions) andconverted the scores to a 4-point (range ¼0–3 points)
ordinal scale based on performance relative to normativedata.
26Higher scores denoted better performance, and a
score of zero denoted pain during a test, regardless ofperformance. Nine of the 14 tests were bilateral, yielding amaximum total score of 69 points.
26The MSST14 testing
required 1 hour per group.
Over the ﬁrst month of the season, we conducted the
Freestyle Swimming Technique Assessment (FSTA) duringnormal swim practice (Figure 1).
31The FSTA detects the
presence of 7 errors in freestyle technique that may exposethe shoulder to provocative positions.
16,18We adapted the
FSTA for real-time, poolside use based on previouslydescribed methods involving above- and underwatercameras.
16,18The test-retest reliability of the individual
errors and total score have been reported as moderate (ICC[3,1]¼0.68; 95% CI ¼0.43, 0.83).
31In this study, we
modiﬁed the interpretation of the arm recovery errorcompared with our earlier examination of reliability.
31
Given that we focused on injury risk in this study, we

considered a high-elbow recovery to be an error. A high-
elbow recovery has the potential to put the glenohumeral
joint into a position of end-range internal rotation (Figure
1), whereas a straight-arm recovery (wrist higher thanelbow) tends to avoid this error.
16To minimize observer
effects, participants were not aware of when they were
being assessed. The lead author, a doctoral student in healthand rehabilitation sciences and a former collegiate
swimmer with 7 years of swimming experience, served as
the rater. Six of the 7 errors were bilateral, resulting in a
maximum total error score of 13.
Throughout the season, the swim coach reported injuries
every 2 weeks. We deﬁned an injury as any noncontact
musculoskeletal pain that resulted from team activities and
prevented the swimmer from participating in a competitionor at least 50% of 1 practice as prescribed. Because
swimmers often continue training despite pain,
17we
deﬁned injury this way to include pain that substantially
interfered with participation. This deﬁnition is comparable
with the deﬁnition of interfering shoulder pain in a previousprospective study,
7only with a precise interference
threshold (50%). Injured participants (based on the
coaches’ report) veriﬁed the injury, mechanism, andseverity via REDCap. In addition, at the midpoint and
end of the season, participants described any injuries they
had not reported earlier. Although electronic medical
records are the norm for NCAA injury surveillance,
32the
college’s athletic trainers discouraged querying theirrecords because of the potential for underreporting. The
variables collected during the 2018–2019 season are
summarized in Figure 2.
Data and Statistical Analysis
We assessed differences in demographics between
swimmers who did and those who did not sustain an injury
using the Fisher exact test (sex and training group), Mann-
Whitney Utest (age, months per year swum, and weekly
training volume), and independent-samples ttest (height,
body mass, body mass index, and swimming experience).
We investigated 4 risk factors: previous injury and total
scores on the MSST14, FSTA, and PSSI. We used
univariate logistic regression to assess the associationsbetween the 4 risk factors (independent variables) and
noncontact musculoskeletal injury (binary dependent var-iable). To ensure the relevance and severity of previous
injuries, we considered only musculoskeletal injuries from
the 2 years before the study, regardless of injurymechanism, that either caused in-season time loss oroccurred during the off-season. We included earlier injuriesfrom non–swimming-related activities because of theirpotential to affect swimming (eg, a previous anteriorcruciate ligament tear affecting the breaststroke kick). Weincluded off-season injuries to be conservative because theseverity of those injuries could not be characterized basedon time loss.
To identify a subset of items that could be used to
determine injury risk, we also conducted univariate logisticregression to assess the associations between each MSST14
component test, FSTA error, and PSSI question and injury.
For bilateral MSST14 component tests, the lower of thescores for the left and right sides of the body constituted thecomponent test score. We used odds ratios (ORs) with 95%CIs to compare low scores (0 or 1) with high scores (2 or 3).For FSTA errors, scores represented the number of sides onwhich the error was present (ie, 0, 1, or 2). We used ORs tocompare an error on either or both sides (score ¼1o r2 )
with no error (score ¼0). We treated PSSI responses (range
¼1–5) as ordinal data. To assess for confounding, we
calculated a point-biserial correlation coefﬁcient ( r

determine the correlation between previous injury and PSSImeasures. For PSSI measures that were correlated withprevious injury, we used multiple logistic regression toassess the possibility that prior injury confounded theassociation between PSSI and injury (based on a change incrude to adjusted OR of at least 10%). Additionally, wecalculated the sensitivity and speciﬁcity of dichotomizedrisk factors that were statistically signiﬁcant. The mean 6
SD was used to describe normally distributed data, and the
median (interquartile range [IQR]) was used to describe
data that were not normally distributed. We used SPSS(version 24.0; IBM Corp) for all statistical analyses. The a
level was set at .05.
RESULTS
Before the halfway point of the season, 4 participants
withdrew from the team (reasons not disclosed to theresearchers), leaving a sample size of 37. The swim coach
reported injuries every 2 weeks. Participants returned 95%
(140/148) of the 4 in-season injury questionnaires we sentvia REDCap. Of the 37 participants, 11 (29.7%) sustainedan injury. We found no differences in demographics,training groups, months per year swum, weekly trainingvolume,
22or swimming experience between swimmers who
did and those who did not sustain an injury (Table 1). Seveninjuries were to the shoulder (3 right, 4 left), 3 were to theFigure 2. Overview of the risk factors and outcomes assessed

back or sacroiliac joint, and 1 was to the knee. The
participants self-reported overuse mechanisms for all but 1
injury (a sacroiliac joint strain that occurred while
stretching). The median number of affected participation
days was 2 (range ¼1 day to 2 weeks).
Injury History
On the injury history questionnaire, 14 individuals
described a musculoskeletal injury in the previous 2 years
(11 in-season, 3 off-season). Of those 14, 8 sustained an
injury in the current season (3 to the same body region, 5 to
other regions). The odds of injury in the current season
were 8.89 times higher (95% CI ¼1.78, 44.48) in those with
an earlier injury than in those with no earlier injury. The
sensitivity and speciﬁcity of previous injury for injury
prediction were 0.73 (95% CI ¼0.39, 0.94) and 0.77 (95%
CI¼0.56, 0.91), respectively.
Movement System Screening Tool
On the MSST14, the mean 6SD score was 48 68 for
participants who sustained an injury compared with 45 66
for injury-free participants. Neither the MSST14 total
scores (OR ¼1.06 [95% CI ¼0.95, 1.18]) nor the
component tests were associated with injury ( P..05;
Table 2). Given that the ﬁndings at the component level
were not signiﬁcant, we could not identify a subset of
component MSST tests for injury-risk appraisal.
Freestyle Swimming Technique Assessment
On the FSTA, the mean 6SD score was 4 61 for
individuals who sustained an injury compared with 3 62
for injury-free individuals. The FSTA total scores were not
associated with injury (OR ¼1.26 [95% CI ¼0.79, 2.01]).
However, swimmers who exhibited a crossover hand
position during the hand-entry phase of the freestyle stroke
(n¼9; 4 unilateral, 5 bilateral) on 1 or both sides had
higher odds of injury (OR ¼8.50 [95% CI ¼1.50, 48.05])than swimmers whose hands entered the water lateral to
their midline. The sensitivity and speciﬁcity of thecrossover hand position for injury prediction were 0.82(95% CI ¼0.48, 0.97) and 0.65 (95% CI ¼0.44, 0.83],
respectively. None of the other FSTA errors wereassociated with injury ( P..05; Table 3).
Perceived Susceptibility to Sport Injury
The mean 6SD PSSI score was 11 63 for participants
who sustained an injury compared with 12 63 for injury-
free participants. Neither the PSSI total score (OR ¼0.94
[95% CI ¼0.74, 1.19]) nor any of the individual PSSI item
scores were associated with injury in univariate models ( P
..05; Table 4). However, we observed correlations
between previous injury and PSSI total score ( rpb¼0.34, P
¼.03) and previous injury and PSSI score ( rpb¼0.42, P¼
.01). After adjusting for previous injury, we still found no
association between the PSSI total score and injury
(adjusted OR ¼0.75 [95% CI ¼0.54, 1.06]). Nonetheless,
in the adjusted model, swimmers with higher numericPSSI scores had decreased odds of injury (adjusted OR ¼
0.11 [95% CI ¼0.02, 0.82]). Expressed in the reciprocal,
in the adjusted model, swimmers with lower numeric PSSI
scores had increased odds of injury (adjusted OR ¼8.80
[95% CI ¼1.21, 63.71]).Table 1. Participant Characteristics

DISCUSSION
The purpose of our study was to determine the extent to
which prior injury, poor movement competency, erroneousfreestyle technique, and low PSSI score were associated
with noncontact musculoskeletal injury in collegiate
swimmers. Compared with epidemiologic data on colle-giate swimmers, the injuries recorded (to the shoulder, backor sacroiliac joint, and knee) align with national estimates
of the most frequently injured body regions.
3,4Our
hypothesis regarding the risk factors for these injurieswas partially supported. Swimmers with a previous injuryhad almost 9-times higher odds of an injury. Although the
total scores on the MSST14, FSTA, and PSSI were not
associated with injury, swimmers who exhibited a cross-over hand position during the hand-entry phase of thefreestyle stroke had 8.5-times higher odds of injury. In
addition, after adjusting for earlier injury, we noted that a
lower perceived percentage chance of injury was associatedwith increased odds of injury.
Injury History
Our observation that previous injury was a risk factor for
injury conﬁrms the results of 2 prior prospective studies:
one in Division I collegiate swimmers and the other in club
swimmers.2,7This ﬁnding has both simple and complex
ramiﬁcations. Identifying athletes with an earlier injury is
straightforward. In this study, we used a comprehensive
injury history questionnaire. For collegiate swimmers,preseason meetings with student-athletes or injury-surveil-lance records (where comprehensive) could also provide
this information. The challenge lies in determining how to
manage swimmers with previous injuries. For example,coaches and sports medicine teams can ensure fullrehabilitation of those injuries,
33,34prescribe targeted
prevention exercises for the swimmers,5and closely
monitor training and competition workloads.22Movement System Screening Tool
Poor movement competency based on the MSST14 was
not a risk factor for injury. In a cross-sectional study of the
MSST16, researchers26determined that 40 athletes with
nontraumatic shoulder injuries scored a mean 6SE of 5.8 6
1.2 points lower on the MSST16 than 40 matched pairs.However, using that cross-sectional design, it was notpossible to identify whether the observed deﬁcits were acause or result of the injuries. In addition, although the cross-sectional study sample involved 8 swimmers, it also includedathletes from .12 other sports.
26Unlike their land-based
counterparts, swimmers perform most of their trainingimmersed in water, in a non–weight-bearing horizontal bodyposition, and rely on their upper extremities for propulsion.In this aquatic environment, swimmers undergo uniquebiomechanical, physiological, and perceptual demands.From a speciﬁcity standpoint, movement competency onland may contribute little to the injury risk in swimmers.
As related to the shoulder, the authors of prospective
studies of swimmers demonstrated relationships betweeninjury and limited extension ROM
10and strength,8external-
rotation ROM7and strength ratio (with respect to internal
rotation),11and horizontal abduction ROM9and endur-
ance.12Conversely, we found no associations between
injury and any of the shoulder-related MSST componenttests (shoulder mobility, glenohumeral internal-rotationdeﬁcit, scapular dyskinesis, and the closed chain upperextremity stability test).
26These conﬂicting results could
reﬂect differences in the tests as well as the ages of studyparticipants. All of the earlier studies included swimmersyounger than college age.
Freestyle Swimming Technique Assessment
Although movement competency on land was not a risk
factor for injury, 1 error in freestyle stroke technique didincrease the odds of injury, namely, a crossover hand entry.The crossover hand entry is similar to the provocation
position in the Neer test for shoulder impingement. Of the
11 swimmers who sustained injuries, 9 exhibited thistechnique error. However, 9 participants swam with acrossover hand entry and did not sustain an injury. Thus,this technique error appears to be more sensitive thanspeciﬁc for predicting injury, which is a desirable propertyfor a screening test. The observed variability in injuryresponse could be because of structural and functionaldifferences in swimmers’ shoulders.
16The morphology of
some swimmers’ shoulders may permit pain-free move-ment through this ROM, whereas for others, the extremerepetition irritates the subacromial structures.
The relationship between a crossover hand entry and
injury in our investigation appears to conﬂict with priorTable 3. Associations Between the Freestyle Swimming

results.12In that research, swimmers who made a hand-
entry error had unexpectedly lower odds of injury (OR ¼
0.37 [95% CI ¼0.16, 0.91]) than swimmers who did not
make the error.12Yet in addition to the crossover hand-
entry position, the authors considered a lateral entryposition to be erroneous.
12In contrast, we did not consider
a lateral entry position erroneous. A lateral entry may be
suboptimal from a performance standpoint. Still, unlike themedial crossover, the lateral entry does not put the shoulderin the provocative end-range position that has beenimplicated in swimmer’s shoulder.
1This difference in
rating systems between studies may account for theconﬂicting ﬁndings. Despite the high prevalence of other
freestyle technique errors, none were associated with injury
in this or the earlier investigation.
12These ﬁndings include
techniques that coaches and researchers have long consid-ered risky, such as a thumb-ﬁrst hand entry and a cross-under pull-through.

entry, regarding injury risk, a variety of freestyle techniques
may be acceptable. Coaches should evaluate technique on
an individual basis relative to each swimmer’s uniquemusculoskeletal proﬁle.
16
Perceived Susceptibility to Sport Injury
We are the ﬁrst to prospectively examine the association
between the numeric PSSI score and injury. After we
adjusted for previous injury, for every 1-point decrease in
PSSI score, the odds of injury increased almost 9-fold. Ourﬁnding aligns with the Health Belief Model, which positsthat if athletes perceive their injury risk to be low, they maybe less likely to engage in injury-prevention activities, whichactually increases their risk.
24The authors of 2 earlier studies
evaluated similar constructs with mixed results. In 1 study,35
youth soccer players with a lower perceived risk of injury
(based on the Perceived Risk of Injury in Sports Scale) hadhigher odds of injury. However, in the other,
36cadet
candidates with a greater self-reported concern for injury(on a 3-point scale) had higher odds of injury. Theheterogeneity of ﬁndings may be attributable to differences
in measurement instruments or populations studied or failure
to control for prior injury, which has been shown to increasethe PSSI score.
24
Limitations and Recommendations for Future
Research
We based injury history and injury over the course of the
season on the reports of student-athletes and coaches, notelectronic medical records. We chose this approach to capture
all episodes of interfering pain, including those that affected
the participants’ ability to train and compete but did not causethem to seek medical attention. Self-report does introduce thepotential for bias, which we mitigated by limiting the injuryhistory to the past 2 years and cross-referencing the injuryreports of coaches and student-athletes.
Additionally, our sample was limited to student-athletes
from 1 men’s and 1 women’s NCAA Division III team and1 season. As such, our results may not be generalizable to
swimmers at other competitive levels or swimmers
pursuing substantially different workloads. Furthermore,this sample size prevented us from assessing the possibleinteraction of risk factors in a multifactorial model. It alsoresulted in wide CIs surrounding the ORs. Therefore,readers should interpret the magnitudes of the observed
associations with caution. Moreover, based on the small
sample size, a type II error may have obscured theassociations between some risk factors and injury. Forexample, our study was underpowered to detect associa-tions with injury for the scapular dyskinesis test (acomponent test of the MSST) and the PSSI preventabilityquestion, which both had ORs of .2.0 (Tables 2 and 4,
respectively). Nevertheless, we detected associations be-
tween crossover hand entry and numeric PSSI score andinjury. These associations represent novel ﬁndings in anunderstudied athlete population.
To reduce the risk of type II error and further improve our
understanding of risk factors for injury in swimmers,additional larger-scale studies on multiple teams or acrossmultiple seasons (or both) are needed. Future interventionstudies are also warranted to assess the effects of (1) tertiaryprevention exercises plus education for swimmers with
previous injuries (to make them more aware of their
increased risk) and (2) modiﬁcation of the crossover hand-entry position in freestyle.
CONCLUSIONS
We reafﬁrmed prior injury as a risk factor for noncontact
musculoskeletal injury in competitive swimmers. We also
identiﬁed another risk factor that heretofore had been
largely theoretical, namely, a crossover hand positionduring the entry phase of the freestyle stroke. Contrary toour hypothesis, no other characteristic of freestyle tech-nique was associated with injury, and neither the MSST14nor any component test thereof was associated with injury.Although limited by a small sample size, given the lack of
association between the MSST14 total and component test
scores and injury, our data do not support using theMSST14 to appraise swimmers’ injury risk. Finally, afterwe adjusted for previous injury, a low numeric PSSI scorewas a risk factor for injury. Coaches and sports medicinepractitioners should focus on gathering thorough injuryhistories on their swimmers. Swimmers with earlier injuries
may beneﬁt from tertiary prevention exercises as well as
education on prior injury as a risk factor for reinjury or newinjury. Coaches should also continually audit swimmers’freestyle technique for the crossover hand-entry position.To appraise the injury risk comprehensively, coachesshould consider these intrinsic risk factors in conjunction
with extrinsic risk factors, including workloads.
