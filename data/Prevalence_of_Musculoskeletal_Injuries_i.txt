Abstract: An epidemiological survey was conducted to collect data relating to the prevalence and frequency of 
musculoskeletal injuries in Zimbabwean high school male and female swimmers. A questionnaire was admin istered on site 
thus ensuring that the response rate was 100 percen t. Analysis of results revealed that of the 45 resp ondents there were 22 male 
(48.9%) and 23 female subjects (51.1%). A total of 27 swimmers (60% hence 16 male; 11 females); 59.26%  and 40.74% 
respectively reported that they had musculoskeletal  problems and pain mainly shoulder problems (males = 62% and females = 
57.1%), followed by knee injuries (males = 20.6% an d females = 16.7%), and low back pain region (males  = 17.1% and 
females = 26.2%). There was a statistical significa nce in injury difference between male and female hi gh school swimmers (t= 
2.46, p= 0.031). Considering the difference of inju ries with respect to strokes significant injuries d ifference were found in Back 
Strokes (p= 0.034) and Butterfly (p= 0.018). Howeve r, no significant difference were found in Breast S troke (p= 0.567) and 
Crawl (p= 0.852). Musculoskeletal injuries are comm on in high school male and female swimmers. Correct  stroke technique 
and stroke alterations may help to prevent injuries  and care must be taken for their prevention and ea rly safe return to play.

1. Introduction 
Swimming is an all ages unique sport which presents  
prophylactic and therapeutic value, with low risk o f trauma 
stirring in an impact-free environment [1, 2]. Swim ming can 
be recreational, rehabilitation or a highly competi tive sport 
which require high levels of training and performan ce, which 
can cause overuse on muscular skeletal system, caus ing 
injuries to swimmers. It requires a variety of phys ical 
attributes, stroke specific skills and combines bot h upper and 
lower extremity strength exercises with cardiovascu lar 
training [3-5, 13]. Freestyle, butterfly, backstrok e, and 
breaststroke are the four strokes for competitive s wimming. 
Regardless of the stroke performed during training or 
competition, participants are exposed to constant a nd intense 
stress, with highly repetitive motion that occurs i n the normal swimming stroke which can cause pain or musculoskel etal 
injuries of the upper limb and lower limb [1, 5, 10 , 26], hence 
decreasing sports performance and leading to early dropout. 
Coaches play an imperative role in recognising the early 
indicators of injury. Despite coaches’ early interv ention, 
constant and intense stress syndromes can be best p revented 
by appropriate and modified training programs; stre ngth 
training, flexibility exercises, and altering strok e mechanics 
and technique. 
Despite that the prevalence of musculoskeletal injur ies in 
competitive swimmers has been described in the late  20th 
century and identified more frequency in the should er, with 
37% out of the total, followed by the knee, with 28 %, and the 
foot and ankle, both with 19% [6]. The author repor ted that 
musculoskeletal injuries in high school swimmers may  be of 
trauma or secondary origin, by overtraining. Acute trauma

injuries are rare and injuries by overtraining predo minately 
occur in competitive athletes.  Researchers still show that there 
is limited information which exists regarding the e pidemiology 
of swimming injury patterns at the high school, coll egiate, 
elite, amateur, and master’s levels [2, 5, 7-10, 13 , 28]. 
In Midlands province, Zimbabwe’s central province l acks 
studies on the prevalence of injuries in swimmers a nd 
information regarding the epidemiology of musculosk eletal 
injury, for competitive swimming. Therefore, the pu rpose of 
the current study was to determine and analyze the pattern of 
injuries in competitive, Midlands, male and female high 
school swimmers over the course of 3 years.  
2. Methodology 
2.1. Sample Size and Sampling 
From a total of 105 swimmers in the Midlands provin ce, 
only 45 swimmers (22 boys and 23 girls) purposively  
recruited. Both boys and girls had mean age was 16. 43± 2.36 
years, weight of 55.01 ± 6.14 kg, height 168.34 ± 9 .81 cm. 
BMI for boys was 19.31±1.22 whilst girls had 20.05 ±1.73. 
Average training age was 3.41±1.52 years and traini ng 
duration was 3.08 ± 1.69 hours. All recruited, were  regular 
competitive swimmers in both provincial and nationa l 
swimming championships during the period of 2013-20 15. 
This was a cross-sectional study among high school children 
from the three government and two private high scho ols in 
Kwekwe and Gweru districts. 
2.2. Ethical Considerations 
Ethics approval for this study was obtained from th e 
National University of Science and Technology (NUST ) and 
permission to use the schools were obtained from th e 
Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education, Midlan ds 
Province. The nature and scope of the study were ex plained 
to the swimmers and their parents/guardians who gav e 
informed consent before investigation was conducted . 
Informed consent was obtained from each of the stud y 
participants and their parents or guardians, swimmi ng 
coaches, team medics and school heads. Only swimmer s with 
both written assent and consent were used as subjec ts in this 
study. The investigator personally contacted the he ads of 
schools, team managers and coaches of the various h igh 
school and club teams to explain the purpose of thi s study. 
2.3. Data Collection 
A questionnaire prepared by Venancio B. O (2012) [5 ] for 
swimmers was adopted and modified by the investigat or was 
given to the subjects for completion. The questionn aire had 
items covering both biological and training age, 
anthropometry, training type and volume, evaluation  of the 
prevalence of the pain sites, possible injuries as well as sport 
injuries treatment and rehabilitation. Two research  assistants, 
who were final-year students in the National Univer sity of 
Science and Technology (NUST), Sports Science and 
Coaching Department and had covered Biokinetics mod ule participated in the data collection. 
2.4. Data Analysis 
Data was analysed using descriptive statistics. The  
Statistical Package for the Social Sciences, versio n 20.0 
(SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA) was used. The 
parametric t-test was applied to test significance level at p < 
0.05 for male and female swimmers frequencies. P-value < 
0.05 was regarded as significant. 
3. Results 
Of these 45 swimmers, 27 swimmers (16 male; 11 
females); 59.26% and 40.74% respectively reported 
musculoskeletal problems and pain in the shoulder, knee, or 
lower back region.

Male 16 1.46± 0.34   
*Significant correlations are flagged at P < 0.05 
The obtained t=2.46 was significant at.001 level, 
indicating that male swimmers had greater incidence  of 
musculoskeletal problems and pain/injuries than the ir female 
counterparts. 
The most complaints of musculoskeletal problems and  
pain/injuries were found related to pool training c ompared to 
dry land, cross and weight training; 72% and 28% 
respectively. More frequently musculoskeletal pain/ injury 
problems were found to freestyle swimmers (59.6%) 
compared to other strokes during both training and 
competition. Statistical information of incidence o f injuries 
recorded in the high school male and female swimmer s 
during competition and training periods showed that  there 
was no significant difference in the occurrence of injuries in 
relation to both the competition and the training p eriod.

Results on the table above shows that injuries diff erences 
between male and female high school swimmers were f ound 
significant with respect to Butterfly (t=6.01) and Back Stroke 
(t=5.22), while Crawl (t=2.13) and Breast Stroke (t =2.01) 
were not significant. 
The most common musculoskeletal complaint was 
shoulder pain (16 out of 27 swimmers, 59.2%), follo wed by

knee pain (7 out of 27 swimmers, 25.9%), and low ba ck pain 
(4 out of 27 swimmers, 14.8%). There was no statist ical 
difference between high school male and female swim mers 
regarding the incidence of different types of muscu loskeletal 
problems (p>0.05).

and female swimmers (Take from excel attachment). 
4. Discussion 
Results of the current study revealed that there wa s no 
statically significant difference in the number of injuries 
when comparing high school male and female swimmers  (p < 
0.05) [5, 10, 12]. Transition to a new level of swi mming 
make swimmers to be at an increased risk for injury , however 
a gradual decrease in the percentage of injuries in  the later 
years of competition was observed in both gender [1 0, 12]. 
Most incidences of musculoskeletal pain/injury comp laints 
occurred were reported during the training sessions  than the 
competition period [2, 3, 5, 10, 11, 26]. This stud y’s results 
showed that upper extremities were the most frequen tly 
reported, with prevalence for female (57.1%) and ma le 
(62.3%) swimmers and stress on the shoulder with te ndinitis 
and bursitis [3, 5, 13, 28]. These results are in t he range 
found by other researchers previously ranging from 3-67% 
[10, 12]. Whilst missing training or competition re sult may 
result in shoulder pain/injury [14, 15, 22]  an analysis of 
shoulder pain by other researchers concluded that t hese were 
multifactorial; stroke biomechanics, overuse and fa tigue of 
the shoulder muscles, scapula, and upper back and 
glenohumeral laxity with subsequent shoulder instab ility [2, 
3, 5, 8, 10, 13, 16-18, 26-28].  
Knee injury was the second reported source of pain.  This 
was in line with literature which has ranked knee p ain/injury 
second to shoulder pain as a common complaint in 
competitive swimmers [1, 10, 15, 19]. Some authorit ies have 
a different notion that knee problems were identifi ed third 
after spine pain/injuries [10, 12, 14] and other up per 
extremity injuries as they are associated mainly wi th in pool 
or cross training activities [10, 14]. However, the  
biomechanics of the breaststroke style is different  from the 
other strokes [15, 19-21], in that the upper extrem ities 
activity is highlighted which simultaneously start leg stroke 
with maximal flexion of hip and knee articulations,  ankle dorsiflexion, ending with extension and adduction o f the 
mentioned joints [15, 21]. Therefore, there is recr uiting of 
many muscular groups combined with the movements’ 
repetition leading to overload of the musculoskelet al system 
generating pain episodes. Increased varus and valgu s loads 
also occur in the knee in addition to rapid knee ex tension [5]. 
Knee pain/injuries are a result of repetitive hydro dynamic 
forces result in cumulative stresses that increase the risk of 
soft tissue injuries [10]. These hydrodynamic repet itive 
forces of the breaststroke kick places increased st ress on the 
medial structures of the knee; collateral ligament,  patellar 
facet and synovial lining of the knee joint [1, 10,  11, 15, 19-
21]. 
Spine/lower back was the third reported source of 
pain/injury in this study. The use of training devi ces such as 
fins, kick boards, or pull buoys increase the risk and 
development of low back pain in competitive swimmer s [6, 
23, 24]. High intensity and repetitiveness of swimm ing 
strokes load the posterior structures of the lumbar  spine, 
resulting in spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis [1 , 2, 3]. 
Muscle strength, endurance, and flexibility protect  against 
low back pain and/or injuries [6, 14, 15]. In the p ool, the 
dolphin kick, utilized for the breast stroke and bu tterfly 
stroke, places greater stress on the low back due t o the 
extension stresses on the lumbar spine hence mainta ining 
hyperextension of the lower back to achieve a strea mlined 
position [12, 24, 26, 27]. Therefore, mechanical lo ading of 
the spine in competitive sports results in lumbar 
intervertebral disk degeneration [4, 8, 24, 25, 26] . 
Limitations 
a) Our study used a relatively small sample 
b) There may be recall bias when using a questionnaire  to 
injuries sustained during swimming season, since 
participants can forget to record when the injury 
occurred 
c) Sports injuries usually are characterized by a 
multifactorial causes, maybe the questions included  in 
the current study’s questionnaire were not sufficie nt to 
detect possible differences between swimmers with p ain 
and without pain [26]. 
5. Conclusion 
The current study showed prevalence of musculoskele tal 
Injuries in males and females practicing swimming f rom 
Higher School of Zimbabwe. Most injuries reported i nvolved 
the shoulder, the knee and axial spine. Female swim mers 
were more prone to suffer an overuse injury than th eir male 
swimmer counterparts. Musculoskeletal injuries are a 
common source of pain in competitive swimmers in-po ol 
training, but mostly cross-training also contribute s 
significantly. To minimise pain/injury in swimming,  correct 
stroke technique and stroke alterations need to be practiced 
and emphasized. Also, much care should be taken for  their 
prevention and early safe return to play.

Recommendations 
There is need to carry longitudinal studies to conf irm 
similar results with swim teams regionally, followe d over 
several competitive seasons to ensure stability of data and 
generalisation of findings.
