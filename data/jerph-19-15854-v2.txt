Abstract: Background: An athlete’s menstrual cycle may be seriously disturbed when she undertakes
a physical activity that exceeds the body’s adaptive capacity and/or applies dietary restrictions. The
main aim of this study was to assess the impact of swimming training undertaken by participants of
sport clubs on disorders of the menstrual cycle. Methods: The study involved 64 female athletes. The
questionnaire utilized in this study was composed by the authors, however some of the questions
were based on Low Energy Availability in Females Questionnaire (LEAF-Q). Results: 31.26% of
swimmers reported that the menstrual cycle was stopped for more than 3 months, of which 21.88%
had a menstrual absence for more than 6 months and 9.38% between 3 months and 6 months. Years
of training were a positive predictor of the ‘more profuse bleeding’. There was a negative correlation
between the disorders of the menstrual cycle, the body weight of the female participants ( p <0.05)
and the body mass index ( p <0.01). It was found that with the severity of the degree of disorder
in the menstrual cycle, the number of injuries among the surveyed swimmers increased ( p <0.05).
Conclusions: The correct body weight of the participants was a positive predictor of the absence of
the menstrual cycle disorders among the majority of women practicing swimming. Disorders in the
menstrual cycle occurring in a certain percentage of the swimmers positively correlated with the
number of injuries recorded among these swimmers. Swimming has been shown to alleviate some of
the premenstrual symptoms.

1. Introduction
Swimming is one of the most popular sports in the world and the second largest sport
at the Olympics based on the number of athletes competing in pool events. In 2012, the
Olympic Games were watched by over 219 million people, and swimming was one of the
most often watched sports competitions. The discussed sport discipline is based on the
ability to move the body in water in a harmonious and coordinated way by performing
speciﬁc movements of the upper and lower limbs [ 1–3]. Swimming is unique because it
takes place in an aquatic environment and it requires multiple abilities, from reaction speed
to proper joint and, what is more, in this physical activity there is a necessity for more
energy than in sports performed in a terrestrial environment, due to the need to overcome
the hydrodynamic water resistance [4,5].
The discussed physical activity can be done in a variety of styles and distances,
including conﬁned water (swimming pools) or open water (seas, lakes) [ 4]. Depending

on the position of the body in water, the nature of the propulsion movements of both the
lower and upper limbs, the following swimming techniques are distinguished: breaststroke,
backstroke, freestyle (crawl), butterﬂy style and a combination of the above techniques
in alternating style competitions. In swimming competitions, participants usually swim
from 50 m to 200 m, individual medley is held over 200 m and 400 m, while in open water
swimming, the champions most often compete at distances of 3 km. Swimming, in addition
to the individual discipline, is also part of multisport races, such as triathlons, and there
swimming distances depend on the type of triathlon and can total, for instance, 1.5 km,
1.9 km, or 3.8 km in Ironmen competitions. In contrast, at the Olympics swimming typically
ranges from 50 m to 1.5 km and lasts from less than 20 s to more than 15 min [5].
Women’s participation in swimming competitions, as in all other sport disciplines, has
become commonplace. Among young women undertaking training at the professional level,
the commonly used training programs are based on frequent and long training sessions,
which can have a real impact on disorders of the menstrual cycle, one of the most important
physiological processes in a woman’s organism [ 6–8]. A menstrual cycle within norm is a
clear indication of a woman’s health, fertility and reproductive ability. Most physiological
processes in the female reproductive system involve complex interactions between various
tissues, hormones, and organs, including the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, ovaries, and
uterus [ 9]. Unfortunately, even a normal menstrual cycle can be seriously disturbed if a
woman undertakes physical activity that exceeds the body’s adaptive capacity and/or
applies dietary restrictions [10].
Eating disorders, menstrual disorders and decreased bone mineral density (BMD)—
which often leads to injuries, are the three components of the syndrome called Female
Athlete Triad—FAT, to which women who are involved in sports that require a slim body
are particularly vulnerable [ 6–8,11,12]. Therefore, female swimmers, similarly to gymnasts,
skaters, and dancers, may be at risk of occurring FAT because these sports activities are
characterized by performance in skimpy outﬁts and a desire to have a slim body shape
and sometimes unrealistically low body weight [ 13–15]. However, by contrast to the above
information, attention should be paid to the fact that there exist many theories trying to
explain why female swimmers appear to be relatively protected against the development
of menstrual disorders and the triad, compared to other female sportswomen [16].
However, FAT syndrome and its components described above constitute only a small
part of the complex of symptoms associated with low energy availability (LEA) much more
widely discussed in the academic literature, called Relative Energy Deﬁciency in Sport
(RED-S) [ 17–19]. Both RED-S and FAT are a consequence of dietary restrictions, including
both those undertaken consciously and those resulting from the lack of knowledge about
the adequate supply of calories during physical activity and sports training [11,12,17–19] .
RED-S is a set of symptoms occurring when the amount of energy consumed with food
is insufﬁcient in relation to the current needs of the organism. Insufﬁcient energy intake
disturbs the organism homeostasis and this effect can be exacerbated when a person
engages in a physical activity at the level of regular sports training. LEA leads to many
very serious, negative health effects affecting all organisms systems, including the female
reproductive system [ 20–23]. In order to maintain proper functions of the organism, the
exercising woman should maintain the energy consumption at the level of 45 kcal/kg
fat-free mass/day, as providing energy below 30 kcal/kg fat-free mass/day inhibits, e.g.,
reproductive functions [ 12]. It is necessary to pay special attention to the fact, that the
amount of calories supplied to the athlete’s body during strenuous sports training should
be high enough to prevent RED-S and FAT. Overall, estimates show that up to 50% of
exercising women have gentle menstrual disorders, and 33% have no menstrual bleeding
at all [ 13]. The negative energy balance present in the organism is unable to support
and maintain its important functions, including: homeostasis, growth, reproduction and,
therefore, neuroendocrine systems adapt to negative conditions by “switching the body”
to the functions that are the most signiﬁcant at a given moment, thus the survival of
the organism. It creates a situation where the right amount of energy is not supplied
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022 ,19, 15854 3 of 17
to these tissues and organs that are not directly related to the survival of the organism.
The mechanisms of the “energy saving mode” come from the evolutionary legacy aimed
at securing the survival and function of those tissues of the body that are necessary to
maintain life in times of hunger [ 20–23]. Interestingly, as a result of these adaptations,
the energy balance and consequently body weight may remain at a certain “task point”
representing an apparent state of homeostasis that masks the actual lack of energy available
for optimal physiological functions [20–23].
The relationship between menstrual disorders and sports injuries is apparent [ 24–27].
A study Mallinson et al. [ 25] found that female athletes who have one triad component
have a risk of developing stress fractures about three times higher than athletes without
triad components. For women with two or three components of triad, the risk of stress
fractures is up to ﬁve times higher than for athletes without them. Studies [ 25–27] have
also shown that the greater the number of triad symptoms, the greater the risk of injuries
associated with bone stress and low BMD.
Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a set of physical, behavioral, and psychological symp-
toms that occur among most women of childbearing age. Symptoms appear in the late
luteal phase of the menstrual cycle and disappear about 2–4 days after the onset of bleed-
ing [ 28]. Numerous international institutions and societies recommend aerobic training as
an aid in relieving PMS symptoms, these include among others: The American College of
Sports Medicine (ACSM), The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists [ 29] the
Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG), and the International Society
for Premenstrual Disorders (ISPMD) [ 30]. Recommendations are mainly related to the fact
that water reduces the gravitational pressure on the joints and muscles. The pressure of
water improves venous return. It was found that nerves present in human skin react to
the surrounding water environment by transferring information to deeper parts of the
body, thus stimulating the immune system, regulating the secretion of stress hormones,
improving blood circulation, decreasing pain sensitivity, improving brain circulation and
impact on the hypothlamo-pituitary-adrenal axis. Water massage also soothes the nervous
system, contributing to the feeling of relaxation [31].
In relation to the information presented above, the aim of this study was to assess the
impact of swimming training undertaken by participants of sport clubs on disorders of the
menstrual cycle. The study also determined whether menstrual cycle disorders occurring
in female swimmers overlap with the occurrence of sports injuries. In addition, using the
opportunity to study a group of swimming athletes, the impact of swimming training on
the occurrence and the possible alleviation of the premenstrual symptoms associated with
sport were assessed.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Participants
The study initially involved 96 adolescent female athletes, regularly practicing swim-
ming. Subsequently, 32 women, who used contraceptives or any medications that could
affect the woman’s menstrual cycle, were excluded from this group. Therefore, the ﬁnal
statistical analysis included 64 female athletes meeting the inclusion criteria for the study.
The mean age of the swimmers included in the analysis was 24.69 standard deviation
2.15 years. The average body weight of the competitors was 64.16 9.39 kg, height
171.885.82 cm, and the body mass index (BMI) was 21.67 2.62. Women represented
sports clubs located in the city of Krakow. The criteria for inclusion in the study were the
occurrence of menarche and undertaking swimming training at the professional level. The
criteria for exclusion from the study were the use of hormonal contraception, declaration
of amenorrhea resulting from other known factors not related to physical activity, e.g.,
pregnancy, polycystic ovary syndrome, hysterectomy. The lack of a correctly completed
questionnaire also resulted in exclusion from the research.
Women trained on average from 11.69 3.69 years. The duration of a single training
session was 1.720.37 h, and the number of training sessions per week was 6, which
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022 ,19, 15854 4 of 17
translated into an average of 12.77 6.66 h of training per week. The main swimming style
undertaken by the swimmers was the crawl, where 54.69% of women trained it, followed
by breaststroke style (29.69%) and backstroke (15.63%). Most women, which is 43.75%,
swam 5 to 7 km during a single training session, 39.06% of the female competitors swam 3
to 5 km, 14.06%—less than 3 km, and only two swimmers covered a distance of more than
7 km during one training session.
2.2. Questionnaire
The questionnaire utilized in this study was composed by the authors, however, in
order to ask swimmers precise and properly formulated questions regarding the issues
of this research and in order to receive answers that would be the most valuable and
authoritative, part of the questions were based on a validated tool that assesses early
symptoms related to energy deﬁciency in women related to FAT and RED-S, namely Low
Energy Availability in Females Questionnaire (LEAF -Q). The questions about premenstrual
symptoms have been added. Additionally, Rate of Perceived Exertion scale (RPE scale) was
used for the study [ 32]. This tool was employed because it seemed interesting to compare
the subjective assessment of the intensity level and the general perception of physical effort
undertaken by the swimmers during training, in relation to the studied variables. The
scale presented to the participants ranged from 6 to 20, where 6 meant “no effort at all”
and 20 “maximal effort”. The swimmers were asked to choose a numerical value that best
described the level of physical exertion experienced by the athlete during training. The
sportswoman was asked to consider all subjective impressions and sensations regarding
both physical stress and fatigue. The Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) was used to determine
the subjective assessment of pain intensity experienced during menstrual bleeding, where
0 means no pain and 10 means unbearable pain.
2.3. Statistical Analyses
Statistical analyses were performed for the three statistical tests applied: chi-square,
Spearman correlations, and logistic regression, using the SPSS 27 software program (Ver-
sion 27.0, IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). They were performed by means of G*Power
software [ 33,34]. The achieved power in the case of the chi-square test, for small, medium,
and large effects (phi = 0.1; 0.3, 0.5), respectively, was: 13%, 67%, and 98%. For Spearman
correlations (rho = 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5; two-tailed tests): 12%, 70%, and 99%. For logistic
regression (odds ratios 1.3, 3.0, and 5.0; proportion of participants on dependent variable
was assumed as 0.2): 7%, 49%, and 83%. The achieved power was satisfactory in the case of
large effects, but not medium or small ones.
3. Results
The athletes declared that the level of subjectively perceived physical effort related to
the undertaken physical activity, i.e., swimming training, measured on the RPE scale, was
15.302.16. Statistical analysis showed no signiﬁcance between subjectively perceived
physical exertion and disorders of the menstrual cycle, age of menarche appearance and
pain experienced during menstrual bleeding. Studies have shown that all swimmers had
their ﬁrst menstrual period naturally. Among the vast majority of the women (70.31%),
menarche appeared between the ages of 12 and 14, in 18.75% at or below the age of 11, and
among 10.94%, only at the age of 15 or later. On average, the menarche among the female
participants was 12.63 1.50 years of age.
Disorders of the menstrual cycle, understood as the lack of menstrual bleeding, which
did not occur after a period of regular bleeding, never occurred among 31.25% of the
swimmers. To the question: “ are your periods regular ?” (Every 28th to 34th day) the majority
of swimmers (70.31%) replied “ Yes, most of the time ”. However, when asked “ Have your
periods ever stopped for 3 consecutive months or longer (besides pregnancy) ?” a total of 31.26%
of the swimmers answered “ yes”, of which 21.88% experienced a menstrual absence for
more than 6 months, and 9.38% between 3 and 6 months. No bleeding lasting less than
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022 ,19, 15854 5 of 17
3 months was reported among 37.50% of female athletes. There was a negative correla-
tion between the disorders of the menstrual cycle, the body weight of the female athletes
(p <0.05) and the body mass index ( p <0.01). The higher the body weight of the athletes
and the higher the BMI, the less frequent the menstrual cycle disorders among the swim-
mers. There was also a negative correlation between the athlete’s age and disorders of the
menstrual cycle, but it was not statistically signiﬁcant. What is more, a negative correlation
was also established between the number of years of swimming training and the number
of trainings per week, and the disorders in the menstrual cycle. However, this correlation
did not show statistical signiﬁcance (Table 1).

Women with menstrual disorders were asked to give a probable, subjectively consid-
ered reason for the situation. A signiﬁcant percentage of swimmers (75.00%) indicated
that too high intensity of the undertaken swimming training was the possible cause of the
menstrual cycle disruption. Respectively, 20.45% of the women admitted to taking dietary
restrictions and reducing body weight, while 2.27% of the participants indicated lack of
sleep and dehydration.
By analyzing the swimming styles undertaken by the women and their possible impact
on disorders of the menstrual cycle, statistical signiﬁcance was found for disorders of the
menstruation lasting less than 3 months and the swimming style undertaken, including the
backstroke (Table 2).

In order to obtain information on the possible impact of swimming training on the alle-
viation of pain associated with menstrual bleeding, the athletes were asked at the beginning
whether they felt pain related to menstruation. The vast majority of swimmers (79.69%)
answered “yes, but only at the beginning of bleeding“, subsequently, 18.75% declared that
the menstruation was painful throughout the entire duration of the menstruation period,
and only one woman (1.56%) said that she did not feel any pain during menstrual bleeding.
Another question concerned the opinion on the effect of swimming training undertaken
during menstruation on the increase or decrease in pain associated with menstrual period.
The participants were asked to mark the answer that best corresponded to the sub-
jective experiences of the women. About half of the swimmers (52.38%) stated that their
regular training reduces pain, 30.16% of the swimmers do not feel any inﬂuence of swim-
ming training on any changes in pain feeling, and 11.11% believe that swimming training
increases the pain accompanying menstruation. Four women, which accounted for only
6.35%, do not undertake training during menstruation. On the other hand, when analyzing
the impact of swimming training undertaken during menstrual bleeding on the possible
reduction of the pain level occurring and assessed by the respondents, appearing both at
the beginning of menstrual bleeding and throughout its duration, no statistical correlation
was found.
The swimmers were then asked to rate the overall level of pain they experienced
during the menstrual bleeding on the NRS scale. The most female athletes (21.88%) declared
that the pain they feel during menstruation corresponds to the number 8, successively:
17.19% indicated the number 9, 14.06% the number 5, 12.50% the number 7, and 10.94% the
number 6. The numbers 2, 3, 4 were, respectively indicated by 7.81%, 4.69% and 6.25% of the
women. No pain and pain at the level of 1 and 10 were indicated only by individual persons,
which was only 1.56%. Subsequently, the swimmers indicated numbers that express the
level of pain experienced when they undertake training during the period of menstrual
bleeding. It was noted, that the numerical values for the level of pain experienced during
swimming training in the period of menstrual bleeding changed, compared to the pain
present without training. In particular, the differences concerned the numbers describing
the intensity of pain at higher levels, i.e., above the number 5. For example, without taking
up sports training, the number 8, which means relatively intensive pain, was indicated by
21.88% of women, while the same number was indicated by only 6.25% of female swimmers
during menstrual bleeding. Number 9 also decreased from 17.19% without training to
9.38% during menstruation and training. The percentage of women choosing the number 7
was 9.38% with training vs. 12.50% without training. However, it is surprising to notice
and record an increase in the percentage of women declaring the level of pain described by
the number 6 from 10.94% without training to 17.19% during training, a clear increase was
also noted for the number 3 from 4.69% without training to 15.63% during training and
for the number 0 from 1.56% without training up to 6.25% during training. There were no
noticeable differences for the remaining numbers on the NRS scale. Analyzing the impact of
swimming training undertaken during menstrual bleeding on the possible reduction of the
pain perception level present and assessed with a numerical scale by the participants in the
study, a positive correlation of rho = 0.68 ( p <0.05) was found between the pain experienced
by women during menstrual bleeding and the pain experienced during training at the time
of menstruation.

Changes in the monthly cycle, e.g., its shortening or prolongation, can be caused by,
e.g., changing the intensity of training. Therefore, the athletes were asked whether they felt
changes in the characteristics of the monthly cycle with the increase in intensity, frequency
or duration of training. The majority of women (65.63%) stated that their swimming
training inﬂuences changes in the monthly cycle. Among the above-mentioned women, the
most (38.10%) reported that bleeding lasts less days, i.e., it has been shorter, successively
35.71% said that the menstrual bleeding is more extensive, 21.43% said that the bleeding is
less heavy, and 4.76% said that the bleeding lasts more days.
Correlation analysis showed, that with the increase in the number of years of swim-
ming training among the female athletes, the frequency of heavy monthly bleeding in-
creased ( p <0.05). There was also a negative correlation between the athlete’s age and the
duration of monthly bleeding. The older the swimmer was, the less frequently the bleeding
lasted for more days than the generally accepted norm of normal bleeding ( p <0.05). There
was also a statistically signiﬁcant relationship ( p <0.05) between BMI and reduction of
heavy periods. The correlation was negative, which meant that the higher the BMI of a
given athlete, the less frequent scanty bleeding (Table 4). Statistical analysis conﬁrmed
the signiﬁcance that occurs between the change in training, which may be, for example,
an increase in the intensity, or the frequency or duration of training, and the symptoms
observed by the athletes regarding the monthly cycle. Bleeding was more profuse with
rho = 0.40 ( p <0.01), or lasted less days with rho = 0.44 ( p <0.01). A change in training
also led to scanty bleeding rho = 0.29 ( p <0.05), or amenorrhea (lack of the menstruation)
rho = 0.31 ( p <0.05). Changes in training did not signiﬁcantly correlate only with the
possible extension of the monthly cycle among the surveyed swimmers.

Symptoms of premenstrual syndrome can be alleviated by taking up physical activity,
therefore the most important symptoms characterizing this syndrome were referred to
in the questions asked swimmers. Most of the surveyed women (89.06%) experienced
PMS symptoms. Among the most common symptoms reported by female athletes were:
pain in the lower abdomen, such a response was provided by 13.90% of the athletes, ir-
ritability (13.37%), pain in the lumbosacral region (10.70%), water retention in the body
(10.16%), tearfulness/depression (9.89%), breast hypersensitivity (8.56%), fatigue (8.29%),
diarrhea (6.69%), skin lesions (5.88%), headache/dizziness (5.08%), nausea/vomiting
(4.81%), arthralgia (2.67%). Subsequently, the participants were asked to indicate the
symptoms of PMS that, according to them, are alleviated by undertaking physical activity
such as swimming training. The majority of women stated that swimming reduced lower
abdominal pain (23.44%) and irritability (29.69%), successively swimmers indicated relief
of pain in the lumbosacral region, such an answer was provided by 18.75% of participants,
reduced tearfulness and depression—8.59%, oedema reduction (6.25%) and fatigue reduc-
tion (4.69% of swimmers). A positive effect on the reduction of pain and dizziness was
indicated by 3.91% of the swimmers, only individual persons indicated reduction of other
PMS symptoms. Statistical analysis showed a negative correlation of p< 0.05 between the
number of years of swimming training and the sum of PMS symptoms alleviated by this
type of physical activity.
Injuries in sport are inevitable, but they can be aggravated by disorders in the men-
strual cycle, therefore the research also addressed the issue of injuries suffered by swimmers
occurring during the last year. Although the injuries and the area of their occurrence re-
ported by swimmers are listed below, as these were the data that were collected during
the research, they were not subjected to extensive analysis, because describing injuries
in swimming would signiﬁcantly exceed the capacity of this manuscript. The athletes
were asked two questions, which were formulated as presented in the LEAF questionnaire:
“Have you had absences from your training, or participation in competitions during the last
year due to injuries?”, “If yes, for how many days absence from training or participation
in competition due to injuries have you had in the last year?” The vast majority of female
athletes (79.69%) reported an injury in the last year while taking up their sports career. The
number of injuries among the above-mentioned athletes was different: the most female
swimmers (76.00%) had an injury once or twice in the last year. The occurrence of three or
four injuries in the last year was observed by fewer women, that is only 22.00%, and ﬁve
or more injuries by only one woman, which constitutes 2.00%. The most common injury
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022 ,19, 15854 10 of 17
among the swimmers was joint inﬂammation, such an answer was provided by 31.58%
of the respondents, followed by muscle strain (27.37%), muscle tear or strain (15.79%),
contusion (12.63%), meniscus tears (7.37%) and desmorrhexis or ligament rupture (5.26%).
The participants were also asked which area of the body was the most common part of
injury and 36.56% of women replied that it was the shoulder girdle, 27.96% indicated the
knee joint, 6.45% the ankle joint and the area of the head and neck, 5.38% indicated the
hip joint and muscles of the lower limbs and 4.30% the elbow joint, the remaining single
persons indicated other areas of the body. Most often, the injuries occurred during the
training sessions- such an answer was given by 62.75% of the participants, the main reason
was training overload occurring in 33.33% of women, the least frequent injury occurred as a
result of an accident in the swimming pool, such a situation occurred in 3.92% of swimmers.
A break in training caused by an injury among the largest percentage of athletes, that is
in 41.18% of women, lasted from 1 to 7 days, in 29.41% of swimmers from 8 to 14 days, in
23.53% of women 22 days and longer. Convalescence among 5.88% of swimmers lasted
from 15 to 21 days. A positive correlation was demonstrated between the height, body
weight and the number of years of swimming training and the frequency of injuries among
the female athletes ( p< 0.05) (Table 2). Analyzing the disorders of the menstrual cycle
among the female athletes as compared to the number of injuries, a statistically signiﬁcant
correlation was found: rho = 0.26 ( p< 0.05), showing that the number of injuries increased
with the severity of the menstrual cycle disorder.
Multiple logistic regressions (Table 5) showed that years of training were a positive
predictor of the ‘more profuse bleeding’. No signiﬁcant predictors were detected in the
case of ‘less profuse bleeding’, ‘bleeding lasts less than 3 days’, ‘amenorrhea’, and ‘injuries
incidence’. Analyses were impossible in the case of ‘bleeding lasts more than 3 days’—there
were only two participants with this symptom. Cox and Snell R-squares were comparable
across analyses indicating that the explanative power of the predictors did not differ much
across models.

4. Discussion
Physical activity requires providing sufﬁcient amount of energy to the organism, so
that the competitor’s body can use it not only to maintain its basic functions, but also to
the processes that are related to sport [ 20–23]. In the case of swimming, also to overcome
water resistance and to move in water environment with variable bone-joint-muscular
involvement depending on different swimming styles [ 13]. Despite the many indisputable
advantages of practicing sports, there is a risk of athletes taking dietary restrictions aimed
at achieving low body weight necessary for achieving greater physical efﬁciency and better
results in competitions [ 14]. Although the study did not evaluate eating habits (a diary
of daily energy consumption) of the swimmers, but only menstrual cycle dysfunction as
one of the elements of FAT, the knowledge about the relationship between eating disorders
and low energy availability with disturbances of the menstrual cycle has been repeatedly
demonstrated in the studies of other authors [10–15] and it turns out to be apparent.
The presented research assessed the occurrence of sport-related menstrual cycle disor-
ders in women undertaking long-term swimming training at the competition level. The
ﬁndings of the authors’ own research showed that most of the athletes had menstruation
cycles within norm, which was presumably related to the correct body weight and BMI
within the normal range. Only about 8% of women had a BMI just below the norm. Irregu-
lar menstrual cycles were reported by 29.69% of women, which is a result similar to the
results of the authors assessing menstrual cycle disorders in various groups of non-training
women. For instance, in the study by Aber [ 35] conducted among students of fourth and
ﬁfth classes of curative medicine faculty, that is women of a similar age as the examined
swimmers, it was found that 20.54% had irregular menstrual cycle. Similar results were
obtained by Deborah et al. [ 36], who investigated prevalence of menstrual irregularities in
correlation with body fat among students in India where 23.3% students had menstrual
irregularities. However, secondary amenorrhea observed in the study group of female
swimmers, investigated generally, without analyzing the number of months without men-
strual bleeding, was reported by as many as 68.75% of athletes, which is a signiﬁcant result
compared to the incidence of secondary amenorrhea in the general population who do
not participate in sports, ranges from 2% to 5% [ 8,12]. The results have shown that the
occurrence of secondary amenorrhea in the examined group of swimmers was close to the
upper limit of occurrence of menstrual cycle disorders among athletes, which ranges from
6% to 79% [6,7,11].
The results of this research show that the older the swimmer was, the less frequent
the disorders of the menstrual cycle. The authors of this study also showed that with the
increase in the number of years of swimming training among the athletes, the incidence of
heavy monthly bleeding increased, which was also conﬁrmed by the results of multiple
logistic regressions analysis. Any change in training intensity or frequency resulted in
changes in menstrual bleeding that became more or less heavy, or even stopped completely.
However, it was satisfactory that all the female athletes of the authors’ own research had a
natural menarche, on average around the age of 13, which is a normal phenomenon. For
example, a study Sambanis et al. [ 37] showed that elite artistic swimmers had a menarche
delay of 0.6 years. Beals et al. [ 38] examined the prevalence of disordered eating, menstrual
dysfunction, and low bone mineral density among US collegiate athletes participating
in lean-build and non-lean build sports. It was found that menstrual dysfunction was
signiﬁcantly more prevalent among lean-build athletes.
An interesting study showing results that contradict the above-mentioned research by
Ramsay et al. [ 16] evaluating synchronized swimmers who practice a particular type of
water sport requiring a high level of aerobic and anaerobic ﬁtness combined with grace
and agility. It was found that the elite synchronous swimmers from the UK were not at
risk of developing menstrual disorders and therefore, were unlikely to have triad-related
reduced bone mineral density. However, it is suspected that training (mostly without load)
was not very beneﬁcial for gaining appropriate bone density of these athletes [16].

The introduction to this paper mentions theories that try to explain why female
swimmers may be particularly protected against the development of FAT.First, submerging
the body in cool water may allow swimmers to increase internal body temperature more
than, for example, runners or dancers, which in turn may result in less disruption of the
hypothalamus. Second, swimmers typically have relatively higher levels of body fat than
other athletes. This is not a coincidence, as more body fat allows swimmers to ﬂoat higher,
thereby improving their performance in the sport. Additionally, as mentioned before, a
higher level of adipose tissue protects against disorders of the menstrual cycle [16].
In sport, especially in exercise tests, the Borg rating of perceived exertion scale [ 32]
is a frequently used measure of subjectively perceived physical effort. The level of felt
strain can be an important indicator for coaches and athletes to assess training intensity
and athlete’s endurance. This study showed that the average score of subjective feeling
of physical effort measured with the RPE scale was 15.30 2.16. This result indicates
the fact that for most of the athletes the undertaken swimming exercises were heavy,
however, the percentage of maximum heart rate (86–91% HRmax) and the percentage
of maximum oxygen consumption (76–85% VO2max) in this range are within the zone
of optimal training. Probably, due to the fact that the training was within the optimal
limits—according to the above scale, it did not show a signiﬁcant effect on the dysfunction
of the menstrual cycle.
Despite many unquestionable advantages resulting from taking up physical activity
such as swimming, this sport, when practiced professionally, contributes to contusions
and injuries. The results of our research showed that the most common health problem
reported by female swimmers was shoulder injuries, declared by 36.56% of athletes. In
addition, research has conﬁrmed that with the severity of the degree of disorder in the
menstrual cycle, the number of injuries among the swimmers signiﬁcantly increased, which
is unquestionably related to FAT.
Swimming training is characterized by a relatively large volume, intensity and cyclical
repetition of movement in the shoulder joint. Musculoskeletal overuse injuries, particu-
larly shoulder injuries, nutrition deﬁcits, and overtraining are most commonly observed
among swimmers. A multitude of issues contribute to the “swimmer’s shoulder” from
hypomibility, instability, lack of strength/muscle imbalance, overuse, change in volume,
inadequate recovery to coaching oversigh [ 39–42]. Despite the above facts, injuries in sports,
including swimming, may be reported more often in women who have FAT syndrome,
including estrogen deﬁciency and reduced BMD. This situation occurs despite the fact
that not all three elements of the triad are always present. For instance, in the studies
of Schtscherbyna et al. [ 43] it was found that among 78 elite swimmers aged 11–19, one
component of the triad was present in 47%, while two components were present in a much
smaller proportion of 15.4% and 1.3%. The ﬁndings of the authors’ own research has shown
a strong relationship between the occurrence of menstrual cycle disorders and the incidence
of injuries among the swimmers, which is consistent with the literature describing the triad
syndrome of sportswomen [6–8,12]. The study Mallinson et al. [25] aimed to demonstrate
the relationship between the triad risk assessment score and the number of sports injuries.
In the study group there were 3.4% of sportswomen with LEA and 5.2% of those with
amenorrhea, with none of the athletes having all three elements of the triad or bone mineral
density (BMD). However, among the several groups of athletes examined, swimmers were
found to be at a relatively low risk of injury compared to athletes engaging in other types
of sporting activity.
When discussing the general occurrence of shoulder injuries in sports such as swim-
ming, in the study by Kerr et al. [ 44] it was found that the main factors of the occurrence of
injuries in swimming was a large training volume and the repetitive nature of the move-
ment. Sein at al. [ 45] assumed that shoulder pain among swimmers is common and its
pathogenesis is uncertain. The authors found that 91% of swimmers aged 13–25 had a shoul-
der joint pain occurrence, 84% had a positive impingement sign and 69% of 52 swimmers
had supraspinatus tendinopathy. It was found that supraspinatus tendinopathy is the major
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022 ,19, 15854 14 of 17
cause of shoulder pain among elite swimmers. Walker et al. [ 46] assessed the frequency of
pain in the shoulder joint among 74 professional swimmers aged 11–27 (including 37 men
and 37 women). Research has shown that 38% of athletes reported signiﬁcant interfering
shoulder pain in the last 12 months of training, and 23% signiﬁcant shoulder injury lasting
for at least 2 weeks. The related pain disrupted or prevented the athletes from training and
competing, which clearly indicates the traumatic nature of swimming associated with the
shoulder joint and the resulting limitations appearing in the course of a sports career.
The results of our research showed a negative correlation between the number of years
of swimming training and the sum of PMS symptoms alleviated by this type of physical
activity. The majority of female athletes stated that swimming reduced lower abdominal
pain (23.44%) and irritability (29.69%), successively swimmers indicated relief of pain in
the lumbosacral region, as well as, reduced tearfulness and depression. In the study by
Khademi et al. [ 47] comparing prevalence of premenstrual syndrome in swimmer and
non-swimmer students it was found that PMS occurred in 36.2% non-swimmers and 22.8%
swimmers. The prevalence of PMS was found to be lower in swimmers. Comparison of
PMS symptoms between swimmers and non-swimmers showed a statistical difference
between symptoms such as: feeling more irritable (swimmers 25.7% vs. non-swimmers
40%), tend to eat more than usual or at irregular hours (respectively 22.9% vs. 34.3%), easily
distracted (22.1% vs. 32.9%), restless behaviour noticeable by others (19.3% vs. 30.7%),
physical symptoms (17.1% vs. 30.7%), change in mood without obvious reason (14.3% vs.
31.4%), signiﬁcant swelling in breasts, ankles, and abdomen (12.9% vs. 26.4%), avoiding
some social commitments (3.6% vs. 13.6%). In the study by Maged et al. [ 48], swimming
has been shown to have a beneﬁcial effect on most of the physical and psychological
PMS symptoms. There were statistically signiﬁcant differences between the group of
swimmers and the control group with regard to the reduction of symptoms, e.g., such
as: anxiety, depression, tension, mood changes, confusion, pain, headache, fatigue, breast
tenderness. No signiﬁcance was found for irritability, insomnia, edema, crying and food
craving. Scientiﬁc research indicates a positive effect of swimming on the reduction of
depression, anxiety, and stress, which is associated with the release of neurotransmitters,
including secretion of -endorphins. The positive effect of this physical activity as a form
of aerobic exercise in relieving nervous tension is also attributed to an increase in the
level of progesterone, which, through neurotransmitters modulated by sex steroids (like
gamma-aminobutyric acid and serotonin), reduces stress and mental tension [49].
The syndrome of relative energy deﬁciency in sport is a clinical entity, the basic
mechanism of which is the lack of sufﬁcient amount of energy from food needed to support
optimal health and physical performance of the organism [ 17,19]. Dietary restrictions, and
thus inadequate energy intake in the diet combined with physical exercise, cause a negative
energy balance in the athlete’s body, leading to serious multi-system health problems, and
thus a decrease in the athlete’s training performance and improper regeneration of the
organism [ 17]. Unfortunately, competitors often manipulate dietary intakes, in order to
control weight and body composition [ 14]. The research [ 13–15] has shown, negative health
consequences that do not occur immediately may turn out to be insufﬁcient for an athlete
to change their eating habits. The factor motivating an athlete to change the diet are only
noticeable decrease in the body’s efﬁciency and a reduced response to training stimuli, and
this already suggests signiﬁcant health problems.
There is a clear need to spread knowledge about FAT and RED-S among athletes, and
in particular among sportswomen, who should be aware that stopping the menstrual cycle
while doing sport is not a comfortable situation allowing for undisturbed training, but the
ﬁrst symptom of energy disorders occurring in a woman’s organism leading to serious
health consequences.
Limitations. The main limitation of this study, which is composition analysis was
performed to determine the actual content of adipose tissue in the body of the examined
women in relation to the lean body mass. The authors relied on the subjective statements of
the athletes which may have made the study somewhat erroneous, but the data collected
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022 ,19, 15854 15 of 17
for analysis was mostly based on a questionnaire of unquestionable scientiﬁc value, which
certainly contributed to the credibility of the obtained results. The main limitation of this
study was the inability to perform long-term studies and to observe whether, for example,
after stopping swimming training, all women had their menstruation cycle back to normal.
5. Conclusions
The research showed that the correct body weight of the athletes and BMI within the
normal range were a positive predictor of the lack of disorders in the menstrual cycle among
the majority of women practicing swimming. Disturbances in the normal menstruation
cycle, occurring among a certain percentage of the swimmers, positively correlated with the
number of injuries that were recorded among these athletes. Any change in the intensity,
frequency or duration of training had an impact on the changes in menstrual bleeding, either
becoming more or less heavy, or leading to amenorrhea. Years of training were a positive
predictor of the ‘more profuse bleeding’. Swimming has been shown to improve some of
the symptoms of PMS. Swimming styles taken as dominant among the examined women
did not signiﬁcantly change the characteristics of the menstrual cycle, but the backstroke
signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced the absence of menstrual cycle lasting less than three months.
