Sports-related injuries are a significant health problem within Australia, and constitute a 
national health priority. There is limited Australian research data available on factors that 
contribute to triathlon injuries, and in particular on how training patterns relate to injury 
risk. This study examined the association between training patterns and injury in mostly 
non-elite triathletes. 
A cross-sectional survey of 258 triathletes completed a questionnaire that focused on 
injuries they had sustained during the previous three triathlon seasons. Statistical assoc- 
iations were found between hours of training and sustaining an injury. These associations 
were U shaped, with those triathletes training at low levels and at high levels more likely to 
sustain an injury. The results suggest that, for non-elite triathletes, the likelihood of 
sustaining an injury is least when training for a total of 8 to 10 hrs per week, specifically 
cycling for five to six hrs and running for three to four hrs weekly. Time spent on swimming 
training does not appear to affect injury risk. 
This research is seen as a contribution towards assisting triathletes in the planning of 
training programs aimed at reducing the risk of injury.

Introduction 
Increased participation in recreational and competitive triathlons over the last 
decade has been accompanied by an increase in numbers of athletes sustaining 
injuries 1. Triathlon is likely to continue to attract growing numbers of parti- 
cipants and injuries are therefore likely to become more prevalent unless more 
emphasis is placed on their prevention. 
Studies which investigated factors relating to levels of training which 
contributed to injury identified that training for or competing in the running 
component of the triathlon resulted in the greatest number of injuries and often 
the most severe followed by cycling. The swimming component was associated 
with the fewest injupes 1-5. 
The literature suggests a linear relationship between training patterns and 
injury occurrence. Risk of injury increased with increased weekly training 
distances, especially for running and cycling 1-a. 
Despite some research on the nature of triathlon injuries there are limited 
data on specific causes of such injuries and fewer on the impact of training 
patterns on injury occurrence. Given the unique nature of triathlon training, it

Training patterns and sports injuries in triathletes 
is of importance to gain some insight into the effects of different levels of 
training. This paper describes a study aimed at elucidating causative factors of 
injuries incurred by people participating in triathlons at a range of levels. 
Specifically the associations between training patterns and injuries are 
presented. Identifying the existence and nature of such associations will be of 
assistance to triathletes who participate at a non-elite level in the preparation 
of training programs that minimise the risk of injury. 
Methods 
A cross-sectional study was conducted with a random sample of 258 tri- 
athletes, using a self-completed questionnaire. Triathletes were asked to report 
on injuries which resulted in one or more of the following consequences: 
• a reduction in the amount or level of sports activity; 
• a need for medical advice or treatment; 
• adverse social or economic effects; and 
• a need to alter training to accommodate the injury. 
A sample of 500 triathletes was randomly selected from the Triathlon 
Association of Western Australia's members' marling list. The majority of adults 
who compete in triathlons in Western Australia, Australia, are members of this 
association, the only one in the State. The questionnaires were mailed to the 
triathletes, and a small prize was offered as an incentive. A total of 276 quest- 
ionnaires were completed (response rate = 55%). Of these, 258 were included in 
the analyses, with 18 excluded because they were from subjects under the age 
of 16 years. 
Descriptive statistics are presented. Logistic regression analyses were con- 
ducted with injury/no injury in last triathlon season as the dependent variable 
and firstly with total hours trained and then with number of hours trained 
weekly in the different disciplines as predictors. A number of possible con- 
founders were assessed for inclusion in the two models. However only highest 
level competed in triathlons was significant. The number of hours trained in 
each discipline were categorised prior to inclusion to allow for non-linear 
relationships between training patterns and injuries. 
ReSUltS 
The final sample (n=258) consisted of 74% males (n=190), aged between 16 and 
63 years (mean=35 years). More than half (62%, n=161) of the triathletes 
participated at a competitive versus a recreational level. However, when asked 
about the highest level at which they had ever competed, only 28% had ever 
competed at a national (16%, n=41) or international (12%, n=32) level, with 
42% (n=108) competing locally and 30% (n=77) at a state level. 
Forty-five percent (n=116) trained six days a week, 30% (n=76) five days and 
16% (n=42) seven days per week. The median total number of hours that they 
participated in triathlon training was 11 hrs per week, with the middle 50% of 
triathletes training between eight and 15 hrs weekly. In terms of total 
kllometres covered, the median was 168 km with 50% of triathletes doing 
between 108 and 239 km per week. 
Sixty-two percent (n= 160) of the sample sustained at least one injury in their 
last triathlon season; 30% (n=77) sustained one injury, 22% (n=56) two injuries 
447 

Training patterns and sports injuries in triathletes 
and 10% (n=27) three or more injuries. With regard to the most significant 
injury sustained, the majority were related to the lower extremities (77%, 
n= 127), of which the knee was the most frequently reported site of injury (32%, 
n=41). 
A statistical association was found between the total hours a triathlete 
trained weekly and sustaining an injury, after controlling for level of triathlon 
participation. Specifically when compared to triathletes who trained a total of 
eight to l0 hrs per week, those triathletes who trained seven or fewer hrs (odds 
ratio=2.24, 95% CI (1.03 ; 4.88 )) and those who trained for 15 hrs or more per 
week (odds ratio=2.23, 95% CI (1.03 ; 4.81)) were more than twice as likely to 
sustain an injury, whilst those who trained between 11 to 14 hrs (odds 
ratio=l.46, 95% CI (0.74 ; 2.86)} were at a slightly higher (non-significant) risk 
of injury. Thus, as illustrated in Figure 1, triathletes training the lowest and the 
highest number of hours were more likely to sustain an injury. 
The results of the logistic regression assessing the effect of hours trained in 
each discipline per week on the risk of sustaining an injury are presented in 
Table 1. The time spent cycling and time spent running were significantly 
associated with sustaining an injury, but the number of hours spent on 
swimming training was not. Triathletes who did cycling training between three 
and four hrs and for seven or more hrs per week had more than 2.5 times 
higher odds of sustaining an injury than those who cycled for five to six hrs. 
Although the trend was not consistent, apart from the lowest category there is 
some evidence of fewer injuries occurring in the intermediate training category 
versus the categories at the ends of the scale. Similarly the odds of sustaining 
an injury were double for triathletes who ran two or fewer hrs and those who 
ran for five or more hrs per week when compared with those who ran for three 
to four hrs in training. Two-way interactions between the disciplines were 
assessed individually (to determine the effect of combinations of training) but 
were non-significant. As expected triathletes who had competed at national or 
higher levels were at an increased risk (twice as likely) of sustaining an injury.

Discussion 
Data from a total sample of 258 triathletes participating at a range of levels 
were analysed for this study. As expected, associations were found between 
levels of training and sustaining an injury. Specifically, the total number of 
hours a triathlete cycled and ran per week had an influence. The results with 
regard to running training are consistent with other studies that found the 
running component of the triathlon was the major contributor to injury 1,3-5. 
Interestingly, U-shaped associations were found for the above training 
patterns and injury. Injuries were sustained more frequently for the lower and 
higher hours spent training than for the middle categories. This U-shape 
distribution of injury was also referred to in a cricket fast bowling workload and 
injury study that suggested maintaining a workload that is too low or too high 
significantly increases the bowler's risk of injury 6. Similarly, it appears that a 
triathlete may be more likely to risk injury when training at low levels and at 
high levels. It is plausible to suggest that the former may be due to lack of 
conditioning, or poor training practices. The latter may be due in part to an 
increased risk of injury due simply to greater participation. However, it is likely 
to be in part the result of overuse and overtraining, which was a contributing 
factor identified by the athletes in this study. 
There were several limitations to this study. The sample was drawn from the 
members of the WA Triathlon Association and thus excluded non-members. 
Although the response rate of 55% is relatively high for a survey of this type, it 
449 

Training patterns and sports injuries in triathletes 
is unclear whether or how it may have impacted on the estimated associations. 
Injuries were self-reported and not confirmed by medical diagnosis. Some 
accuracy may have also been compromised due to retrospectively recalling 
training times. Due to the difficulties in separating the relative contribution of 
training and external factors as causes of injuries, all injuries were included in 
the analyses. 
Conclusions 
The findings of this study are that the triathlon participants who train for the 
longest and the shortest periods of time tend to sustain injuries more often 
than those who train the intermediate lengths of time. The results suggest that, 
particularly for non-elite triathletes, the likelihood of sustaining an injury is 
least when training for a total of eight to 10 hrs per week, and specifically when 
cycling for five to six hrs and running for three to four hrs weekly. Time spent 
on swimming training did not affect injury risk. 
This research is seen as a contribution towards a better understanding of the 
association between levels of training and sustaining an injury and will 
therefore assist triathletes to plan training regimes aimed at reducing the risk 
of injury.
