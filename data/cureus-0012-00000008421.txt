Abstract
Background
This study aimed to determine the frequency of musculoskeletal injuries in master swimmers in
Turkey.
Methods
A questionnaire was formed and distributed to all master swimmers registered with the Turkish
Swimming Federation. The collected data included age, sex, the age to start swimming (SAS),
weekly training time (WTT), weekly training distance (WTD), any painful episode that lasted
more than 10 days in any of the body regions within last one year, any confirmed diagnosis of
musculoskeletal disease by a physician, and history of musculoskeletal surgical operation. The
descriptive data were presented, and multiple comparisons were made according to
demographic characteristics.
Results
There were 88 male swimmers with a mean age of 47.1±13.2 years (range, 26-89 years). Of the
88 athletes, 27 (30.7%) had no pain in daily activities, and 61 (69.3%) reported pain in at least
one region, with a total of 118 pain zones reported. The shoulder was the most common painful
body region (n:37, 42.0%), followed by the lower back (n: 24, 27.3%), neck (n: 19, 21.6%), back
(n:12, 13.6%), and knee (n:9, 10.2%). The mean age, SAS, WTT, WTD, and distribution of stroke
preference were similar in subjects with or without reported pain and diagnosis (p>0.005). Any
painful body region and diagnosis were equally distributed in all swimming styles (p>0.05). The
most common surgeries were lumbar disc disease (16.7%) and meniscectomy (16.7%).
Conclusion
Compared to the findings in the current literature, master swimmers do not have as many
musculoskeletal problems as their younger counterparts. The problems seen in master
swimmers are lower but similar to those in competitive elite swimmers. From the
musculoskeletal health perspective, swimming is safe for the master age group. Swimming can
be safely offered to elderly patients who underwent even musculoskeletal surgery.

Introduction
With a better understanding of the favorable effects of sport on general health, individuals with
or without an active sports background engage in sports suitable for their health conditions at
various ages. Maintaining muscle mass is crucial for a healthy body and a longer life. Exercise
such as swimming builds muscle strength and power and functional ability in the activities of
daily living in older adults 
[1]
. Swimming provides an excellent non-weight-bearing alternative
to exercise for people in all age groups. Unlike jogging or running, swimming does not overload
the musculoskeletal system while it provides cardiovascular conditioning. This is highly
advantageous for older people, especially those with arthritis in their joints. Therefore, many
older people choose to swim as a recreational activity.
However, swimming is not entirely free from injuries. Overuse injuries are especially common
[2]
. In several previous studies, swimming injuries have been well-studied but there are few
epidemiological studies on master swimmers, a relatively older group of athletes 
[3-4]
. This
study aimed to determine the frequency of musculoskeletal injuries in master swimmers
involved in competitive swimming in Turkey and to investigate the relationship of
musculoskeletal problems with stroke preference and other subject characteristics.
Materials And Methods
This study was a prospective observational study conducted on licensed master swimmers over
25 years old. A questionnaire was formed and distributed to all master swimmers registered
with the Turkish Swimming Federation to collect the data. Subjects who were unwilling to
participate in the study and subjects who are not active swimmers for the last three months
were excluded. This study was carried out following the ethical standards laid down in the 1964
Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments, and informed consent was obtained from all
participants. The local ethics committee approved the study protocol. A total of 115 master
swimmers responded and completed the questionnaire. Due to incomplete data entry, 13 were
excluded from the study. As 88 males and 14 females remained, the female swimmers were
excluded due to the insufficient number. Finally, 88 male swimmers were included in the study
for analysis.
The questionnaire included age, the age to start swimming (SAS), weekly training time (WTT),
weekly training distance (WTD), any painful episode lasting more than 10 days in any of the
body regions within the last one year, any confirmed diagnosis of musculoskeletal disease by a
physician, and history of musculoskeletal surgical operation. The questionnaire was
administered to the participants either through a face-to-face interview or a phone call.
Continuous variables were presented as mean and standard deviation, and categorical variables
were stated as count and percentage. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to determine
whether the data were distributed normally. A comparative analysis between independent
groups was performed using the Mann-Whitney U test, independent sample student's t-test,
and chi-square test. A value of p < 0.05 was accepted as statistically significant.
Results
There were 88 male swimmers with a mean age of 47.1±13.2 years (range, 26-89 years). Since
participants competed with more than one swimming style, a total of 149 different styles have
been reported, including freestyle (n:73), breaststroke (n:30), backstroke (n:22), and butterfly
style (n:24). The mean age to start swimming was 22.3±16.9 years (range, 5-60 years). The mean
training time per week was 5.4±2.5 hours (range, 0-12 hours). The mean training distance per
week was 10082.9±7601.8 meters (range, 0-50.000 meters). The mean age to start swimming
was younger in the butterfly style (14.4±13.2 versus 25.3±17.3 p=0.007). Of the 88 athletes, 27

A previous confirmed musculoskeletal diagnosis was reported by 34 (38.6%) swimmers and 54
(61.4%) had no diagnosis of musculoskeletal condition or injury. The most common diagnosis
was related to upper extremity problems (35.6%) (Table

The mean age, SAS, WTT, WTD, and distribution of stroke preference were similar in subjects
with or without confirmed diagnosis (p>0.05 for all variables). The presence of a confirmed
musculoskeletal diagnosis was equally distributed in all swimming styles (p>0.05). A history of
musculoskeletal system surgery was reported by 15 (17%) of the study participants. A total of 18
operations were reported by 15 swimmers. The most common operations were arthroscopic
meniscus surgery (n:3, 16.7%), lumbar discectomy (n:3, 16.7%), and anterior cruciate ligament
reconstruction (n:2, 11.1%). Other surgeries were fibular fracture fixation, forearm fracture
fixation, bilateral total knee replacement, Bankart repair, carpal tunnel release, femoral neck
fracture fixation, humerus fracture fixation, ankle ligamentous repair, and anterior tibial
tendon repair.
Discussion
The results of this study showed that there was no significant relationship between the age of
the master swimmer with pain, diagnosis, and a history of surgery. Baker et al. reported that
swimming-related injury prevalence increased significantly with advancing age 
[5]
. However,
no such relationship has been found in other master athletes 
[6]
. In the current study,
comparisons were made between those who started swimming in childhood and those who
started swimming as adults with respect to WTT, WTL, pain, diagnosis, surgery, and stroke. A
difference between the groups was only determined with respect to stroke. The butterfly stroke
rate of those who started swimming after the age of 18 years was significantly low. Relatively
difficult strokes such as butterflies can be made by those who have been swimming since
childhood. It was observed that butterfly stroke is not preferred by swimmers, who began
swimming in adulthood.
Upper extremity, knee, and spine problems are often seen in elite athletes due to high
repetitive movements during normal swimming 
[2]
. In elite athletes, the injury rate in 1000
hours of exercise has been reported to be 4 in men and 3.78 in women elite swimmers. Shoulder
injuries have been reported to be the most common injuries in swimmers, with a prevalence of
40%-91% 
[7-8]
. This is due to the fact that, unlike in many other sports, the arms are
responsible for the explosive movement for the propulsion of the body.
Shoulder injuries are often manifested by rotator cuff impingement, biceps tendinitis, and
shoulder instability. In a study of 80 elite swimmers, 91% of elite swimmers reported shoulder
pain. While 84% of those athletes had positive impingement findings, 69% of 52 swimmers
with MRI had supraspinatus tendinopathy findings 
[8]
. In the current study, the highest pain
was reported in the shoulder region (42.0%), and the most commonly diagnosed
musculoskeletal pathology was shoulder lesions. However, when previous surgeries were
examined, with the exception of one patient who had a Bankart lesion repair due to instability,
no other patients had undergone shoulder surgery. The relatively low number of shoulder
operations as compared to musculoskeletal pathology and pain could be attributed to master
swimmers not returning to swimming after these operations as much as after other region
surgeries.
Krüger et al. administered a questionnaire to 282 master swimmers, and the incidence of
shoulder pain over three years was 62.4% 
[9]
. Statistically significant relationships were
determined between shoulder pain and the risk factors of osteoporosis, the volume of training,
and competitiveness. However, no significant association was found between age, gender, body
mass index (BMI), swimming stroke, strength training, and the incidence of shoulder pain. In a
study by Tate et al., 64 master swimmers were analyzed, and there was reported to be a 19.4%
rate of shoulder pain and disability 
[10]
. Stocker et al. compared two age groups of collegiate
and master swimmers and reported similar percentages of shoulder pain despite the shorter
distances and lower intensity of training associated with the master group 
[11]
. In the current
study, shoulder pain was the most common pain, and there was no relationship between

training duration and training length.
The knee is the second most frequently reported area of pain for competing swimmers. As with
other swimming injuries, the primary factor is overuse 
[12]
. In a study of competitive
swimmers, 34% reported knee problems 
[13]
. In the current study, the rate of knee pain in
master swimmers was found to be 10.2%. In the literature, knee problems are more common in
breaststroke swimmers 
[14]
. Freestyle swimmers are at a lower risk of knee injuries 
[15]
. Medial
knee pain has been reported by up to 75% of those swimming breaststrokes 
[16]
. Increased
varus and valgus overload and rapid extension in the knee are thought to be responsible. There
is increased tension in the medial compartment and increased compression in the lateral
compartment. Breaststroke has been shown to be responsible for this knee pain with a
thickened inflamed medial plica 
[17]
.
In the current study, when the pathological diagnoses of the knee joint are examined, 24.5% of
all the pathological diagnoses were in the knee region. The swimming styles of individuals with
a diagnosis of meniscus lesions alone were examined, and it was seen that this group only swam
freestyle. Of the master swimmers who had undergone meniscectomy, both breaststroke and
freestyle were seen. Although freestyle is seen as the standard swimming stroke of all master
swimmers, it can be concluded that master swimmers can continue to swim breaststroke even
after meniscectomy surgery.
Compared to elite athletes in the literature, it was observed that breaststroke swimming master
athletes had fewer knee symptoms. Nichols stated that symptoms from a degenerative
meniscus tear in an older athlete might be exacerbated by breaststroke swimming due to the
forceful rotatory and valgus loads on the knee 
[18]
. In the current study, the master swimmers
with a diagnosis of meniscus lesion did not report swimming breaststroke.
Lower back problems, including lumbar discs, are common in swimmers. Various levels of the
degenerative disc have been shown in 68% of elite swimmers and 29% of recreational
swimmers 
[19]
. Exercise frequency, duration, and distance have been reported to increase
lumbar spine disc degeneration in competing swimmers. In the present study, no relationship
was found between exercise duration and distance and any musculoskeletal condition. Kaneoka
et al. showed no change in disc disease according to gender or swimming style 
[19]
. In contrast,
Nyksa et al. stated that, especially in breaststroke and butterfly, the excessive hyperextension
of the lower back forces the posterior lower back structures to cause spondylolysis and
spondylolisthesis 
[20]
. In particular, low back pain was found in 33.3% of butterfly and 22.2% of
breaststroke swimmers 
[21]
. In the current study, master swimmers reported pain in the spine
region as in the lower back (27.3%), neck (21.6.1%), and back (13.6%), respectively. The lumbar
region was the second most common region of pain after the shoulder. Lumbar disc disease was
ranked second after shoulder lesions in terms of diagnosed pathology (17.7%). A history of
lumbar disc surgery was reported by 16.7% of the current study participants. Those with low
back pain and lumbar disc disease were found to swim all strokes, and those with operated
lumbar disc disease only swam freestyle. It was observed that the swimmers with a lumbar
pathology of a serious enough level to require surgery did not prefer breaststroke and butterfly
styles. However, those with low back pain or un-operated lumbar disc disease could swim all
styles, including butterfly and breaststroke. As the amount of competition for master swimmers
is relatively low compared to elite athletes, with the exception of those with serious low back
problems requiring surgery, master swimmers with lumbar disc disease or lumbar pain could
continue to swim butterfly and breaststroke. Spondylolisthesis was reported in one patient,
and this patient could only swim breaststroke.
Female swimmers have been shown to experience significantly more knee, lower back, neck,
shoulder, hip, and foot problems 
[22]
. Since the questionnaires of only male patients were

examined, no gender comparison could be performed in the current study.
There are few studies in the literature of the musculoskeletal injuries and diagnoses of master
swimmers, but there are comparisons of elite athletes and other master athletes.
Studies on musculoskeletal injuries in master swimmers are limited. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first study on the musculoskeletal injuries of master swimmers in Turkey.
Only one study was reported related to the epidemiological data of swimmers in Turkey, which
included 38 competitive male swimmers, and the prevalence of musculoskeletal problems was
determined as 60.52% 
[21]
. In studies of master athletes other than master swimmers, injuries
common to master athletes include rotator cuff injuries, Achilles tendinopathies, and meniscal
tears 
[23]
.
Ganse et al. stated that healthy master athletes have a lower risk of injuries and illnesses during
competition than young elite athletes 
[24]
. In a study by Walsh et al., the results suggested that
healthy master athletes have a low risk of injury that does not increase with age or performance
[25]
. In the current study, it was also found that master swimmers had a lower incidence of
injury as compared to reports of elite swimmers in literature.
There are some limitations of this study, primarily that only male master swimmers were
included. This observational study is not free of selection bias, thus casual relationships cannot
be definitively drawn. Personal details that can lead to musculoskeletal problems, such as BMI
or osteoporosis, were not studied. Nevertheless, this study is one of the very few studies on the
epidemiology of injuries in master swimmers.
Conclusions
Master swimmers appear to have fewer musculoskeletal problems than their younger
counterparts reported in the current literature. Master swimmers who have undergone surgery
for musculoskeletal problems can continue swimming. As swimming improves physical
performance without any impact on the weight-bearing joints, it provides a safe opportunity to
improve physical condition. The problems seen in master swimmers are similar to but at a
lower rate than those in competitive, elite swimmers. For elderly patients, even those who have
undergone musculoskeletal surgery, but not shoulder surgery, swimming can be safely
recommended.
