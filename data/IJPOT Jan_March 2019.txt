ABSTRACT
Aims:	To	find	out	the	prevalence	and	various	risk	factors	for	falls	among	older	adults	(60-75	years).
Objective: To sensitize O.T intervention program among older adults by providing health education booklet.
Material and Method : It is a cross-sectional community based study in which 100 people (aged 60-75 
years)	were	interviewed,	 out	of	100,	54	were	women	and	46	were	men.100	people,	fulfilling	the	inclusion	
criteria	and	they	were	asked	to	given	a	written	consent	for	the	participation	 in	the	study.	General	evaluation	
of older adults was carried out. They were assessed by face to face interview using Johns Hopkins fall risk 
assessment tool (JHFRAT).Scale was in English so each question was explained by the researcher in Hindi.
Result: The	finding	of	present	study	shows	that	in	total	100	subjects	of	older	adults	(male	and	female	both)	
60-75 years, the prevalence of fall is 27.69%, and the risk of fall is found (56/100) 56% older people has 
moderate fall risk, (12/100) 12% has high fall risk and (32/100) 32% has low fall risk.
Conclusion: This study concluded that the history of falls, poor vision, use of multiple medications, chronic 
disease, use of walking aids, vertigo and balance problems were associated with falls among the older adults. 
So there is a need to develop occupational therapy health education awareness program to prevent these 
problems and risk of falls.

INTRODUCTION
India	as	the	second	most	population’s	 country	in	the	
world which has seen a sharp increase in the population 
of the older adults.
Every year nearly one third of accidental falls occur 
in those aged more than 60 years with 10% of these falls 
resulting	in	serious	injury.
Falling in older adults can lead to hospitalization, 
disability and premature death. It can also reduce the level of independence, high level of anxiety and poorer 
quality of life.
In INDIA the prevalence of falls has been estimated 
as 14%to 53%.[1]
There are several intrinsic or extrinsic factors which 
is considered responsible for falls among older adults and 
reduced	their	QOL,	affect	their	activity	of	daily	living,	
gait	and	balance	deficit	and	cognitive	impairment.[3]
O.T practitioner can provide the home and 
environmental	 modifications,	 exercises,	 and	practical	
support to enable people to overcome any barriers that 
prevent them from doing an activities.
This	helps	to	increase	people’s	independent	 to	be	
able perform their activity of daily living and maintain 
their dignity and satisfaction in all aspects of life.
O.T interventions and treatment plans for fall 
prevention include positive risk-taking in activity, 
maximizing functional performance, improving self-Corresponding Author:

confidence	 and	social	engagement.	 Environmental	
advice	and	modification	 to	reduce	home	hazards,	
education and practice in safe moving and handling, with 
provision of equipment as required, are also appropriate. 
All interventions should promote independence and

PROCEDURE
This study was a community based study. By using 
quota sampling method 100 aged 60-75 years who have 
risk for falls were interviewed, out of 100, 54 women 
and 46 men took part in this study.
The language I choose is English and I also make 
people to understand the questions in Hindi so that the 
questioned must not be ignored or answered incorrectly. Considering the previous literature available, I excluded 
the	older	adults	who	were	diagnosed	 with	any	major	
trauma not related to fall, cardiovascular or psychiatric 
conditions, any infections or tumor. After selecting the 
older adults for the sampling, the interviewer conducted 
door to door survey. Before proceeding to the inclusion-
exclusion criteria and were willing to participate in the 
study they were then asked to provide their demographical 
details any present or past fall history, current illness, 
medical history, surgical history musculoskeletal history 
and information for body mass index (height, weight).
After explaining the need and purpose of the study a duly 
signed written consent was obtained from each person. 
The scale were administered to all of them.

DISCUSSION
Literature	 on	geriatrics	 professional	 suggest	the	
evident prevalence of risk factors for falls among 
elderly people in the age of 60-95 years ( PRADNYA 
DHARGA VE, September 2016) explained that in India, 
the prevalence of falls has been estimated as 14-53%.
My	study	is	on:	To	find	out	the	prevalence	 and	
various risk factors for falls among older adults (60-75 
years) community NCR Delhi. A total of 100 older men 
and	women	were	assessed	from	JHFRAT.	The	findings	
of present study show that the prevalence of falls in 
older	adults	is	27.69%,	which	means	in	every	8	person	
there is one fall exists.
FAISAL YOUSUF ALMEGBEL et al. (2018) 
reported	that	approximately	 28%	to	35%	of	people	aged	
65	and	over	fall	each	year.	The	consequent	 injuries	of	
falls	are	considered	 major	public	health	problems.  
Falls	account	for	more	than	half	of	injury-related	
hospitalizations	 among	elderly	people.	The	major	
underlying causes of falls lead to hip fractures, TBI, and 
upper	limb	injuries.	In	addition,	unintentional	 falls	are	
the	fifth	leading	cause	of	death	in	elderly	people.	
In 100 population there is 54 women and 46 men 
who participated in this study in which the history of 
     4      Indian Journal of Physiotherapy and Occupational Therapy, January-March 2019, Vol.13, No. 1
fall is present in women is 35% (19/54) and in men is 
34.7% (16/46).This result is show that more women 
had a history of falling than men. Many other studies 
found	similar	results.	According	 to	WORLD	HEALTH	
ORGANISATION	 report,	about	one-fifth	of	fall	related	
to death in 2004 occurred in India.
This study is also found out the various risk factors 
for falls among older adults which is categorized in high, 
moderate and low fall risk according to JHFRAT Scale. 
According to RAGHUPATHY SENDHILKUMAR 
et al. (2016) the risk factors considered responsible for 
elderly people. Important factors are weakness, arthritis, 
history of falls, impaired activities of daily living, gait 
deficit,	depression,	 balance	deficit,	cognitive	impairment, 	
use	of	assistive	devices,	visual	deficit,	medication	 (certain	
psychiatric drugs, antiarrhythmic drugs)
In	total	100	subjects	of	older	adults	(male	and	
female both) 60-75 years the moderate fall risk is found 
(56/100) 56%, high fall risk is found (12/100) 12% and 
low fall risk is found (32/100) 32%.
There	is	three	group	divided	of	age,	first	60-65	
years-they have 54 people out of 100 in which (30/54) 
55.5% people on moderate fall risk, (22/54) 40% people 
on low fall risk and (2/54)  3.7% people on high fall risk.
Second 66-70 years-they have 30 people in this 
group	out	of	100	in	which	(18/30)	60%	people	on	
moderate fall risk, (7/30) 23% people on low fall risk, 
(5/30) 16.6% people on high fall risk.
Third 71-75 years-they have 16 people out of 100 in 
which	(8/16)	50%	people	on	moderate	fall	risk,	(3/16)	
18%	people	on	low	fall	risk	and	(5/16)	31%	people	on	
high fall risk.
This study shows that the large number of people is 
on moderate fall risk.
This study can be used for future research and 
planning	of	effective	strategies	to	prevent	falls	among	
older adults.
CONCLUSION
This study concluded that the history of falls, poor 
vision, use of multiple medications, chronic disease, 
use of walking aids, vertigo and balance problems were 
associated with falls among the older adults population 
living in community Delhi NCR.The risk of such falls increases with age and has 
a strong relationship with the health status of these 
elderly individuals. There is, therefore a need to develop 
occupational therapy health education awareness 
program to prevent these problems and risk of falls.
I am also grateful to my family and friends who 
are the ultimate source of strength and their love and 
sacrifice	over	the	years	who	have	opened	countless	
opportunities for me.

ABSTRACT
Assistive	Technology	 (AT)	can	have	significant	 beneficial	effects	for	people	with	disabilities	 (PwDs)	but	
there are also many barriers to their use. These barriers need to be analyzed in order to improve their 
overall quality of life. Accessible India Campaign under the Department of Empowerment of Persons 
with Disabilities (DEPwD), Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, aims at achieving universal 
accessibility for persons with disabilities and to create an enabling and barrier-free environment for them. 
While	assistive	technologies	 such	as	advanced	wheelchairs	 may	help	PwDs	become	employed	or	return	to	
work,	many	non-technological 	barriers	cause	that	promise	to	go	unfulfilled.	 In	this	reference	the	present	
study has been done to identify various barriers to the use of AT among the PwDs in India by conducting a 
survey	in	different	parts	of	the	country.	India	has	over	70	million	plus	people	in	the	disabled	category	and	
the use of AT is of great importance for them. This study aims to explore various barriers to implementing 
assistive technology for PwDs in Indiato help them to live an independent and productive life.

Accessibility is a measure of the extent to which 
a product or service can be used by a person with a 
disability	as	effectively	 as	it	can	be	used	by	a	person	
without that disability.
Over	a	billion	of	the	world’s	population	 has	some	
form	of	disability.	They	are	the	world’s	largest	minority.	
This	figure	is	on	a	constant	increase	due	to	increase	in	
the population as well as the medical advances that have 
decreased mortality due to old age. At the same time 
PwDs are experiencing a lack of access to technologies 
due to visual, hearing, mental, and/or other impairments that	make	it	difficult	to	operate	various	devices.	Other	
groups facing accessibility issues are illiterate and 
elderly populations.
Studies show that at least one billion people from 
all over the world belong to the older aged category 
who may acquire certain disabilities due to age related 
conditions. They generally prefer to continue living in 
their own homes rather than move into residential age 
care institutions. AT in the home environment and/or 
bodily	worn	systems	that	monitor	people’s	movement	
might contribute to an increased sense of safety and 
security at home. However, their use can raise ethical 
anxieties as little is known about how older persons 
perceive assistive and monitoring technologies.
Another	major	category	includes	children	with	
multiple	disabilities	 who	can	efficiently	 improve	access	
and participation in their school and home environments 
by	the	use	of	AT.	Effective	educational	 outcomes	from	
AT use are dependent upon a coordinated assessment 
and implementation process. Making resources and 
information accessible to persons with disabilities is 
of great importance in this scenario as more and more 
people will start requiring accessibility.DOI Number: 10.5958/0973-5674.2019.00002.9 
Indian Journal of Physiotherapy and Occupational Therapy, January-March 2019, Vol.13, No. 1          7      
There	is	evidence	that	AT	can	have	significant	
beneficial	effects	for	children	with	multiple	disabilities.1,2 
There is also a strong indication, however, that AT is 
currently implemented within educational environments 
in a less than optimal manner.3,4
India is home to 2.7 crore people living with one or 
the other kind of disability. Unlike the developed world, 
India’s	disabled	are	made	further	sociallyvulnerable	 by	
lack	of	quality	education,	 lack	of	women’s	safety,	and	
attitudinal barriers as they continue to grapple with the 
challenges of access, acceptance, and inclusion. 
Until a few decades ago, it was almost unimaginable 
for the disabled to lead independent lives. The advent 
of technology and internet has, however, opened new 
doors. A print-impaired person can now listen to audio 
books and learn. The Ministry of Social Justice and 
Empowerment has recently announced Sugamaya 
Pustakalaya, an online library where books are made 
available	in	different	accessible	 formats	for	people	with	
visual impairment and other print disabilities.
In developing countries such as India, the road 
to accessibility is a long, winding one. Although in 
recent times assistive devices have been extensively 
prescribed, there are few evaluations of the barriers to 
their utilization. The purpose of this paper is to identify 
the potential barriers faced by the people with disabilities 
in using the AT by conducting survey and by reviewing 
the available literature.
REVIEW OF LITERATURE
Many researchers have worked on the uses and 
benefits	of	AT	for	the	people	of	all	ages	with	multiple	
disabilities but a little literature is available on the 
barriers faced by PwDs in India in using it. Although 
developments in AT are present to enhance the quality 
of life of the people with multiple disabilities, many 
instructors feel intimidated and unsuccessful in this 
endeavor because of barriers they face in implementing 
technology they lack knowledge about.
Children with multiple disabilities often face 
barriers to accessing and participating in self-care, 
play, leisure and education.5 AT has been employed 
as one strategy, particularly in educational settings, to 
enable these children to participate more fully in various 
activities.1,3,6,7Studies of AT utilization have suggested infrequent 
use of prescribed devices in home, vocational and 
community settings,3,8 poor rates of use by teachers 
and other professionals who work with children with 
multiple disabilities,9 and concerns regarding the way in 
which AT programmes are being implemented at school 
and at home.1,4,10 Reasons given for abandonment of 
devices have been expressed in broad terms, such as the 
device	being	‘unsuitable’ 	for	the	child.11
Multiple studies that have followed AT usage 
longitudinally by children with severe and multiple 
disabilities	 suggest	that	it	is	difficult	to	identify	any	
one	factor	that	limits	effective	AT	application.	 Rather,	
it is likely that problems arise from an interaction of 
factors associated with the people, services, systems and 
processes that currently guide AT practice.1,3,10-13
AT	provides	numerous	 benefits	for	PwDs.	It	can	
be used to overcome the social, infrastructure and 
other barriers experienced by disabled people that 
prevent their full and equal participation in all aspects 
of society.14 Similarly, it has been pointed out that AT 
allows people to continue in their normal roles and 
meet their expectations of life despite their physical 
impairment and disability.15
Occupational therapists have a critical role in 
the assessment and implementation of AT needs, 
particularly in determining ways for the child to 
interface	effectively	 with	the	technology.16,17,18,19,20,21 
However, in an examination of occupational therapy 
training programmes in the early 1990s, minimal course 
content	related	to	AT	was	identified,	 suggesting	 that	
occupational therapy graduates may be ill-prepared 
to	fulfill	their	roles	in	technology	 teams.16,17 Further 
research	confirmed	 that	school-based	 occupational	
therapists found to use AT with only a small percentage 
of their caseload. A principal reason cited for low rates 
of	use	was	insufficient	 expertise	to	allow	investigation	
and	application	of	different	devices.19
One of the main barriers in accessing AT in less 
resourced	settings	is	the	lack	of	funds.	Limited	financial	
resources, lack of leadership and governance in many 
countries	 have	a	major	impact	on	availability	 and	
accessibility of AT.22,23 In addition, service delivery 
including referral, assessment, funding, ordering, product 
preparation,	 fitting,	adjusting,	 user	training,	follow-up,	
maintenance and repairs, hinder the use of AT.24
     8      Indian Journal of Physiotherapy and Occupational Therapy, January-March 2019, Vol.13, No. 1
Lack	of	personnel	with	proper	training	in	appropriate	
mobility	device	services	is	also	a	major	barrier.	In	many	
developing countries like India, production of mobility 
devices is done only on a small scale, or perhaps not 
at all, due to limited access to materials, machinery and 
expertise.25
METHODOLOGY
A survey was conducted through a questionnaire 
among a sample of about 100 PwDs belonging to all 
age	from	different	cities	of	India.	The	questionnaire	
was distributed to occupational therapists working 
in	different	parts	of	India.	With	their	help	the	PwDs	
were interviewed and the data were collected through 
electronic media. In case of children their parents/ 
guardians were interviewed. Both the persons who were 
already using assistive devices and those who were in 
need of assistive devices were included. Among those 
waiting for assistive technology, there were participants 
who had used it previously and been forced to discontinue 
because of some reasons.
The	questionnaire	 contained	 18	multiple	choice	
questions related to the problems associated with the 
use of AT. For the study each participant was separately 
interviewed to identify the problems related to the use 
of AT. Interviewing participants separately provided an 
opportunity to them to speak freely about what restricts 
them to use AT. The research questions that guided this 
study were categorized in following sections: 
 zGeneral	Information
 zType of disability
 zAffordability	and	quality	of	 AT
 zRepairing and maintenance of AT 
 zPsychosocial barriers
 zAwareness and Policies regarding use of AT
In addition to the survey, the literature available on 
barriers to the use of AT in India was also reviewed as 
a part of study in order to identify current barriers to 
effective	incorporation	of	 AT	among	PwDs.
ANALYSIS OF SURVEY
While	AT	improves	the	quality	of	life	of	persons	by	
facilitating activities of daily living, there are also many barriers to their use. This study aims to describe these 
barriers among PwDs in India.

RESULT AND DISCUSSION
With	rising	life	expectancy,	 there	is	a	rapid	increase	
in the number of elderly persons worldwide. The need 
for elderly care in India is similar to the global scenario 
with some factors pertinent to India like a changing 
family system, a rural urban divide, gender-based beliefs 
and	a	lack	of	facilities	that	need	to	be	addressed.	 Lack	
of	awareness	 about	new	assistive	devices	was	a	major	
hindrance in using AT by elderly population in India.
India is a developing country and around 30% of 
total	population	 lives	below	the	poverty	line.	The	major	
barriers for not making use of AT were found to include 
lack of funding and high cost of these devices. Most 
of them do not earn enough to buy these devices and 
depend	totally	on	Government/	 NGOs	for	funding.	Even	
if	they	manage	to	get	these	devices	the	next	major	issue	
is the repairing and maintenance of the device which is 
again	very	costly	and	unaffordable	for	such	people.
The	prime	barrier	faced	by	people	who	are	financially	
sound	is	the	scarcity	of	skilled	professionals.	 Lack	of	
awareness about newer and quality devices amongst 
these professionals restricts them to recommend a 
compatible device. Some of the existing users got 
information from various other sources, such as friends 
and	the	media.	Another	major	barrier	to	the	effective	use	
and implementation of AT is the lack of training facilities 
for the instructors. As a result, they are unable to give 
complete information about the use and maintenance of 
prescribed devices.
The socio-psychological attributes greatly hinder the 
adoption of AT. Sometimes the unintentional negative 
social behavior promotes a sense of positive discrimination; 
pity and sympathy for PwDs which can make them feel 
self-conscious resulting in hindering the adoption of AT. 
Curiosity and unwanted attention from others can also lead 
to discrimination, thus hindering its usage.
The survey gives people a chance to share their 
experiences and opinions about AT with researchers and 
policy-makers who make guidelines and regulations 
for these technologies. The results show that multiple 
barriers exist for the use of assistive devices for PwDs in 
India	which	may	have	a	major	impact	on	their	lives	and	
livelihoods and may reduce their quality of life. Most of 
the people surveyed in this study believe that the use of 
proper AT can reduce stress and as a result can help to 
improve their quality of life so that they would be able to 
contribute greatly towards society.CONCLUSION
The	first-time	 users	faced	economic	 barriers,	
availability barriers, awareness barriers and 
psychological barriers, whereas persons already using 
AT faced repair and maintenance barriers, accessibility 
barriers and psychological barriers in addition to the 
barriers	encountered	 by	the	first-time	users.	To	sum	
up, lack of awareness and unavailability of repair/
maintenance	 services	is	considered	 to	be	a	major	barrier	
for existing users. Consequently, they do not feel any 
significant	 improvement	 in	their	quality	of	life	because	
of	poor	accessibility	 and	difficulty	in	finding	a	place	to	
repair assistive devices.
Thus there is a need for expansion of current 
technology adoption models to give them an increasingly 
balanced outlook. Therefore, in order to increase the 
use of AT, there is a great need for skilled occupational 
therapists who can understand the feelings and 
experiences of PwDs. Also the local infrastructure and 
accessibility facilities, heightening public awareness, 
ensuring funding and a continuous supply of assistive 
devices supported by maintenance services should be 
improved. Persons with physical disabilities should be 
helped to gain more knowledge about assistive devices, 
especially about the availability of more modern ones. 
They should be given support to modify their physical 
and social environments.

ABSTRACT
Background:  Sprinting is an essential component in many sports and can distinguish between good and 
better athletes during team sports performance. The sprint test is used to discriminate players performance 
across	different	ages	and	levels	of	competition	 and	the	inter	sprint	trial.	It	is	thought	that	this	information	
would be of importance to strength and conditioning coaches in analyzing and planning the sprint and 
resistance	training	of	field	sport	athletes	in	and	around	Belagavi	city.
Objective: 	The	primary	objective	of	this	study	is	to	quantify	the	time	taken	to	perform	40	yard	dash	in	
young	athletes	aged	18–25	years.	The	secondary	 objective	is	to	set	concrete	data	which	will	prove	as	a	
base	line	for	any	other	studies	which	will	involve	designing	rehabilitation	 and/or	fitness	protocol	for	Indian	
athletic population
Methodology: 	132	athletes	(n=132)	were	screened	for	the	study.	The	normative	 data	was	collected	for	the	
40	yard	dash	test.	 Age	criteria	was	18-25	yrs.	Speed	of	every	participant	was	recorded.
Result:  The results of this study found that 40 yards DASH Test performance of male participants of mean 
age 20.31±2.21 ranged from 4.00-6.90 seconds and female participants of mean age 20.22±1.97 ranged from 
4.00-6.87	seconds.
Conclusion:  This study concluded that the values of 40 yard DASH Test ranged between 4.00-6.90 for both 
genders with male athletes showing better performance than females.

Speed is an essential component in many sports 
that can distinguish between good and better athletes 
during various sports performance.1 The sprint 
includes	different	phases	including	first	step	quickness,	
acceleration, maximum velocity and deceleration. First 
step	quickness	is	the	first	0-5m	phase	of	sprinting	which	
is usually included in the acceleration phase, particularly characterized by foot initiation and high propulsion force 
2-3 and is of extreme importance as the performance of 
sprinting relies on this phase.4-6 Acceleration is the next 
phase that is initiated to generate maximum velocity 
throughout the performance till last 5m distance prior 
to	the	finishing	line	which	needs	large	muscles	of	lower	
limb to be powerful.6 Sprint performance is essential 
component in many sports for a multitude of reasons 
from winning a race to providing an advantage during 
sprint duels that allow players to reach the ball before 
the opponent.8 Hence, improving training methods 
to enhance sprint performance in athletes is of great 
importance which can be achieved through long-term 
strength training program.7
In many sporting activities such as tennis, squash, 
basketball, soccer, the athletes never attain maximum 
speed during sprinting. In fact, sprints most frequently DOI Number: 10.5958/0973-5674.2019.00003.0

occur	over	very	short	distances	(0–10	m)	from	both	
standing and rolling starts. Consequently, the speed over 
the	first	steps	and	the	ability	to	accelerate	 quickly	would	
be considered of greater importance.9,10 A total seven 
studies reported the reliability of over ground sprinting 
in youth population.11-13 Intra- and inter day sprinting 
distances	of	10,	20,	30	and	40	m	ranged	from	0.83–
2.07%.	Intra-	and	inter-day	distances	ranged	from	0.88	
and	0.98	for	10–40	m	and	person	correlation	 coefficient	
from	0.90–0.97.14–17
Yetter et al., found that Heavy Back Squat(HBS) 
treatment	 produced	 significantly	 greater	speeds	than	
cycling during the 10- to 20 m interval and Heavy Front 
Squats(HFS) during the 30- to 40-m interval following 6 
bouts of sprint interval training performed over 6 weeks 
period.18 Hence, multidimensional nature of sprint 
running	that	demands	different	levels	of	muscle	activation	
can be achieved by incorporating HBS into the warm-up 
procedure. This is a very important topic of research that 
has not been adequately investigated as sprint test has 
an ability to discriminate players performance across 
different	ages	and	levels	of	competition	 and	the	inter	
sprint	trial	effect.	In	fact,	the	data	obtained	through	
sprint test can be turned into valuable information on 
the unique physiological demands of various sports 
performance. Additionally, such a test can guide coaches 
more	effectively	 to	design	conditioning	 and	training	
programs across a season and also can help them to 
better	understand	differences	between	players.
MATERIALS & METHODOLOGY
Materials Used:
 zConsent form
 zData collection sheet
Apparatus and Equipment:
 zMeasuring Tape
 zCones
 zStopwatch
Methodology: Ethical clearance was obtained from the 
Institutional	 Ethical	Committee	 of	KAHER	Institute	of	
Physiotherapy, 132 young adults were recruited to the 
study	after	fulfilment	 of	eligibility	 criteria.	A	written	
informed consent was obtained from all the participants 
before the commencement of the study. The participants were from the various institutes and sports academies in 
and around Belagavi city. Demographic characteristics 
of the participant, including their age, gender, age at 
start of sporting event and years of playing were noted. 
Athletes	within	the	age	group	of	18-25	year	of	age	both	
male and female who were willing to participate were 
included in the study. Participants were excluded if there 
were any musculoskeletal problems such as fracture and 
sprain/strain of lower limb in the past 1 year, existing 
neurological, respiratory or cardio vascular problems or 
any other condition leading to limitation in 40 yard dash 
test performance.
Outcome measures
40 Yard Dash Test :
Equipment Required: Measuring tape/measured track, 
stop watch, cone markers, unobstructed grass/track 
surface of 60 yards.
Procedure: Aim of this test is to determine acceleration 
and a reliable indicator of speed, agility and quickness. 
The test involves running a single maximum sprint over 
40 yards, with the time recorded. A thorough warm up is 
given, including some practice starts and accelerations. 
Test is started from a comfortable stationary 3-point 
stance position, a position that is most familiar to athlete. 
The front foot must be on or behind the starting line. 
The starting position to be held for 3 seconds prior to 
starting.	The	subjects	are	allowed	to	across	the	starting	
line, but no rocking movements are allowed. The tester 
provides hints to maximize speed and encouragement to 
continue	running	hard	past	the	finish	line.
The results are obtained from two trials. Best time 
is recorded on the nearest 2 decimal places. The start 
is	taken	from	the	first	movement	 or	when	the	timing	
system	is	triggered,	 and	finish	when	the	chest	crosses	
the	finish	line.24
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
The statistical analysis was done by using SPSS 
version 21 software. Correlation between BMI, speed 
and number of years played with best time was analysed 
using	Karl	Pearson’s	 correlation	 coefficient	 method.	
Comparison of male and females with mean best time, 
mean	of	first	and	second	attempts	speed	score,	mean	
number of years played and BMI were analysed using 
t test.

DISCUSSION
The	primary	objective	of	this	study	was	to	quantify	
the time taken by the athlete to perform 40 yard dash test. 
The	secondary	 objective	was	to	set	concrete	data	which	
would prove as a base line for any other studies that 
would	involve	designing	 a	rehabilitation	 and/or	fitness	
protocol for Indian athletic population. Percentage of 
male participant included were 71.97 as compared to 
28.03	of	female	participants.	 Out	of	the	total	population	
included	in	the	study	(n=132),	16	samples	fell	under	
excellent	category,	98	participant	 showed	good	time	and	
Indian Journal of Physiotherapy and Occupational Therapy, January-March 2019, Vol.13, No. 1          15      
19 samples performed poorly . Speed in 1st as well as 2nd 
attempt	had	positive	correlation(r=0.924)	 and	(r=0.928)	
with number of years played. Here comparison of male 
and female with mean of 1st and 2nd attempt speed scores 
was	done	and	showed	significant	 (p-value=0.0001)	
speed scores in both the attempts.
The study done by Nesser et. al. concluded that 
both	10-m	sprint	and	5-step	jump	can	be	used	to	predict	
40-m sprint performance. He explained the importance 
of a quick start and rapid acceleration, strength of knee 
flexors	and	hip	extensors	to	propel	the	body	forward,	
and the capacity of these muscles to rapidly contract and 
produced the force needed to create velocity concurrent 
with 40-m sprint performance.20Another study conducted 
by	Mike	Yetter	and	Gavin	Moir	showed	that	heavy	back	
squat	treatment	 produced	significantly	 greater	speeds	
than cycling during the 10- to 20 m interval, although 
the	improvements	 were	not	significantly	 different	from	
the	heavy	front	squat	treatment.	 It	is	difficult	to	explain	
this improvement in terms of the mechanical similarities 
between the back squat movement and the sprinting 
movement during this phase. The improvements by 
heavy front squat during the 10- to 20-m interval 
were less than those recorded during the 30- to 40-m 
interval.	It	is	possible	that	the	improvements	 reflect	the	
importance of the knee and ankle musculature during the 
10- to 20-m interval of sprinting.18
Ronnestadand	 Ellefsen	 identified	 that	the	
preconditioning exercise performed with whole 
body vibration at 50 Hz may enhance 40 m sprint 
performance.19Another study was conducted by Jason 
B.	Wincheste,	 et		al		The	results	of	this	study	suggest	
that performing a static stretching  protocol following 
a dynamic warm up will inhibit sprint performance 
in collegiate athletes.21 Abrantes,et al. concluded that 
professional players exhibited higher performances in 
sprint	test	that	seems	to	be	the	result	of	a	combined	effect	
of age and level of competition. In all groups, the fatigue 
effects	were	the	strongest	between	5th	to	the	7th	sprint,	
which may help the coaches to plan the training more 
effectively.	 Lamb	K	concluded	 that	individuals	 between	
age group of 16-24 spent twice time as compare to their 
older counterparts.22
CONCLUSION
This study concluded that the values of 40 yard DASH 
Test ranged between 4.00-6.90 for both genders with male 
athletes showing better performance than females.Limitations & scope
 zMale female ratio ratio 1:3
 zType of sports and its ratio was not measured
Practical applications:  The result of the present study 
can be used as a reference for (40 yard dash ) sprint 
performance	 test	as	well	as	by	fitness	professionals	 to	
check prognosis after training.

ABSTRACT
Background:  Menstruation in India has been always surrounded by many myths and traditional beliefs, 
which can, not only lead to ignorance in females regarding the facts about menstruation but also encourage 
a faulty perception of the physiological process.  Hence this research was undertaken to assess varied 
Attitudes, Beliefs and Customs about menstrual health in urban and rural adolescents through a pre-validated 
questionnaire.
Method:  A retrospective, cross-sectional study was conducted amongst 300 adolescent girls from the rural 
belt	of	Khopoli	and	urban	section	of	Mumbai,	Maharashtra,	 with	urban	to	rural	ratio	of	1:1,	with	the	help	of	
a pre-validated questionnaire. Data were analysed statistically by simple proportions.
Results: The study revealed that  ‘curse	of	God’,	‘removal	of	impure	blood’	etc	were	the	responsible	
for the menstrual cycle. Uterus was considered as the body part that discharged blood. Maximum study 
subjects	irrespective	 of	their	place	of	residence	found	it	easy	to	discuss	personal	matters	like	those	related	
to menstruation with their mother.
The	most	common	beliefs	in	both	the	groups	were	that	the	menstruating	 girl	shouldn’t	wear	new	clothes,	
should	not	touch	particular	objects,	should	not	enter	temples	and	should	not	attend	social	functions.	 The	
prevalence of these beliefs, was however, more in the rural population in comparison with the urban 
population.
Conclusions: Based	upon	the	findings	of	research,	we	conclude	that	even	though	the	girls	living	in	an	urban	
have	parents	with	a	higher	education	 qualification	 as	compared	 to	the	girls	with	a	rural	setup,	there	are	
various myths and beliefs surrounding menstruation in both the setups.

is the monthly discharge of blood from the vagina, to 
prepare the body for the possibility of pregnancy. The 
physiology of menstruation is primarily governed by the 
cyclical	fluctuation	 of	hormones-ovarian	 oestrogen	and	
progesterone, taking place in the body.Apart from being extremely important for the 
continuation of human race, menstruation can also 
serve	as	a	health	indicator	of	a	woman’s	body.	The	
hormonal changes that take place during menstruation 
have	various	effects	on	the	different	systems	of	the	
body.	Oestrogens	 are	C-18	steroids	synthesized	 from	
cholesterol in the ovary is a mediator of a multitude of 
biological functions.1 Several forms of oestrogen are 
active within the female body. The oestrogen receptors 
are found in hair, skin, bone, soft tissues, adrenal gland, 
thyroid gland — to name a few sites .1 Therefore, the 
level	of	oestrogen	 fluctuation	 is	extremely	 important	
for the normal functioning of the systems/organs with 
oestrogen receptors.DOI Number: 10.5958/0973-5674.2019.00004.2

India is a land of cultural and social diversity 
along with co-existence of various religions. The social 
practices	of	Indian	diaspora	differ	not	only	with	religion,	
castes and beliefs, but also with geographical, economic 
and educational subdomains. The day to day activities of 
the	people	are	also	majorly	governed	by	the	part	of	the	
socio-cultural ecosystem that they belong to.
The	various	socio-cultural	 domains	have	different	
viewpoints regarding menstruation and the menstrual 
blood. Many of them pose restrictions on the menstruating 
women.2	Majority	of	these	restrictions	 arise	from	the	
ignorance induced stigma attached to menstruation. This 
stigmatization has led to formulation of various myths 
and practices surrounding menstruating women. 
In many societies menstruation also encompasses an 
element of secrecy, where, although menarche may be 
celebrated as a developmental milestone, menstruation 
is regarded as something about which women should 
always be discreet .3 Such is the level of discretion, that 
various euphemisms are used to address it public, or 
many a times, even privately. There is no evident reason 
known for menstruation to be perceived as “impure” 
or menstruating women to be perceived as “unclean” 
but one of the theories endorsed by western medicine 
and science is that being male is considered “normal” 
and therefore the male body is ideal .3 This results in 
most women internalizing the idea that something 
is fundamentally wrong with their bodies. 3 This 
misinterpretation	 can	negatively	 affect	the	symptoms	
experienced during menstruation and have a negative 
effect	on	the	overall	body	image	of	the	woman.
There	is	a	belief	that	menstruation	 affects	the	
performance	 of	women,	by	making	it	difficult	to	
concentrate,	 displays	poor	judgement,	 lacks	physical	
coordination,	 exhibits	decreased	efficiency,	 and	performs	
less well at school or at work.3 
Despite	lacking	in	scientific	evidence,	subscribing	
to	such	belief	could	lead	to	a	restriction	 of	women’s	
opportunities in the workplace and as contributors to 
society in general, and this could be an important source 
of discrimination against women in society.3
The perception of menstruation that a young 
girl constructs, depends on— how she is introduced 
to menstruation, how people around her perceive 
menstruation and how aware she is about the physiology 
of menstruation. Hence this research proposes to study 
the Attitudes, Beliefs and Customs about menstruation 
in urban and rural Adolescent females.METHODOLOGY
This cross-sectional study was conducted on 300 
subjects	in	the	age	group	of	10-19	years.		Descriptive	
survey	research	design	was	adopted	for	the	study.Written	
informed	consent	was	taken	from	all	study	subjects.	
Ethics Clearance for the research was taken from the 
Institutional Research Committee of The D.Y . Patil 
University by submitting a written detailed methodology. 
The	study	subjects	comprised	 of	a	convenient	 sample	
of 300 adolescent girls, equally distributed over the 
rural	belt	of	Khopoli	and	urban	section	of	Mumbai,	
Maharashtra, with urban to rural ratio of 1:1.
As	per	the	Review	of	Literature,	 a	detailed	
questionnaire was drafted and it was validated by 2 
experts. A pilot study was conducted and appropriate 
modifications	 were	made	as	per	the	suggestions	 from	the	
results of the pilot study.
DATA ANALYSIS, REPRESENTATION &

girls. Only 4% girls from the rural population could 
communicate freely with their fathers in comparison to 
19% urban girls.DISCUSSION
The Attitudes, Beliefs and Customs about 
menstruation in urban and rural Adolescent females were 
studied in this research through a survey based study.
This study throws light on various factors that could 
influence	the	perception	 of	menstruation	 in	a	young	
     20      Indian Journal of Physiotherapy and Occupational Therapy, January-March 2019, Vol.13, No. 1
girl’s	life,	which	could	in	turn	influence	her	transition	to	
womanhood	 and	also	have	an	influence	on	the	variety	of	
symptoms that she experiences, related to menstruation, 
during the course of time.
It was found that the girls residing in urban areas got 
their menarche sooner than the girls residing in the rural 
areas, which is dependent on the interaction between 
genetic and environmental factors and corroborates with 
previous evidence in literature 4-6.
The educational status of the parents residing in the 
urban areas was better as compared to those residing 
in the rural areas. However, the educational status of 
the parent was not always indicative of the level of 
awareness about matters relating to menstruation.
Level of preparedness: It was observed that 12% 
of girls from the urban population and 16% from the 
rural population were not prepared for the menstrual 
cycle and had no prior knowledge about it. This lack of 
preparedness could come as a shock to the young girls as 
she could think of the menstrual blood to be pathological 
and could perceive menstruation as a disease in itself. It 
can also lead to the lack of openness about the problems 
faced by the girls regarding their monthly cycle, which 
could be a potential health hazard.
Etiology of menstruation:  5% of the girls from the urban 
population and 7% of the girls from the rural population 
thought that menstruation is caused due to curse of 
God.	This	could	be	because	of	the	scriptures	of	various	
religions shedding light on the cause of menstruation 2. It 
can further perpetuate the myth of menstrual blood being 
‘impure’.	This	can	also	be	the	cause	of	formulation	 of	
various myths in the society about menstruation 2,3.
61% rural girls and 47% urban girls believe the reason 
for	the	monthly	discharge	of	the	blood	from	a	woman’s	
body	is	the	removal	of	‘impure	blood’.	This	is	alarming	
scenario considering 16% rural population and 12% 
urban	population	 wasn’t	prepared	for	menstruation.	 This	
could mean that the source from which the girls got their 
knowledge about menstruation was not completely reliable.
As observed from the study, mothers were the 
primary source of knowledge about menstruation. 
Therefore,	 for	the	majority	of	the	girls,	their	mothers	are	
the link that could help them perceive menstruation as 
either a curse or a boon— a boon that is involved in the 
creation of life and is therefore extremely important in the continuation of the human race and maintenance of a 
normal healthy body in females.
Behaviour during menstruation: 44% rural girls and 
25% urban girls kept menstruation a secret and 44% 
rural girls and 19% urban girls were embarrassed by 
it. The cause of the secrecy and embarrassment could 
be because of them viewing menstrual blood as impure 
and thereby feeling that they themselves as a whole, are 
impure. 13% rural girls and 12% urban girls also felt that 
the	people’s	behaviour	 around	them	changed	negatively	
when they were menstruating. This could further promote 
their belief that menstruation something to be ashamed 
of rather of thinking of it to be physiological. This 
could lead to them being reluctant in performing certain 
activities,	specifically	 during	that	time	of	month,	which	
could	have	a	negative	impact	on	their	self-confidence,	
self-esteem and growth over the years.
Systemic symptoms experienced before and during 
menstruation: The most common symptoms experienced 
by the girls during their menses included stomach pain, 
low back pain, breast tenderness, abdominal bloating, 
mood disturbance, nausea 11. Premenstrual syndrome is 
significantly	 associated	 with	increase	of	BMI,	sedentary	
life style, exposure to passive smoking, positive family 
history	of	PMS,	excessive	coffee	drinking,	and	frequent	
consumption of fast food 10 which are more suggestive 
of	an	urban	lifestyle,	corroborating	 with	our	finding,	
that the urban girls had greater prevalence of the pre-
menstrual symptoms as compared to rural girls.
Absenteeism from school: 39% urban girls and 9% 
rural girls missed school because of intolerable stomach 
pain and back pain. 27% urban girls and 22% rural girls 
missed their school because of weakness in their body.  
Common myths: The most common myths observed in 
both	the	sections	were	that	the	menstruating	 girl	shouldn’t	
wear	new	clothes,	touch	particular	objects,	enter	temples,	
and attend social functions. These myths were more 
prevalent in the rural areas than in the urban areas.
Nevertheless a relatively high prevalence of these 
myths in urban areas prove that the low socio-economic 
status	or	higher	illiteracy	rates	can’t	be	solely	account	
for the existence of such myths.
Lack of support system: 92% rural and 75% urban girls 
found	it	difficult	to	discuss	personal	matters	like	those	
related to menstruation with their teachers and fathers. 
Indian Journal of Physiotherapy and Occupational Therapy, January-March 2019, Vol.13, No. 1          21      
Despite having primary sex education as a part of their 
curriculum, many girls were uncomfortable discussing 
matters related to menstruation with their teachers.
Even though 90% rural girls and 91% urban girls 
found it easy to discuss matters related to menstruation 
only with their mothers. Therefore, we postulate that a 
large number of girls lack the support system that they 
might be in need of to accept this natural phenomenon 
that is, clearly, looked down upon by many in the society. 
The penetration of mass media across the masses is much 
more in urban population in comparison to the rural 
population. The presence of relatively more numbers 
of educated and working mothers have helped to boost 
the	confidence	 of	the	daughters	to	accept	themselves	 as	
equal and important parts of the society.
Level of physical activity: During their menses, the 
number of girls who performed any form pf physical 
activity dropped to 19% for 2-3 days/week and 4% for 
4-7 days/week.
The drop in this level of physical activity could 
be multi factorial. 25% urban girls and 13% rural girls 
experienced fatigue during their menses, which could 
be one of the factors. As mentioned earlier, 44% rural 
girls and 25% urban girls liked to keep menstruation a 
secret, and 44% rural girls and 19% urban girls were 
embarrassed	 by	it.	This	could’ve	led	to	them	refraining	
from practicing certain activities. The girls could have 
also thought that they should refrain themselves from 
performing physical activities while menstruating as 
they	wouldn’t	have	known	about	the	normal	physiology	
about menstruation.
Changes in the physical appearance of the body: 38%	
rural girls and 27% urban girls had negative feelings 
about the changes in the shape and size of their breasts. 
These changes in the body are most often physiological 
in nature and negative feelings towards them implies that 
the girls were not completely aware of the importance of 
their menstrual cycle.
CONCLUSION
We	have	found	in	our	study	that	menstruation	 is	
attached to a lot of stigmatisation which is carried on 
for generations at end is nurtured further by ignorance 
of common people about menstruation and its role in 
normal female physiology.Our study also shows that this ignorance seen in the 
study population is irrespective of the educational status 
of	the	subjects.	However	there	is	a	clear	demarcation	 in	
knowledge about menstruation in   the urban versus the 
rural population.
RECOMMENDATIONS
The communication gap between the parents and 
the daughters and the teachers and the student should be 
avoided as this may lead to formation of various wrong 
notions. The seminars related to menstruation should not 
only be restricted to girls, but also to the boys as they are 
the other half of the society; and the society as a whole, 
should be comfortable with the concept of menstruation 
as a whole.

ABSTRACT
Background:  Stroke is a dominant root of functional disability and altered quality of life among the people 
residing in the developed countries. Now days, Constraint induced movement therapy (CIMT) and Bimanual 
Task	training	(BMT)	has	emerged	as	optimal	motor	care	for	stroke	population.	 Although,	 the	efficacy	of	
these	two	regimens	were	analyzed	in	pediatrics	 population,	 evidence	stating	its	effectiveness	 in	adults	is	
lacking,	which	warrants	further	research.	Hence,	the	purpose	of	this	study	was	to	compare	the	effect	of	
constraint induced movement therapy to bimanual task related training for stroke patients.
Method:	30	subjects	in	the	age	group	of	50-65	years,	diagnosed	as	stroke	with	paresis	of	dominant	arm	(Grade	
4	on	Brunstorm	 ),	were	randomized	 in	two	groups.	15	subjects	were	subjected	to	CIMT	while	the	remaining	15	
subjects	were	given	bimanual	task	training	to	improve	motor	hand	function.	The	outcome	of	interest	included	
were	Action	Research	Arm	Test	(ARAT)	and	Nine	peg	hole	test	(NHPT).	CIMT	was	administered	 3	hours,	five	
times	a	week,	for	4	weeks.	BMT 	was	provided	1	hour	five	times	a	week,	for	four	weeks.
Results:	On	unpaired	t-test,	both	the	groups	were	found	to	be	significant	 at	p<0.01.		However,	 there	is	
significant	change	with	 ARAT	and	NHPT 	for	CIMT	than	BMT 	AT	p<0.01
Conclusion:  Constraint induced movement therapy appears to be optimal treatment options for improving 
the	motor	hand	function	in	subjects	with	stroke

Stroke	is	a	major	cause	of	functional	 disabilities	 and	
decrease in quality of life of people living in industrialized 
countries. Reduced upper limb function impacts on ability 
to perform activities of daily living, which is likely to 
reduce independence and increase burden of care due 
to hemiparesis following the stroke.1 Despite millions 
of dollars being spent annually for stroke rehabilitation, 
evidence	that	supports	the	efficacy	of	stroke	motor	
rehabilitation is limited, making interventions that reduce 
the impact of hemiparesis a priority.2Many of these are traditional treatments that have 
focused	on	regaining	control	over	reflexive	movement	
patterns using muscle activation techniques. Recent 
innovations in technology have allowed non-invasive 
examination of brain physiology leading to new 
theories on recovery of movement control and new 
ways	to	measure	the	effects	of	therapeutic	 interventions.	
Rehabilitation scientists are revisiting old models of 
movement control, while a new understanding of human 
motor performance become available.3  Rehabilitation 
for patients is fundamentally a process of relearning how 
to move to carry out their needs successfully. Research 
in motor control and motor learning has only recently 
begun to make an impact on he practice on rehabilitation. 
Motor	learning	need	not	be	rigidly	defined	in	order	to	be	
effectively	studied.4
Extensive research showed that the chronic lack 
of use of the upper extremity induced in monkeys DOI Number: 10.5958/0973-5674.2019.00005.4 
     24      Indian Journal of Physiotherapy and Occupational Therapy, January-March 2019, Vol.13, No. 1
by unilateral sectioning of the dorsal cervical and 
upper thoracic spinal nerve roots (i.e.somatosensory 
deafferentation)	 could	be	reversed	several	months	to	
years later with a physical restraint applied to the contra 
lateral,	unaffected	arm.5
According to the theory of “learned non use”, 
repeated	disappointment	 in	attempts	to	use	the	affected	
arm in the acute and sub acute phases can lead to negative 
reinforcement	 of	the	use	of	the	affected	arm.	Although,	
motor function may gradually return as the combined result 
of spontaneous recovery and rehabilitation actual use often 
seems much less than potential use.6 Within	the	past	few	
years, however, an increasing number of stroke clinics 
in	industrialized	 nations	have	begun	to	offer	constraint	
induced movement therapy to treat chronic hemiparesis.7
It has been shown that CV A induced spasticity leads 
to	significant	 slowing	down	of	unimanual	 movements	
,	alteration	 of	multi	joint	co-	ordination,	 decrease	in	
smoothness and segmentation (multiple peak velocity) 
of reaching and grasping movements.8 Remarkably, most 
of the goal directed movements in form of bimanual 
task training in which humans engage emerge from the 
brilliantly orchestrated and co-ordinated actions of both 
hands.	This	co-ordinated	 behavior	appears	effortless	in	
most cases, suggesting that the masterful controller, the 
central nervous system (CNS) is constrained by a set of 
rules that naturally reduce this complex co-ordinated 
control problem.9
Now days, Constraint induced movement therapy 
(CIMT) and Bimanual Task training (BMT) has emerged 
as optimal motor care for stroke population. Although, 
the	efficacy	of	these	two	regimens	were	analyzed	in	
pediatrics	population,	 evidence	stating	its	effectiveness	
in adults is lacking, which warrants further research.
Hence, the purpose of this study was to compare 
the	effect	of	constraint	 induced	movement	 therapy	to	
bimanual task related training for stroke patients.
METHOD
A randomized clinical trial was conducted between 
August 2015 and August 2016 in an outpatient clinic 
in	MGM	Institute	of	Physiotherapy,	 Aurgangabad,	
Maharashtra,	 India.	Subjects	 were	referred	 by	
their healthcare providers as well as recruited via advertisements in local newspapers and health 
magazines. Individuals were included if they were 
between age group of 50 to 65 years, diagnosed as  stroke, 
either ischemic or hemorrhagic with paresis of an arm, 
and without cognitive impairment. Exclusion criteria 
included  any psychological disorder, any neurological 
disorder,  any recent or acute fracture of upper limb, and 
any recent upper limb surgery. 
Following screening for inclusion, all eligible 
patients completed a standardized questionnaire, which 
included information pertaining to patient demographics, 
symptom presentation including duration and mechanism, 
history of previous episodes, treatment, and employment 
status. Patients were randomly allocated into two 
groups.	15	subjects	were	subjected	to	CIMT	while	the	
remaining	 15	subjects	were	given	bimanual	task	training	
to improve motor hand function. BMT was provided 1 
hour	five	times	a	week,	for	four	weeks,	while	BMT	was	
provided	1	hour	five	times	a	week,	for	four	weeks.
Outcome Measures:  Outcome measures of Action 
research arm test (ARAT), and Nine Hole Peg test 
(NHPT) were captured at baseline, and 4 weeks. All 
outcome measures were assessed by an independent 
observer	who	was	blinded	to	the	patient’s	group	
assignment.
The	ARAT’s	is	a	19	item	measure	divided	into	4	
sub-tests (grasp, grip, pinch, and gross arm movement). 
Performance on each item is rated on a 4-point ordinal 
scale ranging from: 
3: Performs test normally
2: Completes test, but takes abnormally long or has 
great	difficulty
1: Performs test partially
0: Can perform no part of test
The maximum score on the ARTS is 57 points 
(possible range 0 to 57)
The Nine Hole Peg Test was conducted with the 
non	affected	arm	first.	Timing	was	performed	 with	a	
stopwatch and recorded in seconds. The stop watch was 
started	when	the	patient	touches	the	first	peg.	The	stop	
watch was stopped when the patient places the last peg 
in the container.

daily	activity	tasks	through	exclusive	 use	of	the	affected	
side. The treatment comprised of unimanual activities 
forcing	to	use	the	affected	arm.	The	intervention	 was	
delivered 4 hours a day, comprising CIMT for 3 hours, 
five	times	a	week,	for	4	weeks.
Functional bimanual task training was performed 
in	a	treatment	room	for	1	hour	five	times	a	week,	for	
four weeks. During this process, daily activities were 
performed	 with	an	emphasis	 on	using	both	affected	
and	unaffected	 upper	extremities	 simultaneously.	 The	
bimanual task training consisted of pouring water in a 
glass, fastening a button, putting on or removing a shirt, 
folding towels, and wiping windows.
DATA ANALYSIS
Statistical analysis including mean, standard 
deviation, and standard error were calculated for all 
measurements. Data analysis was performed with 
SPSS	version	20.0.	The	mean	differences	 with	SD	for	
outcome measures of Action research arm test (ARAT), 
and Nine Hole Peg test (NHPT) were calculated for time 
periods	of	baseline	–	4	weeks.	Student	t-test	was	used	
to	determine	 if	significant	 differences	 (p<0.05)	existed	
within and between groups for each outcome measure at 
each follow up period.
RESULTS
CIMT	Group	included	53.33	%	of	the	subjects	in	the	
age	group	of	51-60	years	while	26.66	%	of	the	subjects	were noticed in the age group of 51-60 Years for BMT 
group.	Out	of	15	subjects,	there	were	60	%	males	and	
40%	females	in	CIMT	Group		while	93.33	%	females	
and	6.66	%	males	in	Group	2	respectively.
Outcome measures for both groups displayed steady 
improvement	 from	onset	of	treatment	to	4	weeks.	Within	
group	and	between	group	significance	 differences	 was	
noted for Action research arm test (ARAT), and Nine 
Hole Peg test (NHPT) at p< 0.05 as displayed in table 
1, and table 2. Between-group analysis indicated that the 
CIMT	group	had	significantly	 better	outcome	scores	at	
all follow-up periods compared to those receiving BMT 
(p<0.05 for all measures).
Mean	ARAT	Score	was	significantly	 improved	
in	CIMT	Group	(30.73	±	1.478)	as	compared	 to	BMT	
group (24.73 ± 1.459) at p <0.05, as shown in table 1

DISCUSSION
The	findings	of	the	study	are	novel	as	till	date	no	
study has compared CIMT and BMT to improve the 
motor hand function in stroke patients. The results 
of	the	study	demonstrated	 that	there	was	significant	
improvement in patients who underwent CIMT than 
bimanual task training.
The result of this study correlates with one of the 
study	done	by	George	F.	Wittenberg	 et	al	(2009)	who	
revealed	that	CIMT	is	efficacious	 in	promoting	 motor	
function of the paretic upper limb of stroke patients. 10 
They	quoted	that	CIMT	as	the	first	well	defined	post	
stroke motor rehabilitation which may identify changes 
in brain function and structure that accompany gains in 
motor function of the paretic upper limb. They found 
that varying patterns of change in activation within the 
sensorimotor network after CIMT, as documented on 
functional	 neuroimaging	 studies.	Similarly,	Wolf	S	L	et	
al (2006) also noticed that CIMT produced statistically 
significant	 and	clinically	 relevant	improvements	 that	
persisted	for	at	least	a	year	in	subjects	with	stroke.11 
Stephen	J	Page	et	al.	(2004)	revealed	that	modified	CIMT	
may	be	efficacious	 method	of	improving	 function	and	
use	of	the	more	affected	arms	of	chronic	stroke	patients.3
We	also	notice	significant	 results	with	Bimaual	task	
training	on	upper	limb	recovery	in	subjects	with	stroke.	
Previous	study	done	by	Kjerstin	Torre	et	al.	(2011)	also	
mentioned that bimanual co ordination is optimized around 
this	period	of	recovery,	indicating	 a	possible	beneficial	
effect	of	bimanual	rehabilitation.12 Sleimen-Malkoun R 
et al. (2011) stated that Bimanual coordination emerges 
as	an	active,	task-specific	 assembling	 process	where	the	
limbs are constrained to act as a single unit by virtue of 
mutual coupling.1 They debated on two main assumptions: 
1) stroke-induced impairment of bimanual coordination 
might	be	anticipated/understood	 by	comparing,	 in	join	
protocols, changes in coupling strength and asymmetry 
of bimanual discrete movements observed in healthy 
people and those observed in stroke; 2) understanding/
predicting behavioral manifestations of decrease in bimanual coupling strength and/or increase in interlimb 
asymmetry might constitute an operational prerequisite 
to	adapt	therapy	and	better	target	training	at	the	specific	
needs of each patient.  They believed that these statements 
promote	bimanual	training	as	an	efficient	and	adequate	
tool to facilitate the paretic upper-limb recovery and to 
restore spontaneous bimanual synergies.
In this present study, we found CIMT group 
performed better than the BMT group on upper limb 
recovery	in	subjects	with	stroke.	Similar	results	has	
been noticed with the study conducted by Brunner IC 
et	al.	(2016)	who	mentioned	 that	modified	constraint-
induced	movement	 therapy	was	more	effective	than	
bimanual training in improving arm motor function.13 
Wearing	a	mitt	seems	unnecessary	 for	most	patients	in	
the	sub-acute	phase	post	stroke	when	focused	affected	
arm training is provided. Facchin conducted study to 
compare CIMT and BMT and concluded that grasping 
ability is responsive more to CIMT than BMT.14 A study 
conducted	 to	find	out	CIMT	effectiveness,	 concluded	
that	CIMT	was	more	effective	in	improving	 grasp	than	
the controlled group and also, grasp showing retention 
of	the	treatment	effect	at	6	month	follow-up.
The possible explanation for superiority of 
CIMT over BMT can be explained in terms of 
neurophysiological studies of cortical activity after 
repetitive task practice using the paretic upper extremity. 
Liepert	J	et	al.	(2000)	indicated	that	following	 CIMT	
there is a substantial increase in the amount of cerebral 
cortex representation of paretic hand muscles.15 A recent 
report by Dong Y et al. (2006) using serial functional 
magnetic resonance imaging and a precision grip task 
showed a linear reduction in ipsilateral (contralesional) 
M1 (motor cortex) activation and that the mid-point M1 
Laterality	Index	anticipated	 post-CIMT 	changes	in	time	
to	perform	the	 WMFT.16
Our study has several limitations. First, the 
investigation of essential aspects of CIMT, including the 
extent to which the intensive CIMT schedule of delivery 
can	be	altered	and	is	ultimately	 cost-effective,	 requires	
further exploration. Second , incomplete detailed 
information about the anatomical location of each stroke 
and lack of information regarding the extent and use of 
medications	 limit	our	ability	to	assess	the	influence	of	
these relevant variables on primary outcomes.

CONCLUSION
Among	patients	who	had	experienced	 a	first	stroke	
between 3 and 9 months prior, administration of CIMT 
resulted	in	statistically	 significant	 and	clinically	relevant	
improvements in paretic arm motor ability and use 
compared with participants receiving Bimanual Motor 
Task	Training.	 These	findings	suggest	that	further	
research exploring central nervous system changes that 
accompany the observed motor gains and research on 
alternate models of CIMT delivery are warranted.

ABSTRACT
Background: Reduced	Walking	velocity	and	Gait	asymmetry	 is	a	common	sequel	post	stroke,	which	leads	
to increased energy cost and fall risk.Backward walking has been promoted as optimal treatment strategy to 
restore	gait	pattern.	Hence,	the	purpose	of	this	study	was	to	find	out	the	efficacy	of	the	backward	walking	
training to improve the temporal and spatial components of gait parameters in stroke patients.
Method: 30	subjects	in	the	age	group	of	40-70	years,	diagnosed	 as	stroke	with	asymmetrical	 gait	pattern,	
were	randomized	 in	two	groups.15	 subjects	were	allocated	to	Conventional	 walking	while	the	remaining	
15	subjects	were	given	backward	walking	in	addition	to	conventional	 walking	to	improve	the	temporal	and	
spatial components of gait parameters. The outcomes of interest included were temporal and distance gait 
parameters. Both the groups were treated for 3 weeks.
Results: Backward	 walking	in	addition	to	the	conventional	 walking	exhibited	significant	 improvement	 with	
respect to the walking velocity, stride length, gait symmetry as compared to conventional walking group at 
p<0.01,on unpaired t-test.
Conclusion: 	Conventional	 walking	training	with	additional	 backward	walking	training	is	more	effective	in	
improving temporal and spatial components of gait parameters in stroke patients.

Stroke is the most common cause of disability among 
adults.Approximately 700,000 individuals each year; 
about	500,000	are	new	stroke	&	200,000	are	recurrent	
stroke.1 The	most	severely	affected	activities	are	the	
abilities to transfer, dress and walk.3-6 variety of focal 
deficits	including	changes	in	level	of	consciousness	 and	
impairment	 of	sensory,	motor,	cognitive,	 perceptual	 &	
language functions are common.7
The incidence of stroke is about 1.25 times greater 
for males than females. The incidence of stroke doubles 
in the decade after 65 years of age. Hemorrhagic stroke 
account for the largest number of death with mortality rates	of	37%	to	38%	while	Ischemic	stroke	have	a	
mortality	rate	of	only	8	to	12%.	Loss	of	consciousness	
at stroke onset, lesion size, persistent severe hemiplegia, 
multiple	neurological	 deficits	and	history	of	previous	
stroke are important predictors of mortality.7
Altered gait pattern has been reported is one of 
the	major	issue	following	 the	stroke.8,9The gait of the 
person with hemiplegia has been described as slow and 
asymmetric.10-12The diminished velocity of hemiplegic 
gait has been reported with limitation in cadence, stride 
length, and gait cycle.13,14This slow walking velocity has 
been	attributed	to	decreased	 joint	movement	 amplitude	
and step length , while inability to produce selective 
movement	 in	the	joints	of	the	LE	and	poor	balance.15,16 
Attempts to increase walking velocity by hemiplegic 
subjects	may	result	in	safety	issues	and	abnormal	gait	
pattern. Hence, structured walking pattern should be 
established to promote optimal gait of the stroke patients. 
Asymmetry is also common entity following 
stroke,characterized by asymmetry of timing in single DOI Number: 10.5958/0973-5674.2019.00006.6

limb	support	phase	on	affected	and	unaffected	 legs.11,17,18 
The asymmetrical gait pattern leads to increased energy 
cost and falls.19-21 Learning	to	walk	backwards	 correctly	
is advised to improve movement components required 
for walking forwards.22
Although diverse approaches are employed for 
gait training, backward walking outweighs than 
conventional walk in multiple manner.23,24 In contrast 
to conventional walking, backward walking appears to 
create	more	muscle	activity	in	proportion	 to	effort	than	
in forward walking.24,25 It also demands a greater oxygen 
consumption, metabolic and cardiorespiratory response 
26,27It	combines	hip	extension	 with	knee	flexion,	and	
useful for patients with hemiplegia with synergy pattern 
in lower extrimity.28
Although research on the motions of walking has 
been conducted actively but research on gait cycle and 
feet	contact	is	insufficient.	 Therefore,	 in	order	to	confirm	
the	additive	effect	of	backward	 walking	regimen	to	
conventional walking, well designed randomised 
controlled trial was needed.
Hence,	the	purpose	of	this	study	was	to	find	out	the	
efficacy	of	the	backward	walking	training	to	improve	the	
temporal and spatial components of gait parameters in 
stroke patients.
METHOD
A randomized clinical trial was conducted between 
August 2016 and August 2017 in an outpatient clinic 
in	MGM	Institute	of	Physiotherapy,	 Aurangabad,	
Maharashtra, India. Individuals were included if they 
had	first	cerebrovascular	 accidents,	 Unilateral	 motor	or	
sensory	deficits,	or	have	Lower	extremity	Brunnstrom	
motor recovery stage at 3 or 4, Ability to walk 11 m with 
or without a walking aid or orthosis. Exclusion criteria 
included any disability which disturbs gait training, 
orthopeadic	 and	other	gait-influencing	 diseases,	and	
Transient Ischeamic Attack.
Following screening for inclusion, all eligible 
patients completed a baseline examination by 
independent observer. Patients were randomly allocated 
into	two	groups.	Group	1(n=15)	underwent	 traditional	
walking	or	conventional	 walking	and	Group	2(n=15)	
underwent conventional walking with additional 
backward walking.All participants were seen 3 times a week for 4 
weeks for a total of 12 treatment sessions.
Outcome Measures:  Outcome	 measures	 of	Gait	
parameters ( temporal and spatial or distance parameters) 
were captured at baseline, and 4 weeks. All outcome 
measures were assessed by an independent observer 
who	was	blinded	to	the	patient’s	group	assignment.
The Temporal gait parameters  included were Single 
limb support, Double limb support, Stride  time, Step 
time,	Cadence,	Speed,	etc.	While	the	Spatial	or	Distance	
gait parameters  consisted of Stride length, Step length, 
Step width, etc.
Treatment: 	Subjects	in	first	group	were	instructed	 for	
conventional walk for 20 min and this training program 
mainly focused on gait training, strengthening, function 
&	mobility	activities.	Subjects	in	second	group	instructed	
for	additional	 backward	walk.	First,	the	subject	asked	to	
take a step backwards within parallel bars and therapist 
supports	him	or	her	with	the	unaffected	 hand	as	required.	
The	therapist	provides	assistance	 to	move	the	subject’s	
leg	in	the	correct	pattern;	preventing	 the	subjects	from	
moving	the	leg	back	in	full	extension.	 When	the	subject	
moves the leg back with the correct pattern, the therapist 
gradually reduces the amount of assistance. Secondly, as 
the movement components have been practiced and the 
subjects	were	taken	over	actively	with	only	slight	help,	
the therapist facilitated walking within parallel bars. 
Finally, the distance and speed of walking backward 
were progressively increased.
DATA ANALYSIS
Statistical analysis including mean, standard 
deviation, and standard error were calculated for all 
measurements. Data analysis was performed with 
SPSS	version	20.0.	The	mean	differences	 with	SD	for	
outcome measures of temporal and distance variables 
were	calculated	 for	time	periods	of	baseline	–	3	weeks.	
Student	t-test	was	used	to	determine	 if	significant	
differences	 (p<0.05)	existed	within	and	between	groups	
for each outcome measure at each follow up period.
RESULTS
The	mean	age	of	the	patient	sample	was	53.86	±	
9.92	for	Group	1	while	51.73	±	12.1	for	Group	2.	Out	of	
15	subjects,	there	were	53%	males	and	47%	females	in	
     30      Indian Journal of Physiotherapy and Occupational Therapy, January-March 2019, Vol.13, No. 1
Group	1	while	53%	females	and	47%	males	in	Group	2	
respectively.
Outcome measures for both groups displayed steady 
improvement from onset of treatment to 3 weeks.
In  this study , the initial gait speeds for group 1 
is 13.303±2.324 and for group 2 it is 13.294 ± 2.159 
whereas after backward walking training gait speeds for 
group	1	is	14.850±	1.741	and	for	group	2	it	is	15.8±1.428.	
The	group	2	achieved	a	mean	gait	speed	15.8±	1.428	
just	under	the	3	weeks	intervention.	 The	initial	cadence	
for group 1 is 43.333± 6.320 and for group 2 it is 
43.266±7.430 where as after backward walking training it	is	48.666±4.820	 for	group	1	and	52.266±3.575	 for	
group 2.
Within	group	and	between	group	significance	
differences	 was	noted	for	temporal	and	distance	variables	
at p< 0.05 as displayed in table 1, and table 2. Between-
group analysis indicated that the Additional Backward 
Walk	group	had	significantly	 better	outcome	scores	
at all follow-up periods compared to those receiving 
conventional walk (p<0.05 for all measures). The 
mean	cadence	and	speed	was	found	to	be	significantly	
improved	in	Group	2	as	compared	to	group	1	at	p<0.05	,	
as shown in graph 1 and 2.

DISCUSSION
The	findings	of	this	study	are	novel	as	till	date	
no	evidence	exists	stating	the	efficacy	of	these	two	
regimens in stroke patients. In the present study, walking related factors were compared between before and after 
backward walking in addition to conventional walking 
program. Based on this we found that backward walking 
training by stroke patients improved their walking ability. 
In particular, addition of backward walking training to 
Indian Journal of Physiotherapy and Occupational Therapy, January-March 2019, Vol.13, No. 1          31      
conventional walk improved the symmetry of walking 
more than the same training on the ground.
We	also	found	significant	 differences	 after	training	
in walking speed, cadence, stride length, step time, 
step	length,	proving	the	effectiveness	 of	backward	
walking training. The result of the present study is in 
accordance	 with	the	findings	of	Yang	et	al.	conducted	
backward walking training for 3 weeks (3 sessions 
per week, 30 min per session) in addition to walking 
training for stroke patients in their experimental group. 
Their	experimental	 group	showed	significant	 increases	
in walking speed and stride length, demonstrating the 
effectiveness	 of	backward	 walking	training	just	as	the	
present study did.29	Weng	et	al	studied	the	effect	of	
treadmill backward walking training for stroke patients. 
The experimental and control groups received the same 
training for 3 weeks (5 sessions per week, 60 min per 
session), except that the experimental group performed 
treadmill backward walking training for 30 min in 
each	60	min	training	session.	The	10	m	WMS	of	the	
experimental	 group	increased	 significantly	 more	than	
that of the control group.Thus, backward walking could 
become	a	beneficial	walking	training	method. 30
Winter	et.	al.31mentioned that backward walking 
appears to be a mirror image of forward walking. They 
reported that in order to produce the muscle activation 
pattern involved in forward walking the temporal 
cycling of the muscle contraction in backward walking 
is simply reversed. Increased feedback though the 
sensory receptors of the soles led to weight movement 
and support onto non-paretic and paretic sides in a 
proper and precise direction, as well as improvement in 
lower	limbs’	muscle	strength	and	motor	learning	ability	
and reduction in double limb support stance.This is a 
possible reason for the improve gait performance after 
additional backward walking training.
Dorian	R	K	et	al.	stated	that	BWT	appeared	to	be	
a feasible important addition to stroke rehabilitation, 
and	significantly	 improved	 the	forward	and	backward	
walking speed32	One	of	the	specific	goal	in	gait	training	
is the restoration of gait symmetry in order to regain 
a physiological gait pattern. The result of this study 
suggests that additional backward walking training may 
help to improve walking abilities in stroke patients. 
Backward walking appears to create more muscle 
activity	in	proportion	 to	effort	than	forward	walking.	
This suggests a greater level of energy expenditure in backward walking than in forward walking. Additionally, 
backward walking also demands a greater oxygen 
consumption, metabolic response and cardiorespiratory 
than forward walking. 
The present study demonstrated that the patients 
with	stroke	can	benefit	in	having	their	gait	symmetry	
improved from receiving additional backward walking 
training. Therefore it is suggested that backward walking 
training should be added to the conventional walking 
training for improving gait pattern.
Some	limitations	 were	identified	in	this	study.	First,	
the range of the participant choice was narrow and small. 
Thus,	further	research	is	needed	in	subjects	with	a	variety	
of ages, sex and disease. Second, this study only compared 
ground back walking in order to analyze general walking 
patterns. Additional research will provide customized 
therapeutic walking,and treadmill walking that can 
improve	insufficient	aspects	of	the	subjects.
CONCLUSION
This	study	confirmed	 that	Backward	 Walking	was	
effective	for	increasing	 temporal	and	distance	gait	
variables	in	subjects	with	stroke.	In	the	clinical	field,	
Backward	 Walking	exercise	will	be	able	to	be	provided	
to those who lack these three elements after analyzing 
gait	pattern	of	the	subjects.	Future	research	needs	an	
intervention by each gait element through systematic 
analysis of those with inappropriate gait pattern, using 
advanced gait evaluation equipment.

Swimming is as an ideal form of sport considering 
not	many	athletic	injuries	are	documented.	 Although,	 it	
seems because of frequent excessive and small wounds 
in	swimming	 result	in	injuries	such	as	swimmer’s	
shoulder	and	breaststroker’s	 knee.1 These occur because 
of frequent and harsh nature of training for competitive 
swimming.2 The prevalence of knee pain among 
swimmers especially in breaststroke swimmers is second 
to shoulder pain.3 An interesting fact is that 25% of all 
swimmers	 injuries	are	related	to	the	knee.4 The primary 
cause of swimmers knee is the breaststroke which is why 
it	is	also	called	as	Breaststroker’s	 knee.4 The breaststroke 
is one of the oldest and most traditional strokes in 
swimming. During this stroke, the body remains levelled at the surface of the water and the movement 
is done by the legs and feet together to propel forward 
in water.5 In this, leg whips out helping to increase the 
speed of body through water.4 Councilman stated that 
the knee pain could be due to the tension that arose in the 
surrounding tendons and ligaments and determined that 
site of knee pain was related to individual technique of 
the whip kick6, 7. During kicking phase of the technique, 
the tension increases causing the force to be generated 
on the inside of the knee and this eventually leads to 
problems	 of	the	medial	collateral	 ligament	(MCL).4 
Problems	associated	 with	swimmer’s	 knee	are	diffuse	
knee	pain,	inflamed	and/or	fatigued	connective	 tissue,	
swelling of the knee, a sharp pain when placing the knee 
under stress, tenderness at the medial facet of the patella, 
and long term breaststroke swimmers may show clinical 
evidence of patella osteoarthritis.4, 7
According to a biomechanist, core stability is an 
osteoligamentous complex existing below a threshold 
at which buckling will occur. Therefore, core stability 
can	be	defined	as	the	level	of	endurance	 or	strength	in	
particular muscle groups of lumbo-pelvic-hip complex8. 
Core stability is the ability of lumbo-pelvic-hip complex DOI Number: 10.5958/0973-5674.2019.00007.8 
Indian Journal of Physiotherapy and Occupational Therapy, January-March 2019, Vol.13, No. 1          35      
to prevent buckling of vertebral column and return it to 
equilibrium following perturbation.9 Since, “core” or 
“lumbo-pelvic-hip complex” is composed of lumbar 
vertebrae,	 pelvis,	hip	joints,	and	active	and	passive	
structures that either produce or restrict movement 
of these segments.8 Core stability is instantaneous; 
to maintain it, the involved anatomy must continually 
adopt to changing postures and loading conditions 
to ensure the integrity of the vertebral column and 
provide a stable base for movement of extremities. Both 
passive and active elements contribute to core stability. 
The contribution of passive elements results from the 
interaction of mechanical load on the body architecture 
and the compliance of soft tissue8. This is because active 
elements supports osteoligamentous lumbar spine, which 
becomes unstable under compressive loading of only 90 
newtons10. Therefore, active muscular components of 
this system are critically important. The active muscular 
elements of the core contribute to the stability of the 
system through three mechanisms: (1) intra-abdominal 
pressure, (2) compressive forces (axial load) and (3) hip 
and	trunk	muscle	stiffness.8 There is direct relationship 
between intra-abdominal pressure and core stability and 
also abdominal muscle inactivity. Therefore, increase in 
intra-abdominal pressure decreases compressive loading 
on spine during exertion. And which ultimately gives 
global	trunk	and	hip	stiffness11. Control is likely to be 
automatic because extended latency period of voluntary 
reaction time. Two automatic neuromuscular control 
are	–	1)	Anticipatory	 postural	alignment	 and	2)	muscle	
reflex	response.8 Before self-imposed movements of 
trunk	muscles,	anticipatory	 postural	adjustments	 works	
was observed in several studies.12, 13 The anticipatory 
postural	adjustments	 can	affect	the	location	of	centre	of	
gravity,	which	may	affect	balance	and	lower	extremity	
joint	forces	during	upright	tasks.14 Secondly, trunk 
muscle	reflexes,	which	are	mostly	automatic,	 also	stiffen	
trunk and this leads to perturbation which is innately 
tied to neuromuscular delay .because of this mechanism, 
individuals will have greater potential for core instability 
and greater risk for low back pain.15 It has been also 
reported that contribution of individuals muscles to core 
stability	is	>30%	of	overall	stability	of	the	lumbar	spine	
for a variety of loading conditions. Therefore, stability 
of lumbar spine totally depends on the activation of all 
trunk muscles rather than individual muscle with unique 
mechanical advantage. Large	superficial	 muscles	of	the	
hip and the trunk are architecturally best suited to produce 
movement	 and	increase	hip	and	trunk	stiffness	to	resist	the three dimensional external moments that are applied 
to the core during functional activities.8	The authors 
suggested that the relationship between knee and ankle 
moments totally depends on hip moment, to preserve 
forward component of the acceleration of the centre of 
masses during kick task. As a result, the authors gave a 
hypothesis that, a co-contraction of chief muscles of hip 
and trunk (core), in all planes results in intra-abdominal 
pressure	and	stiffens	lumbar	spine	which	ultimately	
causes low back pain. These results in pelvic cross 
syndrome or also called lower cross syndrome. These 
occur due to muscle imbalance when a muscle is in a 
shortened or tightened state for a long time, which gives 
weakening of muscles on the opposite side of the body. 
This	is	referred	as	the	“Automatic	 Reflex	Inhibition”	 by	
the brain. Consequently, this muscle strength imbalance 
leads to an exaggerated curve in the lower spine which 
in turn causes low back pain. Because the gluteals are 
weak, its function is compromised and other muscles 
such as the hamstrings and back muscles are recruited to 
assist them in performing daily activities. This leads to 
overuse and tightness of the hamstrings and back muscles 
which ultimately weaken the abdominals and further 
increases	the	curve	of	the	lower	spine.	Strength,	flexibity	
and range subsequently decrease, which contributes to 
degenerative changes and pain in the lower back and 
also causes knee pain mainly at the medial aspect16.

and hip internal rotation (performing for 30 sec with 
progression of 30 sec every week). This session was 
followed by 10 minutes cool down. This protocol was 
performed for 3 times a week for 3 consecutive weeks.STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Statistical analysis of the present study was done 
using manually as well as statistical package of SPSS 
version	21	for	statistical	measures.	 Data	from	subjects	
demographic details i.e. age, gender, BMI, age of 
onset of breaststroke swimming, years of Breaststroke 
Swimming etc. were analysed using t-test. Comparison 
between both the groups with respect to the outcome 
measures of lap time, visual analogue scale (V AS), 
strength using pressure biofeedback and functional 
index questionnaire was done by independent t-test and 
pre and post intervention comparison between the four 
outcome measures in both the groups was done by paired 
t-test. Probability values less than 0.05 were considered 
significant	 and	probability	 values	less	than	0.001	were	
considered	highly	significant.

for knee pain before and after the study. The particular 
scoring was used in the study by Bert M. Chesworth, 
Elsie	g.	Culham,	G.	Elizabeth	Tata	and	Malcolm	peat	
wherein	VAS	and	FIQ	was	scored	for	patellofemoral	
pain syndrome. There was a reduction in V AS and 
FIQ	scoring	in	both	the	groups	post	intervention,	 but	
no	reduction	 was	observed	in	VAS	and	FIQ	while	
comparing the values between both the groups. Thus 
concluding	 the	effect	of	conventional	 exercises	 and	
core stability exercises relived pain and improved daily 
activities of living. Core strength was measured pre and 
post intervention with the help of pressure biofeedback 
maintaining the pressure of 40mmHg. The measurement 
of core strength was compared pre and post intervention 
in	each	group	and	both	the	groups	showed	significant	
increase in strength of core muscles, also a comparison 
of the both groups pre intervention and post intervention 
was	done	and	the	difference	 between	pre	and	post	
intervention	 was	formulated,	 the	difference	 calculated	
was	observed	to	be	highly	significant	 in	both	the	groups,	
the cause for increase in core strength could be due to 
effect	of	exercises	which	strengths	core	muscles	and	
also because of reduction in knee pain that might have 
induced the changes in core strength.
In this study, a supervised conventional exercise 
regimen was designed and administrated to the 
participants of the study group A which consisted of 5 
moderate intensity exercises, x-crunch up (repeating 20 
reps	with	progression	 of	10	reps	each	week),	flutter	kicks	
(continuing for 30-60sec with progression of 30sec every 
week), towel slides (repeating 10 reps with progression 
of 10 reps each week), superman plank (repeating 5-10 
reps each side with progression of 10 reps each week) 
and reverse wood chop with stretch cords (repeating 
for 15-25 reps each side with progression of 10 reps 
each week). And to group B, a supervised 4 novel core DISCUSSION
It is claimed that knee pain at medial aspect 
in breaststroke swimmers is because of an overuse 
syndrome	 in	training	posses	pressure	on	knee	joint	of	
breaststroke	 swimmers	 through	pass	of	time	and	finally	
causes pain at medial aspect of knee. Comparing all 
outcome	measures	 showed	significant	 reduction	 in	
swimmer’s	 knee	after	3	weeks	of	intervention.	 In	this	
study, lap time was measured before and after the 
study with the help of stop watch, similarly this form 
of measuring lap time was done to analyse lap time in 
the	study	done	by	Will	G.	Hopkins	and	Judith	M.	Anson	
While	comparing	 the	values	within	the	group,	a	reduction	
in lap time was observed pre and post intervention. 
It was noted that group B (core stability exercises) 
was	significantly	 better	than	group	A	(conventional	
exercises). Conventional exercises are proved to be 
effective	in	reduction	 of	swimmer’s	 knee	and	the	
possible reason for the same could be while swimming, 
core	muscles	(especially	 oblique)	works	out.	Without	its	
stability,	risk	becomes	hideously	inefficient,	 particularly	
while	breathing.	This	study	was	done	by	Lesley	Paterson	
which	showed	marked	reduction	in	 swimmer’s	 knee.	As	
clearly depicted in the results, the study shows a more 
marked	reduction	in	swimmer’s	 knee	with	core	stability	
exercises as compared to conventional exercises. 
The possible reason for this could be that while doing 
exercises when the muscles gets contracted it activates 
actin n myosin, which ultimately strengthens the muscles 
which are been worked out. This core stability exercises 
strengthens the core ad also hip internal rotators and 
superior adductors (groin) so as applying less pressure 
on knee and thus core muscles helps to propel forward 
and	also	reduce	lap	time	which	is	more	effective	than	
conventional exercises. Visual analogue scale (V AS) 
and	functional	 index	questionnaire	 (FIQ)	was	taken	
     38      Indian Journal of Physiotherapy and Occupational Therapy, January-March 2019, Vol.13, No. 1
stability exercise regimen was administrated which 
consisted of, knee bent bunkie with adduction and hip 
internal rotation (hold for 30 seconds with progression 
of 30 sec every week), swiss ball (performing for 30-45 
sec with progression of 30 sec every week), pallof press 
with hip internal rotation (performing for 30 sec with 
progression of 30 sec every week) and ab wheel with 
ball squeeze and hip internal rotation (performing for 30 
sec with progression of 30 sec every week). The results 
showed	exemplary	 reduction	in	swimmer’s	 knee	in	both	
the groups. The similar study was done by Paterson on 
swimmers	 to	improve	strength	and	efficiency	 of	core	
muscles by giving sets of 5 conventional exercises and 
found that these exercises can be useful for all sports so 
as to have strong core strength and stability. In the same 
way,	a	study	was	done	by	Dr.	G.	John	Mullen	to	see	the	
effect	of	4	novel	breaststroke	 core	training	exercises	on	
breaststroke	 swimmers.	 The	results	found	to	be	effective	
if done continuously for at least 3 weeks and more. 
According to the above stated discussion, no study 
has been conducted wherein a comparison has been made 
between	the	effectiveness	 of	conventional	 exercises	v/s	
core	stability	exercises	to	reduce	swimmer’s	 knee	in	
breaststroke	 swimmers	 within	the	age	group	of	8-18	
years, thus taking into the consideration the statistical 
analysis of the study we can aptly conclude that both core 
stability exercises and conventional exercises reduces 
swimmer’s	 knee	but,	core	stability	exercises	 more	
significantly	 reduces	swimmers	 knee	than	compared	 to	
conventional exercises.
CONCLUSION
From this study we can conclude that both 
conventional exercises and core stability exercises 
significantly	 execute	a	reduction	in	swimmer’s	 knee	in	
breaststroke swimmers under the prescribed time frame, 
but amongst the two, core stability exercises show a 
more	significant	 reduction	 in	swimmer’s	 knee	than	
conventional exercises. Hence core stability exercises 
for	swimmer’s	 knee	can	be	used	to	effectively	 reduce	
swimmer’s	knee.

ABSTRACT
Background: Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a condition in which woman has an imbalance of 
female sex hormones. This may lead to changes in the menstrual cycle, cyst in the ovary, failure to conceive 
and other health problems. PCOS seems to run in families, too, so if someone in the family has it, they might 
be more likely to develop it. The Poly Cystic Ovaries Syndrome is considered to be most prevalent of all

INTRODUCTION
Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a condition 
in which woman has an imbalance of female sex 
hormones. This may lead to changes in the menstrual 
cycle, cyst in the ovary, failure to conceive and other 
health problems. It is a common health problem among 
teenagers	and	young	women.	It	affects	5%	to	10%	of	
women in their reproductive years. These problems 
cause infertility. Research has suggested that PCOS may 
be related to increased insulin production.1
 PCOS seems to run in families, too, so if someone 
in the family has it, they might be more likely to develop 
it. Although there is no cure for PCOS, there are several 
ways to treat and manage the condition. If a girl is overweight,	 Weight	loss	can	be	very	effective	in	lessening	
many of the health conditions associated with PCOS. 1 
Sometimes weight loss alone can restore hormone level 
to normal, causes many of the symptoms to disappear 
or become less severe. Healthy food habits and exercise 
helps to combat the weight gain. India has witnessed 
about 30% rise in PCOS cases in the last couple of years. 
Lack	of	knowledge	 and	lifestyle	changes	are	considered	
to	be	the	major	factor	leading	to	this	phenomenon.	 There	
is a need to increase awareness among women so as to 
avoid	major	cases	of	fertility	problems	in	the	future.		In	
more than 40% of cases, PCOS is associated with obesity, 
as well as impaired glucose tolerance, type II diabetes, 
and	the	metabolic	syndrome.	 While	the	pathophysiology	
of PCOS remains unclear, insulin resistance has been 
implicated	as	a	major	causative	factor.1DOI Number: 10.5958/0973-5674.2019.00008.X 
Indian Journal of Physiotherapy and Occupational Therapy, January-March 2019, Vol.13, No. 1          41      
The Poly Cystic Ovaries Syndrome is considered 
to be most prevalent of all endocrine disorders which 
women face. The symptoms typically associated with 
PCOS—amenorrhoea, oligomenorrhoea, hirsutism, 
obesity, subfertility, anovulation and acne—can lead to 
a	significant	 reduction	in	quality	of	life.	For	example,	
hirsutism has been shown to cause marked psychological 
stress and infertility issues can cause tensions within 
the family, altered self ‐perception, and problems at 
work. Despite this, a recent systematic review revealed 
that limited research had been carried out to assess the 
impact that the symptoms and associated treatments for 
PCOS have upon the quality of life of women with the 
condition. Health ‐Related	Quality	of	Life	(HRQoL)	is	a	
multi ‐dimensional, dynamic concept that encompasses 
physical, psychological and social aspects that are 
associated with a particular disease or its treatment.2This 
study	intended	to	find	out	the	Quality	of	life	in	young	
adults	suffering	from	PCOS.
METHODOLOGY
30 Diagnosed young adult females with diagnosed 
Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome aged 25-35 years were 
recruited	from	south	Delhi	in	the	study	to	find	out	the	quality of life. Females with diagnosis of depression, 
language	or	cognitive	 difficulties	 preventing	 reliable	
completion of the questionnaire, a chronic or acute 
illness	unrelated	to	PCOS	that	could	potentially	 affect	the	
participant’s	 quality	of	life,	Patients	who	were	pregnant	
or were having a medical or mental health crisis were also 
excluded from participation2.	All	the	participants	 filled	
up	the	self	administered	 PCOSQ.	PCOS	Questionnaire	
has	26	items	divided	into	5	domains:	emotions	(8	items),	
body hair (5 items), weight (5 items), infertility (4 
items), and menstrual problems (4 items). Each question 
is associated with a 7-point scale in which 7 represents 
optimal function and 1 represents the poorest Function.  
Each item was weighted equally and presents the results 
as the mean score per item for each of the domains. 
Thus, the results from a domain with 4 items and from 
a domain with 7 items were both expressed as a score 
from 1 to 72.
RESULTS
The	mean	score	for	each	item	was,	Emotions	 (8	
items) was 11.56 S.D. 2.31, Body Hair 7.9 SD 2.5, 
Weight	10	SD	3.25,	Infertility	10.3	SD	1.84,	Menstrual	
Problems	10.3	SD	1.8.

DISCUSSION
The results of the present study clearly show that all 
the	domains	of	PCOSQ	are	affected.	Successful	 treatment	
of PCOS that would reduce the burden of the symptoms 
and associated psychosocial stress should also have an 
important	 impact	on	woman’s	HRQL.	Therefore,	 the	
assessment	 of	HRQL	could	add	vital	information	 to	the	
evaluation	 of	treatment	 effectiveness	 in	clinical	trials	
in	PCOS.	The	PCOS	HRQL	questionnaire	 represents	 a	
new	measure	for	women	with	PCOS	and	includes	five	
domains: emotional, body hair, infertility, weight, and 
menstrual	 problems.	 Investigators	 can	use	the	PCOSQ	
in either self-administered or interviewer-administered 
formats.	The	mean	scale	scores	on	the	PCOSQ	reflect	
the negative impact PCOS can have upon the quality of 
life of women with the condition. The weight seems to 
be the biggest challenge in PCOS patients.
PCOS is clearly associated with depression and 
reduced	QoL.	This	has	important	 implications	 for	the	
treatment and management of PCOS. Treatment of 
depression, although important in its own right, will have 
a	positive	effect	on	the	medical	management	 of	PCOS.	
For example, depression reduces motivation yet good 
motivation is the key to compliance with medication and 
the dietary management of PCOS. In conclusion, this 
research	has	highlighted	 the	poor	health-related	 QoL	and	
high levels of psychological distress found in a woman 
with PCOS. Finally, the psychological health of women 
with PCOS should be reviewed regularly.
CONCLUSION
The	study	shows	that	PCOS	affects	the	Quality	of	
life and an early intervention should be started in view 
of well being of the patient.Conflict of Interest: 	NIL

INTRODUCTION
In	the	literature,	the	terms	“flexibility”	 and	“muscle	
length” are often used synonymously when referring to 
the ability of muscles to be lengthened to their end range. 
Flexibility	 refers	to	the	total	range	of	motion	of	a	joint	
or	group	of	joints.	The	structural	characteristics	 of	the	
joints	and	the	mechanical	 properties	 of	the	connective	
tissues	of	the	muscle	tendon	structures	 largely	affect	the	extent	of	movement	 around	a	given	joint.	The	
specificity	 of	movement	 that	a	person	performs	in	
regular physical activities and stretching methods often 
define	the	development	 and	improvement	 of	the	body’s	
range of motion. Muscles undergo adaptive shortening 
when maintained in a shortened position for a long time. 
Clinically it has been proposed that a muscle which 
does not undergo periodic lengthening will develop a 
decreased resting length and extensibility. A series of DOI Number: 10.5958/0973-5674.2019.00009.1 
     44      Indian Journal of Physiotherapy and Occupational Therapy, January-March 2019, Vol.13, No. 1
studies	have	been	done	in	the	field	of	methods	to	improve	
muscle	flexibility	 which	have	shown	contradicting	
results.	Stretching	 is	defined	as	“therapeutic	 maneuver	
used to increase extensibity of soft tissue, thereby 
improving	 flexibility	by	elongating	 structures	that	have	
adaptively shortened.”1 There are mainly two types of 
stretching technique: active and passive techniques.1 A 
proper	stretching	 program	is	key	to	improve	flexibility.	
There	are	many	studies	on	effectiveness	 of	passive	versus	
active stretching. Many researchers prove that active 
stretching	 is	more	beneficial	in	short	span	than	passive	
stretching.2	There	are	limited	studies	on	effectiveness	 of	
active stretching technique.
A	shortened	muscle	may	create	imbalance	 in	joints	
and	faulty	postural	alignment	that	may	lead	to	injury	and	
joint	dysfunction.		 A	lack	of	flexibility	in	the	hamstrings	
is	thought	to	spike	the	risk	of	hamstring	 injury.2 Indeed, 
research has suggested that athletes who have a history 
of	hamstring	 injury	have	significantly	 less	hamstring	
flexibility	compared	to	uninjured	fellow	athletes	and	are	
also	very	prone	to	the	recurrence	 of	hamstring	 injury.	
Thus there has been considerable interest that upgrade 
hamstring	 in	athletes.	The	stiff	and	short	hamstring	
muscle tendon unit may be a risk factor for low back 
pain and the development of patellar tendinopathy. 
As documented in several studies, incidence rates of 
hamstring strains range between 7.1% and 30% with 
relatively	high	recurrence	 rates	between	18%	and	34	
%.3 A tight hamstring causes increased patellofemoral 
compressive force, which may eventually lead to 
patellofemoral syndrome.4  
Stretching	 is	used	as	part	of	physical	fitness	
and rehabilitation programs because it is thought to 
positively	influence	performance	 and	injury	prevention.	
Numerous studies have been conducted to investigate 
the	effectiveness	 of	stretching.2 Regardless of the type 
of program; the goal of stretching is often to change the 
physical characteristics of connective tissue. Connective 
tissue is a viscoelastic structure capable of plastic and 
elastic changes. The viscous property of connective 
tissue allows it to go through a permanent change in 
structure. Elastic properties refer to the connective 
tissues	ability	to	regain	its	original	length.	When	an	
applied stretch to a connective tissue is removed, the 
elastic components recover their original length and the 
viscous components remain deformed. The amount of 
elastic and viscous deformation can vary considerably, depending on the amount of applied force and tissue 
temperature. Theoretically, stretching protocols produce 
deformational changes that lengthen the connective 
tissue	and	increase	joint	ROM.  
PNF uses the concept of muscle relaxation being 
fundamental to elongation of muscle tissue. In theory it is 
performed in a way that uses the proprioceptive abilities 
of	the	GTO	(Golgi	Tendon	Organ)	and	muscle	spindle	
to relax or inhibit the muscle in order to gain a more 
effective	stretch.	It	does	by	using	autogenic	 inhibition	
and	reciprocal	 inhibition.	 When	muscle	is	stretched	
and	the	subject	voluntarily	 performs	 an	isometric	
contraction,	 it	is	thought	that	the	Golgi	tendon	organ	
reflexively	 is	stimulated	 inhibiting	or	relaxing	the	muscle	
and thereby allowing the muscle to elongate. There are 
three stretching techniques included in PNF: Hold-
Relax (HR), Agonist Contraction (AC), Hold-Relax 
with Agonist Contraction (HR-AC). Some studies have 
shown that Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation 
(PNF) and Contract-Relax (CR) stretches may be 
most	effective.	But	there	are	very	limited	studies	that	
conclude	which	stretching	technique	is	more	effective	in	
improving	 hamstrings	 muscle	flexibility	so	this	study	is	
an	effort	to	find	out	either	HR	is	more	effective	or	AC	in	
healthy female individuals. 
 In Hold-Relax procedure, the range limiting muscle 
is	first	lengthened	 to	the	point	of	limitation	or	to	extent	
that	is	comfortable	 for	the	subject.	The	subject	then	
performs isometric contraction for 5 to 10 seconds 
followed by voluntary relaxation of the tight muscle. 
The limb is then passively moved into the new range 
as range limiting muscle is elongated and held for 20 
seconds. This can be repeated for 3-4 times.1
In	AC	stretching	 technique	 subject	isometrically	
contracts muscle that is opposite to range limiting muscle 
(antagonist-quadriceps) and then hold end range position 
at least for several seconds. The movement of the limb is 
independently	 controlled	 by	the	subject	and	is	deliberate	
and slow, not ballistic.1	The	AC	technique	 is	effective	
when	significant	 muscle	guarding	 restricts	muscle	
lengthening	 and	joint	movement	 and	less	effective	in	
reducing chronic contractures. This technique is also 
useful when a patient cannot generate a strong, pain free 
contraction of range limiting muscle, which must be 
done	during	the	HR	procedure.	 But	AC	is	less	effective	
if	subject	has	close	to	normal	flexibility.

The study was done at the Physiotherapy 
Department, for a period of one week. The sample size 
was	calculated	 to	be	15	in	each	group.	The	subjects	were	
randomly allotted to one of the groups using lottery 
method.	Subjects	of	each	group	received	the	following	
treatments:	 Group	A	-	30	seconds	of	HR	stretching	 for	
hamstrings muscle for 3 times per set for 5 days in a 
week,	Group	B	-	30	seconds	of	AC	stretching	for	3	times	
per set for 5 days in a week for hamstrings muscle.
Outcome Measures:  Flexibility of Hamstrings muscle 
in the form of Perceived level of hamstrings tightness 
score	scale	and	Active	Knee	Extension	(AKE)	angle	with	
hip	flexed	to	90	degrees	in	supine	was	recorded	using	
goniometer before and after the treatment protocol.
 1. Active Knee Extension Angle: 	Goniometric	
hamstring length via the knee angle was measured 
in	the	supine	position.	All	subjects	had	their	lumbar	
lordosis supported with a lumbar roll. The distal 
tip of the lateral malleolus was marked. Therapist 
1	placed	the	hip	into	flexion	until	the	femur	was	
perpendicular to the exam table. Therapist 2 then 
placed a goniometric lever over the femur and the 
other lever toward the marked lateral malleolus. 
Therapist	 1	then	extended	the	knee	until	firm	
end feel was achieved; the knee angle was then 
recorded.	The	ankle	was	relaxed	during	the	final	
knee angle measurements. (Fig. 1)

 2. Percieved Level of Hamstring Tightness Score 
Scale:
	 	0	=	no	perceived	level	of	tightness
	 	1	=	occasionally	feel	hamstring	are	tight
     46      Indian Journal of Physiotherapy and Occupational Therapy, January-March 2019, Vol.13, No. 1
	 	2	=	frequently	feel	hamstring	are	tight
	 	3	=	constantly	feel	hamstring	are	tight.
Stretching Protocol:  Stretching maneuvers and verbal 
commands were previously standardized with the 
researchers being involved in the study protocol. The 
participants were instructed on the maneuver before 
the	procedure.	 Position	of	subject	was	supine	with	
knee	extension	with	hip	flexion.	Subjects	of	group	
A underwent HR stretching and the stretching was 
performed by having the participant in supine position 
and left thigh stabilized by the researcher with the aid of 
a	towel.	The	researcher	 passively	flexed	the	participant’s	
right hip to 90 degrees and then extended knee up to his/ 
her pain threshold and position in which discomfort in 
the hamstrings was reported was marked as the starting 
position,	at	this	starting	point,	subject	was	asked	to	
perform isometric contraction of hamstring muscle 
and hold for 5-10sec. It was followed by voluntary 
relaxation of hamstrings muscle. The limb was then 
passively moved in new range as range limiting muscle 
was elongated.(Fig. 2)
Figure 2: Procedure of HR technique
Figure 3: Procedure of AC technique
Subject	of	group	B	underwent	 AC	stretching	and	in	
this	subject	was	asked	to	concentrically	 contracts	muscle	
opposite to range limiting muscle e.g. quadriceps and 
then hold end range position at least for 10 seconds. In 
this	study	subject	was	asked	to	keep	knee	into	slight	
flexion	position	then	extend	knee	at	end	range	so	there	
was reciprocal inhibition of hamstring muscle and 
relaxation of hamstring muscle was occurred. After that 
move	the	limb	actively	by	subject	up	to	new	length	of	
hamstring muscle. (Fig. 3)
FINDINGS
Various studies have been conducted in the past to 
assess	the	effects	of	various	interventions	 on	improving	
hamstrings	 flexibility.	 However	limited	studies	have	
been performed which evaluated that which stretching 
technique	 is	more	effective	to	improve	hamstrings	
muscle	flexibility.	 The	finding	of	this	study	is	Hold	
and	Relax	was	found	to	be	more	effective	in	improving	
the length of hamstrings muscle among healthy young 
female	subjects	when	compared	 to	Agonist	Contraction	
stretching technique.
RESULT
Post data were collected. For statistical analysis t-test was applied for comparison of within group and between 
group	differences	using	SPSS	14.

ABSTRACT
Background: Adhesive Capsulitis is most common in patients with Diabetes Mellitus. It limits the daily 
activities of the patient by causing pain around their shoulder and reducing range of motion (ROM) of their 
joints.	Therapeutic	 exercises	are	given	in	institution	 as	well	as	at	home	as	home	program.	But	there	are	
patients	who	are	unable	to	attend	clinic	regularly	due	to	low	economic	condition,	 lack	of	time,	jobs	and	
household	 chores.	The	purpose	of	this	study	is	to	assess	the	efficacy	of	supervised	 Occupational	 Therapy	
programme and home programme in patients of Adhesive Capsulitis with Diabetes Mellitus.
Methodology: 35	subjects	were	taken	and	assessed	at	the	beginning	 and	re-evaluated	 at	the	end	of	4	week	
rehabilitation program, using the following:
Shoulder pain and disability index (SPADI)
Universal	Goniometer	for	range	of	motion	of	shoulder
Occupational therapy evaluation performa 
Result:	Though	patients	of	both	the	groups	showed	no	significant	 difference	 in	mean	value	of	any	of	the	
variables	which	means	both	supervised	 OT	as	well	as	home	based	OT	are	equally	effective	in	bringing	the	
improvement	 in	adhesive	capsulitis	patients	in	terms	of	pain	and	ROM	but	the	mean	disability	score	of	subjects	
of	supervised	 OT	group	(12.32)	was	found	to	be	better	than	those	doing	exercises	at	home	(18.90)	which	means	
to have more improvement in shoulder disability, supervised OT is better than the home program.
Conclusion: The	findings	of	the	study	suggests	that	home	based	occupational	 therapy	program	is	as	effective	
as supervised occupational therapy program in institute for adhesive capsulitis patients with diabetes 
mellitus, but to have better improvement in shoulder disability supervised OT is better than home based 
exercise program.

Among the general musculoskeletal conditions, 
Adhesive Capsulitis is one of the most common 
conditions	 to	affect	the	general	population.	 Adhesive	
capsulitis	 is	reported	to	affect	2-5%	of	the	general	
population,[2] increasing to 19% with type 2 Diabetes 
and thyroid diseases.[3] The condition is most commonly 
reported between the ages of 40 and 65 years.[4] It occurs 
as	the	area	around	shoulder	joint	thickens	and	contracts.	
It sometimes also occur due to prolonged immobilisation 
of	shoulder	joint.DOI Number: 10.5958/0973-5674.2019.00010.8 
Indian Journal of Physiotherapy and Occupational Therapy, January-March 2019, Vol.13, No. 1          49      
Adhesive capsulitis limits the daily activities of 
the patient by causing pain around their shoulder and 
reducing	range	of	motion	(ROM)	of	their	joints.[5] 
Adhesive Capsulitis especially decreases the abduction, 
internal rotation and external rotation of the shoulder and 
the patient in the initial phase complains of limitation in 
their	activities	and	pain	in	the	shoulder	joints	(Hamdan	
et al. 2003). Based on the etiology Adhesive capsulitis 
can	be	classified	as	primary	and	secondary.	 Primary	
Adhesive Capsulitis is an idiopathic condition where 
the exact underlying cause is unknown.[6]Adhesive 
Capsulitis associated with a known underlying disorder 
is considered to be secondary.[7] The freezing phase is 
marked	by	a	gradual	onset	of	diffuse	shoulder	pain	lasting	
from	2-9	months.	The	stiffening	phase	is	characterised	
by progressive loss range of motion that may last up to 
1	year.	The	final,	thawing	phase	constitutes	 a	period	of	
gradual motion improvement. Once in this phase, the 
patient may require up to 9 months to regain a functional 
ROM. [8]	[9]	[10]	[11]
Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation (PNF) 
stretch is one of the various interventions used by 
occupational therapist to treat conditions of shoulder 
complex. PNF stretch is a technique commonly used in 
clinical environments to enhance both active and passive 
range of motion with the ultimate goal being to optimize 
motor performance and rehabilitation.[14] 
Rehabilitation program can be given under 
supervision of therapist in the center as well as home 
program. But there are patients who are unable to attend 
clinic regularly due to low economic condition, lack of 
time,	jobs	and	household	 chores.	This	study	is	being	
conducted	 to	assess	the	efficacy	of	institution	 based	as	
well as home program for patients of Adhesive Capsulitis 
with Diabetes Mellitus.
MATERIAL AND METHOD
Study Design:  A comparative Experimental Research 
Design
Subjects: A convenience sample of 35 patients were 
taken. Males and females of Adhesive Capsulitis with 
Diabetes Mellitus, with age group 40-60 were included. 
Those with history of any life threatening disease or 
history	of	any	musculoskeletal	 injury,	traumatic	injury	
or shoulder pain due to fracture or any other pathology 
in past 6 months were excluded. Procedure: Necessary permission was taken from 
head of rehabilitation department for data collection.
Subjects	were	informed	about	the	nature	of	the	study	
and consent form was taken. 35 patients of Adhesive 
Capsulitis with Diabetes Mellitus were taken after the 
fulfilment	of	exclusion	and	inclusion	criteria.	They	were	
divided into two groups, institution based supervised 
occupational therapy program and home based exercise 
program, randomly. There were 16 patients in supervised 
occupational therapy group and 19  in home based 
occupational therapy group. Each patient was assessed 
on OT evaluation performa, universal goniometry and 
Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI). Patients in 
Institution based supervised occupational therapy group 
came to the department 5 days a week 45 minutes each 
session for 4 continuous weeks.
Patients getting home based exercise programme 
were called for follow up at the end of two weeks and 
all the activities were graded. They were given home 
exercise program pamphlet with exercises, dosage and 
precautions explained in it. All 35 patients were re-
evaluated at the end of 4 week rehabilitation program 
on	the	same	scales	to	see	the	difference	in	the	dependent	
variables.
OUTCOME MEASURES/SCALES
Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI):  It is 
a self- administered questionnaire consisting of items 
grouped into pain and disability subscales. Rating is on 
visual analogue scale and the mean of the two subscales 
are combined to produce a total score ranging from 0 
(best) to 100 (worst). The SPADI was designed to 
measure the impact of shoulder pathology in terms of 
pain and disability for both current status and change 
over time. SPADI can be used as an outcome measure in 
Adhesive Capsulitis patients.8
Universal Goniometer for Range of Motion of 
Shoulder
It is the instrument most commonly used to measure 
joint	position	and	motion	in	the	clinical
Setting. Typically the design includes a body and 
two thin extensions called arms - a
Stationary arm and a moving arm. In this study a full 
circle goniometer has been Used.

DATA ANALYSIS
Master chart was prepared on the excel sheet 
taking	the	pre	and	post	values	of	the	different	variables	
of SPADI and ROM for both the groups. Paired t-test 
was used to compare the pre-test and post-test values 
of shoulder pain, shoulder disability and shoulder 
range of motion as measured on SPADI and Universal 
Goniometer	 respectively	 through	SPSS	software	17.0.	
Mean of age and gender of all 35 patients was taken. 
Mean, standard deviation and t-value for all the variables of SPADI (pain, disability and total SPADI score) and 
ROM	(flexion,	abduction,	 external	rotation	and	internal	
rotation) was taken for both the groups.
FINDINGS
Data was analyzed using paired t-test for both the 
groups and the t-value for pain score, disability score, 
total	SPADI	score,	flexion,	abduction,	 external	rotation	
and internal rotation of shoulder were respectively as 
shown	in	TABLE-1,	 TABLE-2,	 TABLE-3,	 TABLE-4,

internal rotation(1.016) and post internal rotation(.1672) 
suggests	results	to	be	non-significant	 for	both	groups,	
which	means	home	based	OT	program	is	as	effective	as	
supervised OT program for patients of adhesive capsulitis 
with	diabetes	mellitus.	But	t-value	of	pre	disability(.895) 	
and	post	disability(2.008)	 suggests	result	to	be	significant	
p<.05 for group 1, which means supervised OT program 
had	better	effect	on	shoulder	disability	 of	adhesive	
capsulitis with diabetes mellitus.
DISCUSSION
The	purpose	of	this	study	was	to	assess	the	efficacy	
of occupational therapy intervention in both home 
based program as well as supervised occupational 
therapy program in patients of Adhesive Capsulitis with 
Diabetes	Mellitus.	Total	35	subjects	were	taken	and	were	
divided into two groups randomly. They were given supervised occupational therapy program in institute and 
home based occupational therapy program respectively. 
Occupational therapy evaluation performa and shoulder 
Goniometry	 was	done	on	the	subjects.	Shoulder	pain	
and	disability	index	(SPADI)	was	filled	by	them	and	
scoring was done accordingly as it was suggested by 
Einar		Kristian	Tveita	et	al	in	2008	that	SPADI	can	be	
used as an outcome measure in patients with adhesive 
capsulitis.8	From	the	35	subjects	24	were	female	and	
11 were males. In group 1, there were 3 males and 13 
females	whereas	in	group	2,	there	were	8	males	and	11	
females.	Age	group	of	the	subjects	was	40-60	years	with	
the mean age 49.937 for group 1 and 49 for group 2.
The rehabilitation programme consisted active 
ROM, active assistive ROM, active stretching and 
strengthening	 exercises	of	shoulder	joint	as	well	as	
precautions	 for	the	care	of	affected	shoulder.	Sarah	Russell	
also conducted a blinded, randomized, controlled trial 
in 2013 assessing conservative management strategies 
for frozen shoulder.18The treatment for supervised 
OT group was given for 45 minutes per session for 5 
sessions a week. Home based OT group was also asked 
     52      Indian Journal of Physiotherapy and Occupational Therapy, January-March 2019, Vol.13, No. 1
to do the exercises for 5 days a week, once in a day. The 
rehabilitation program was run for 4 weeks for both the 
groups as it was concluded by Jurgel J et al in 2005 that a 
4 week rehabilitation program improved shoulder active 
range of motion in patients with frozen shoulder.21
The result of the present study suggests that home 
based	exercise	program	is	as	effective	as	supervised	
occupational therapy program given in institute for 
adhesive capsulitis patients with diabetes mellitus. 
Result is supported by the study of Rupali Sen et al 
in 2014 who did a comparative study on home-based 
exercise program Vs. institution based occupational 
therapy	in	 improving	hand	 skills	in	post	collies’	fracture	
and concluded that both home exercise program and 
institution based occupational therapy are equally 
important	 for	reducing	pain	and	stiffness	and	also	for	
increasing pain free ROM, muscle strength and hand 
skills	in	colles’	fractures.17 Though patients of both the 
groups	showed	no	significant	 difference	 in	mean	value	
of any of the variables which means both supervised 
OT	as	well	as	home	based	OT	are	equally	effective	in	
bringing the improvement in adhesive capsulitis patients 
in terms of pain and ROM but the mean disability score 
of	subjects	of	supervised	 OT	group	(12.32)	was	found	
to	be	better	than	those	doing	exercises	at	home	(18.90)	
which means to have more improvement in shoulder 
disability, supervised OT is better than the home 
program.	This	difference	 is	supported	 by	Sarah	Russell	
et al who, in 2013, found that hospital based exercise 
class can produce a rapid recovery from frozen shoulder 
and	is	more	effective	than	a	home	exercise	program.18
CONCLUSION
The	findings	of	the	study	suggests	that	there	is	
no	significant	 difference	 in	the	mean	value	of	pain	
and ROM of shoulder between two groups but the 
mean	disability	score	of	subjects	of	supervised	 OT	
group (12.32) was found to be better than those doing 
exercises	at	home	(18.90).	Thus	it	is	concluded	 that	
home	based	occupational	 therapy	program	is	as	effective	
as supervised occupational therapy program in institute 
for adhesive capsulitis patients with diabetes mellitus, 
but to have better improvement in shoulder disability 
supervised OT is better than home based exercise 
program.	 Thus	the	patients	who	cannot	afford	the	
regular hospital charges or live in remote areas with poor 
availability of rehabilitation services or due to any other significant	 reason	cannot	come	to	the	institute,	can	be	
given home based exercise program, with proper follow 
ups, for improvement in the symptoms.

ABSTRACT
Introduction: Foot pain is one of the presenting musculoskeletal  condition usually encounter by Physical 
therapists. It is also found that fashion trends led the choices of footwear especially among females and 
there’s	vast	range	of	versatility	in	female	footwear.
Objective: This study was conducted to determine the frequency of foot pain and its association with foot 
wear in young female DPT students.
Method: The cross-sectional survey design was used. A self-administered questionnaire was  distributed 
among	333	female	students	aged	18	to	25	years.	Data	forms	was	divided	and	distributed	 between	all	five	
years	of	DPT 	in	IPMR	and	Ojha	campus	of	Dow	University	of	Health	Science.
Results: More than half (56.6%) of the participants reported foot pain in past three months  using NIS 
(numeric intensity scale). 53.7% of the participants thought that this pain was associated with footwear. 
Among	footwear	choices	jogger’s	and	canvases	was	the	first	choice	followed	by	pumps	&	pointed	toe	box	
as second choice, 52.3% and 30.9% respectively. Statistically, there were found no association between foot 
pain and foot wear.
Conclusion:  The results of the study has shown that more than half of the participant  experienced foot pain 
disregarding	 the	fact	of	jogger’s	and	canvases	was	the	top	most	choice	of	participants.	 Therefore,	 there’s	
needing to create awareness regarding footwear choices that accommodates the foot biomechanically and 
ergonomically in correct position.
Keywords:  Foot pain, foot wear, Hallux valgus.

Foot pain is one of the common musculoskeletal 
conditions that is being treated by physical therapist 
[1} In a recent APMA (American Podiatric Medical 
Association) survey 51% of adults reported that they 
have restricted activities of daily livings due to foot pain, 
still they have little knowledge about podiatrist and they 
would rather seek primary care physician (PCP)[2].It is highly prevalent, as one in three people 
aged above 65 years experienced foot pain. [3][4][5][6]. 
Factor  may be responsible for producing foot pain 
like	increased	age,	gender,	ill-fitted	footwear,	obesity	
and chronic degenerative diseases[2]. A study held in 
Northwest	 Adelaide,	Australia	indicated	that	one	in	five	
people	over	age	18years	have	reported	foot	pain	with	
higher prevalence in females [7]. In Asian population, 
50 percent of young urban working women reported 
recurrent	nontraumatic	 foot	pain	and	68.4%	believed	
that the pain is associated with the footwear they wore 
at work [3].
The	popular	summertime	 Flip-flops	 tends	to	cause	
heel	pain	and	conditions	 like	overuse	injuries	of	muscle	
(tibialis	anterior)	and	toes	that	have	been	identified	by	
podiatrists [13].	Furthermore, 	walking	with	flip-flops	
resulted in shorter stride, decreased stance time, and DOI Number: 10.5958/0973-5674.2019.00011.X 
Indian Journal of Physiotherapy and Occupational Therapy, January-March 2019, Vol.13, No. 1          55      
smaller	ground	reaction	force	(GRF)	impulse,	and	larger	
ankle contact angle in comparison with running shoes 
among both gender [8].
It has also been evident that wearing high heels and 
shoes with pointed toe box to be associated with the 
development of corns, lesser toe deformity and hallux 
valgus (bunion) [10].
The shoe toe box (shape and volume) is also 
significant	 in	terms	of	producing	 ill-effects	 on	foot’s	
health like high heels. Decreased volume of toe box 
causes cramping of the toes that have been linked 
to	produce	foot	deformities,	 joint	pathologies	 and	
forefoot lesions [11]. Development of metatarsalgia, 
callus formation and a higher risk of ulceration under 
metatarsal heads have also been shown to be related 
with increased forefoot plantar pressure [9].	A	significant	
association of 43 percent has been found between the 
shoes with narrow toe box and hallux valgus (bunion 
formation) [9].
Occurrence of foot pain associated with the type of 
footwear has been observed in epidemiological data that 
suggests that people show ignorant behaviour towards 
footwear because they prefer to choose fashion trends 
over comfort and ease but later in life they eventually end 
up with developing deformity or pathologic conditions 
such as hallux valgus, pes planus, plantar fasciitis, 
calcaneal spur etc.
So, the purpose of this study was to determine the 
frequency of foot pain and its association with footwear 
among young female DPT students of Dow University 
of Health Sciences.
METHOD AND MATERIALS
Research Design:  A cross-sectional (self-administered) 
questionnaire survey design.
Study Settings:  The study settings included IPMR 
(DUHS)	and	Ojha	campus	(DUHS).
Exclusion Criteria 
 zAny congenital deformity
 zAny foot pathological or degenerative condition, 
fracture or sprain resulting in traumatic foot pain.
 zMale students.Inclusion Criteria:
 zyoung	female	DPT 	students	aged	18-	25years.
Duration of Study:
 zThe duration of the study was 3 months after 
approval of synopsis.
Sampling Technique:
 zNonprobability purposive sampling technique.
Sample Size:
 zA sample size of 333 was calculated through 
Open	Epi	version	3.0	with	a	frequency	 of	68.4%	
(participants with foot pain attributed the pain to 
footwear),	 confidence	 limits	of	5%,	data	effect	of	
1%	and	confidence	level	95%.
METHODOLOGY
Demographics
 zIncluded age, year of study, height, weight, and 
BMI.
Subjects
 zFemale	DPT 	students	aged	between	18-25	years.
Tools
 zThe tool used for the assessment of pain intensity 
was numeric intensity pain scale (NIS), which 
represented	 the	intensity	of	their	pain.	where	0=no	
pain,	5	=	moderate	pain	and	10=unbearable	pain.
 zThe scale of NIH (National Institute of Health) 
BMI	calculator	 was	used	with	categories	 defined	
as	underweight	 <	18.5,	normal	weight	18.5-24.9,	
overweight	25-29.9	and	obese	>	30	or	more.
Questionnaire
 zThe questionnaire was divided into 2 parts. The 
first	part	covered	questions	regarding	footwear	and	
second part contained questions regarding pain.
 zParticipants were asked to specify the type of 
footwear that they usually wear to university.
 zThey were also asked about the duration for which they 
continuously wore the shoe in a day. Other question 
included	subject’s	opinion	on	whether	they	think	that	
footwear	affects	their	body	image/appearance.
     56      Indian Journal of Physiotherapy and Occupational Therapy, January-March 2019, Vol.13, No. 1
 zThe second part of the questionnaire covered 
questions regarding foot pain. Participants were 
asked if they had experienced foot pain in the past 
3 months.
 zThe participants were asked about the location of 
pain which was divided into various parts of foot 
like the heel, medial side/arch of the foot, the sole 
of foot, base/ball of toes, toes of the foot, big toe or 
base of big toe.
 zThe participants were asked if they believed that 
their pain was associated with footwear and for the 
reasons they thought were behind this pain related 
to footwear.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Data was entered and analysed using IBM-SPSS 
version 23.0, count and percentages were reported for the 
baseline information of samples on age, BMI, year of study, 
type of footwear, duration for which shoes were worn 
continuously in a day, reason for choosing that footwear, 
pain experienced in past three months, and other associated 
factors that were linked with the type of footwear. Pearson 
chi-square	 test	was	applied	to	find	out	the	association 	
between the variables. Bar chart and pie chart are also used 
to give the graphical representation of the results. A p-value 
less	than	0.05	were	considered	significant.
RESULTS
333 samples participated in the study, where 52.9% 
aged more than twenty-one years old, 32.7% studying in 
fourth year and 35.4% samples were found underweight.

DISCUSSION
Foot pain is one of the common musculoskeletal 
condition that is being treated by Physical therapist [1]. 
To	our	knowledge,	 this	study	is	the	first	survey-based	study that has been conducted in Pakistan so far. Our 
targeted population was young female students with the 
mean age more than twenty-one years (52.9%). The two 
main	aims	of	the	study;	first,	to	determine	 the	frequency	
of foot pain among young female DPT students of Dow 
Indian Journal of Physiotherapy and Occupational Therapy, January-March 2019, Vol.13, No. 1          59      
university health sciences. Second, the association 
between the foot pain and the footwear. Other variables 
were also measured which includes: BMI, type of 
footwear, duration, reason of footwear choices, intensity 
of pain, location and relieving measures.
In our study, we have found that 56.6 percent of the 
total participants have experienced foot pain in past three 
months and that our results are similar with a Singaporean 
study in which half (50%) of the participants complained 
the non-traumatic foot pain at least once a month [3]. 53.7 
percent of the participants in our study also felt that this 
pain	is	associated	 with	footwear	and	flatness	might	be	
the most frequent cause of pain. More than half of the 
participants (59.3%) described their pain of moderate 
intensity on NIS ---(numeric intensity scale).
In previous studies, the shape of the shoe toe box 
is	seen	to	be	found	significantly	 influential	 on	foot’s	
biomechanics and hence found to be producing foot 
pain	and	joint	deformity	[11], [12] as with pointed- narrow 
toe box [13]. In our study, it is shown that 30.9% of the 
participants used to wear pumps and pointed toe box 
which also the second most common footwear choice 
made by young female students.
There is found a strong link between footwear 
choices and the body image or appearance as 70.3 
percent	of	the	participants	 thought	that	footwear	affects	
their overall body image. It has been shown previously 
that fashion trends and styles are the main components 
of	choosing	any	type	of	footwear	rather	than	foot’s	
health [8]. In contrast, only 17% participant chooses 
the footwear of fashion trends in our study. One of the 
interesting	 findings	of	this	study	was	that	86.5	percent	
of the participants choose their footwear because of 
comfort and support yet, more than half of the sample 
reported the foot pain which is of moderate intensity 
(59.3%) on most of the day (26.6%) and heel, being the 
most	frequent	location	of	pain	to	occur	(48.4%).
However, there is no association found in our 
study between the footwear and foot pain statistically. 
Foot health is the area of least concern of an individual 
when it comes to health problems as only 2 in 10 US 
adults give a thought regarding foot health [1]. Therefore, 
the data available is limited enough to correlate the 
potential	adverse	effects	of	ill-fitted	footwear	and	the	
corresponding foot pathologies. Further studies need to 
be conducted to give the vivid relation between footwear 
and associated problems.CONCLUSION
It is evidently proven that diverse types of footwear 
impacts	differently	 on	foot’s	health	and	the	prevalence	
of foot pain is increased comparatively from past years. 
It may be associated to higher variation among footwear 
designs and style. It is also observed that fashion trends and 
overall	body	appearance	 have	great	significance	 in	making	
choices	of	purchasing	 footwear.	There’s	a	need	to	create	
awareness among general population to make appropriate 
footwear	choices	that	fit	in	properly	and	accommodate 	
biomechanically and footwear designers also need to 
produce shoes which are ergonomically correct.

INTRODUCTION
From early childhood it is necessary to produce 
enough grip force to manage independently every day 
tasks	such	as	eating	and	playing.	Grip	strength	is	important	
as a measure of general health and is often estimated in 
screening of normal motor function. It is also regarded as 
one of the most reliable clinical methods for estimation of 
strength and is used extensively on adults (1)
A literature review published several years ago 
intimated that Dynamometrically measured grip strength 
may have value as a predictor of important outcomes [2].
Instrument test can provide quantitative value to which 
a	patient’s	performance	 can	be	compared,	 but	most	such	
tests	cannot	be	conducted	 efficiently	 in	diverse	setting.	
Hand-held Dynamometer is an exception in the hands of 
a tester with adequate strength and skills (, 3].
An estimation of grip strength is made to identify the 
level of development and degree of disability. It is also 
used for treatment planning and evaluation. One problem 
is, however, a lack of relevant developmental norms for the grip strength of children. There are few studies presenting 
data for grip strength in large groups of children and the 
most	recent	are	from	the	1980s,	providing	 data	from	
children in the USA [] and Australia [1)
The instrument has been found to have good 
reliability in healthy adults [3]It is therefore essential to 
obtain an estimate of the average grip strength and the 
variations	 that	exist	in	children	of	different	ages	.	Full	
function and adequate strength of hand are necessary for 
dealing with demands of daily life. Hand grip strength 
is used in clinical settings as an indicator of overall 
physical strength and health [4]. Hand strength has been 
identified	 as	important	 factor	predicting	 disability	in	
musculoskeletal disease [5It even predicts complications 
and general morbidity after surgical interventions , 
general disability and future outcomes in older age.
The	jamar	Dynamometer	 has	been	found	to	give	the	
most accurate and acceptable measure of grip strength. 
Hand grip strength is positively correlated to height, 
weight, body mass index (BMI) and hand anthropometric 
measurements in healthy Indian man. [7]. DOI Number: 10.5958/0973-5674.2019.00012.1 
     62      Indian Journal of Physiotherapy and Occupational Therapy, January-March 2019, Vol.13, No. 1
Hand grip strength as measured by maximum 
voluntary contraction have a positive relationship with 
body weight height Body mass index and body surface 
area as investigated by various researcher in varied 
population of athletes, children and adolescents. A 
biological axiom of “Use it or lose it” applies to hand 
function [8]. 
The	power	of	grip	is	the	result	of	forceful	flexion	
of	all	fingers	joints	with	a	maximal	voluntary	force	that	
the	subject	is	able	to	exert	under	normal	bio	kinetic	
conditions (Richards et al. 1996 and Bohannon 1997)
[8].The relationship between handgrip strength and a 
number	of	variables	included	morbidity	 (	klidjian	et	
al.	1980),mortality	 (Phillips	1986),the	 risk	of	falling	
(Wickham	 et	al.	1989),anthropometric	 traits	(Ross	and	
Rosblad	2002;	Malina	et	al.1987;Koley	 et	al.	2009),	a	
range of functional ability variables ( Hughes et al 1997; 
Hyatt	et	al.	1990)and	nutritional	 status	(Guo	et	al.	1996)	
have been reported [9].
Wellbeing	 and	proper	fitness	of	musculoskeletal	
system is one of the important factors to carry out daily 
activities, gripping and pulling strength is part of it. . The 
hand circumference had the strongest correlation with 
maximum grip strength in both males and females for 
right hand [10].	Hand	grip	strength	can	be	quantified	 by	
measuring the amount of static force that the hand can 
squeeze around a Dynamometer [11]
AIM OF THE STUDY
To	determine	 the	age	related	differences	 in	handgrip	
strength among healthy Indian male and female in the 
following	 age	groups	between	the	age	group	of	(6-18)
years	,	(18-30	)	years	and	(30-50	)	years.

PROCEDURE
The research work has been approved by the 
research committee of college of Applied Education 
health science The patient is demonstrated about the 
survey	study	and	informed	consent	form	are	filled	by	
subjects..Subject	 will	be	selected	according	 to	their	
inclusion and exclusion criteria.
The grip strength of both right and left hands was 
measured	 using	standard	adjustable	 Digital	handgrip.
Dynamometer at standing position with shoulder 
adduction and neutrally rotated elbow in full extension.
The Dynamometer was hold freely without support, 
not	touching	the	subject’s	trunk.
The	subjects	were	asked	to	put	maximum	 force	on	
hand grip strength testing. The Dynamometer thrice 
perform both sides of the hand. The maximum value was 
recorded	in	kilograms.	 All	subjects	were	tested	thrice	and	
the best of three attempts was recorded. Thirty seconds 
time interval was maintained between each handgrip 
strength testing
RESULT AND DATA ANALYSIS
Mean variation:
Variation among male and female strength
Graph 1:  It represents the handgrip strength of right 
hand variation is more in male rather than female and 
left handgrip variation is more in male. BMI is more in 
females than males.
Mean variation:
Strength Variation among male and femaleGraph 2:  It represents the handgrip strength variation 
of right and left hand is more in male rather than female 
and BMI is more in male than females
Mean variation:
Strength Variation among male and female
Graph 3:  It represents the handgrip strength variation of 
right and left hand is more in male rather than females.
According to the mean variation the age, body mass 
index and the handgrip of right and left hand are given in 
the table…it shows that handgrip strength of right hand 
is more in males of all age groups..The BMI is more in 
males	then	females	age	groups	of	(18-30)	(30-50)	years	
but BMI is more in females then males in the age group 
of	(6-18)years.
DISCUSSION
The	findings	of	the	present	study	follows	the	some	
direction	(graph	3)	highlighting	 a	highly	significant	
positive correlation between all the anthrometric 
variables measured and right and left hand grip strength 
both in male and female. it is reported that as a rule, 
handgrip strength in ( both right and left hand dominant) 
is stronger in male then female across all age groups ( 
Newman	et	al.	1984;	 mathiowetz 	et	al.	1986).Hand	 grip	
strength	is	a	physiological	 variable	that	is	affected	by	a	
number of factors including age, gender, and Body size.
The present study concluded that the mean variation 
among in all age groups the handgrip strength variation 
of left and right hand is more in male rather than females 
but	there	is	difference	in	BMI	that	more	in	females	rather	
than	males	in	the	age	group	of	(	18-	30	)	years.
The	total	number	of	subjects	in	our	study	300.	The	
mean	difference	 age	group	in	our	study	was	(6-18).
(18-30).(30-50).years.	 the	findings	of	the	present	study	
     64      Indian Journal of Physiotherapy and Occupational Therapy, January-March 2019, Vol.13, No. 1
indicated a gradual increment of both right and left hand 
grip	strength	from	6	to	18	years	in	male	(graph	1,3).	It	
was reported earlier that physical performance had a 
strong association with body strength, shape, size, from 
and structure of the hand. 
Assessment	 of	HGS	plays	a	cardinal	in	evaluating	
hand power and its relationships with age and with 
anthropometric measurements as height and weight 
are of great importance, so we conducted this study to 
correlate age, height and weight with hand grip strength 
and	we	found	age	to	be	inversely	significantly	 correlated	
with hand grip strength, which might be attributed to 
several factors as aging causes diminished sensation, 
muscle	fiber	change	in	type	and	contour	and	degeneration	
in central nervous system, diminished proprioception or 
decreased muscle power and recruitment abilities. 
Growth	hormones	 and	testosterone	 have	more	
effect	on	physical	body	and	performance	 of	boy	then	
girl though boys enter pubertal stage later than girls. 
Testosterone levels are one of the leading playing role 
in the variation of hand grip strength among male. It has 
been reported that when testosterone level is increased 
in man with low serum testosterone, an increase in hand 
grip strength is found. 
The handgrip strength test is a simple and economic 
test that gives practical information about muscle , nerves, 
bone,	or	joints	disorders.	Even	though	there	are	various	
methods and devices for measuring hand strength, this is 
usually done using a Dynamometer which is economical 
and easy to use. Hand Dynamometer is considered to 
be a reliable instrument in evaluating grip strength and 
is used widely in rehabilitation. women working in 
different	constructional	 sites	have	poor	nutritional	 status	
due to their lower socio-economic condition but they 
require more physical strength i. e. handgrip strength 
to	perform	their	daily	work	efficiently.	 Quite	naturally	
poor nutritional status fails to provide adequate handgrip 
strength	to	them	affecting	their	skills.
CONCLUSION
Descriptive statistics of height, weight ,BMI and 
hand grip strength of Indian males are shown in the table 
above in the result. According to the data we concluded 
that the handgrip strength of right hand of Indian males. 
(6-18	)	years,(18-30	 )	years	and	(30-50	)	years	is	more	
than	the	left	hand	in	all	age	groups.	But	mean	difference	increase in BMI of females rather than males in the age 
group	of	(18-30	)years.
Present study generated normative values of hand 
grip	according	to	gender	and	different	age	group	(6-18).
(18-30).(30-50).The	 gender	differences	 in	grip	strength	
was	statically	 significant	 with	higher	grip	strength	
found in males than females. Also, it was noted that grip 
strength greater in dominant hand non - dominant hand. 
There was an inverse relationship between age and grip 
strength.
Handgrip strength was measured using a standard 
adjustable	 handgrip	Dynamometer	 at	standing	position	
with shoulder adducted and neutrally rotated and elbow 
in	full	extension.	 The	findings	of	the	present	study	
indicated a gradual increment of both right and left 
handgrip	strength	from	(6-18)(18-30)(30-50)	 years	in	
males and female.

ABSTRACT
Lymphedema	 can	be	defined	as	an	abnormal	accumulation	 of	interstitial	 fluid	that	occurs	primarily	as	a	
consequence of malformation or acquired disruption of the lymphatic circulation system. Breast cancer-
related lymphedema refers to a swelling of the arm caused by damage to the axillary lymph drainage routes 
during	breast	cancer	treatment.	 Lymphedema	 is	one	of	the	predominant	 physical	sequelae,	and	it	has	an	
impact on the physical function of the shoulder; shoulder impairment is higher in patients with lymphedema 
than	in	patients	without	lymphedema.	 The	objective	of	this	paper	is	to	review	the	evidence	from	contemporary	
literature	to	see	the	effectiveness	 of	complete	decongestive	 therapy	and	pneumatic	 compression	 on	patients	
with breast cancer-related lymphedema. The aim of this paper is to comprehensively review the literature 
concerning this topic and summarize existing knowledge. From present study, it can be concluded that 
complete decongestive therapy, including manual lymphatic drainage, compression bandaging, exercise and 
skincare, improves shoulder mobility and overall quality of life and helps in reduction of lymphedema 
volume, pain, and heaviness. The use of pneumatic compression together with complete decongestive 
therapy	was	found	to	be	effective	in	increasing	 the	range	of	shoulder	joint	motion	but	further	studies	with	
larger	sample	sizes	are	needed	to	draw	more	reliable	conclusions	 regarding	the	effectiveness	 of	pneumatic	
compression.	 Furthermore,	 this	review	identifies	areas	for	further	research	and	makes	recommendations	 for	
clinical practice.

INTRODUCTION
More than 1.67 million women worldwide were 
estimated to be diagnosed with breast cancer in 2012, 
accounting for 25% of all diagnosed cancers in women.5 
Given	that	the	5-year	survival	rate	for	breast	cancer	is	
now 90%, experiencing breast cancer is ultimately about 
quality of life.6
Lymphedema	 remains	a	significant	 complication	
following breast cancer surgery when there is axillary lymph node intervention.7 Up to 40% of the women 
treated for breast cancer has lymphedema. Currently, 
there is no cure for this chronic condition. Even more 
distressing is that women who treated for breast cancer 
are facing a life-time risk of developing lymphedema.6 
Patients who present with lymphedema may experience 
pain and body image issues and are at increased risk 
for developing cellulitis.8	Lymphedema	 elicits	daily	
stress	and	negative	impact	on	breast	cancer	survivors’	
quality of life.6 Early detection of breast cancer-related 
lymphedema	 is	crucial	in	order	to	start	an	effective	non-
operative treatment program.9
Complete Decongestive Therapy (CDT) is a novel 
physiotherapeutic	 method	which	offers	promising	
results in managing lymphedema.10 It is accepted as the 
most	effective	therapy	in	lymphedema	 management,

Lymphedema	 Network	and	experts	in	this	area.11-14 CDT 
program consists of a combination of manual lymphatic 
drainage	 (MLD),	 compression	 bandaging/sleeve,	
exercise and skin care.11,12,15-20 
Pneumatic compression pumps are used to treat 
acute and chronic lymphedema in order to activate extra 
lymph	liquid	in	affected	area.	Generally,	 these	pumps	
work by applying regular pressure or various-degree 
pressure to an extremity.11
REVIEW OF LITERATURE
Sezgin	Ozcan,	et	al.	(2018)	did	a	research	on	
37 patients who underwent CDT-phase 1 program, 
including meticulous skin care, manual lymphatic 
drainage, remedial exercises, and compression bandages 
to	evaluate	the	effects	of	complex	decongestive	 therapy	
(CDT) on upper extremity functions, the severity of 
pain, and quality of life and also searched the impact 
of the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics 
on the improvement in upper extremity functions and 
concluded that CDT provides enhancement of upper 
extremity functions and quality of life and reduction 
in lymphedema volume, pain, and heaviness and the 
improvement in shoulder mobility.21 A systematic review 
done	by	Lasinski,	et	al.	(2012)22 and a prospective trail 
done by Mondry TE, et al. (2004)8 also concluded that 
CDT	is	effective	in	reducing	lymphedema	 and	success	in	
girth reduction contributes to less pain.
In a study done by Vignes S, et al. (2007) on 537 
patients with secondary arm lymphedema to evaluate 
long term management of breast cancer-related 
lymphedema after intensive decongestive physiotherapy. 
It was concluded that during maintenance phase after 
intensive decongestive physiotherapy, compliance to 
the use of elastic sleeve and low stretch bandage should 
be required to stabilize lymphedema volume.23 Another 
study done by Ostby, et al. (2017) on patient perceptions 
of barriers to self-management of breast cancer-related 
lymphedema concluded that one of the main barriers 
identified	 was	lack	of	education	 about	lymphedema	
treatment and risk reduction. In addition, more than 
half	defined	support	as	“prescriptions”	 and	“referrals”;	
therefore, it is unclear whether patients were exposed to 
support other than medical treatment.24
According	 to	some	studies	assessing	the	efficacy	of	
components of CDT, a randomized controlled trial done 
by	McNeely	ML,	et	al.	(2004)25 and a prospective study done	by	Johansson	 K,	et	al.	(1999)26 both suggested 
that	compression	 bandaging,	 with	or	without	MLD,	is	
an	effective	intervention	 in	reducing	arm	lymphedema	
volume.	The	findings	suggest	that	CB	on	its	own	should	
be considered as a primary treatment option in reducing 
arm	lymphedema	 volume.	Low	stretch	compression	
bandaging	 is	an	effective	treatment	 giving	volume	
reduction of slight or moderate arm lymphedema in 
women treated for breast cancer. Manual lymph drainage 
adds	a	positive	effect.
Szuba, et al. 2002 did a randomized, prospective 
study	of	a	role	for	adjunctive	 intermittent	 pneumatic	
compression entitled decongestive lymphatic therapy for 
patients with breast carcinoma-associated lymphedema 
and	concluded	 that	when	IPC	is	used	adjunctively 	
with	other,	established	 elements	of	DLT,	it	provides	an	
enhancement of the therapeutic response.27 Systemic 
reviews	done	by	Leal	NF,	et	al.	(2009)28 and Devoogdt 
N, et al. (2010)29 showed that pneumatic compression has 
demonstrated	 efficacy	when	used	with	CDT,	but	once	the	
treatment is interrupted lymphoedema volume increases.
According to study done by DiSipio T, et al. (2013) 
assessed the incidence of unilateral arm lymphoedema 
after breast cancer and explored the evidence available 
for	lymphoedema	 risk	factors.	Their	findings	suggest	that	
more	than	one	in	five	women	who	survive	breast	cancer	
will develop arm lymphoedema. A clear need exists for 
improved understanding of contributing risk factors, 
as well as of prevention and management strategies to 
reduce the individual and public health burden of this 
disabling and distressing disorder.30
Butt, et al. (2017) did a randomized controlled 
study	which	was	designed	to	evaluate	the	effectiveness	
of compression therapy and exercise in the treatment 
of lymphedema in 30 patients with breast cancer. 
And concluded that both the treatment techniques, 
compression bandage and compression bandage along 
with	exercise	are	effective	in	reducing	lymphedema	
and pain; but, clinically, compression bandage along 
with	exercise	is	more	effective.31 According to a study 
done	by	Ezzo	J,	et	al.	(2015)	to	assess	the	efficacy	and	
safety	of	MLD	in	treating	BCRL	included	randomized	
controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs of women with 
BCRL.	Concluded	 that	MLD	is	safe	and	may	offer	
additional	benefit	to	compression	 bandaging	 for	swelling	
reduction. Compared to individuals with moderate-to-
severe	BCRL,	those	with	mild-to-moderate	 BCRL	may	
     68      Indian Journal of Physiotherapy and Occupational Therapy, January-March 2019, Vol.13, No. 1
be	the	ones	who	benefit	from	adding	MLD	to	an	intensive	
course of treatment with compression bandaging.32
In a study done by Moattari, et al. (2012) to evaluate 
the	effect	of	combined	decongestive	 therapy	(CDT)	and	
pneumatic compression pump on lymphedema indicators 
in patients with breast cancer related lymphedema 
(BCRL)	concluded	 that	CDT	significantly	 reduced	
mean	volume	and	mean	circumference	 of	the	affected	
limb,	and	significantly	 increased	shoulder	joint	range	
of motion and the use of compression pump along with 
CDT	gives	more	desirable	effects.33	Whereas	in	a	study	
done by Uzkeser, et al. (2013) showed that the addition 
of IPC to the therapy may not provide any additional 
benefit	for	upper	extremity	impairments.1
S Randheer, et al. (2011) did a prospective study 
and found that CDT combined with long term self-
management	 is	effective	in	treating	post	mastectomy	
lymphedema.10	And	in	a	study	on	effect	of	CDT	and	
home	program	on	health	related	QOL	in	post	mastectomy	
patients done by Melam, et al. (2016), it was found that 
remedial exercises and home program in addition to 
MLD	and	CB	resulted	in	improved	QOL.	Incorporation	
of remedial exercises and a home program was found to 
be	effective	in	long	term	management	 of	lymphedema.34 
Some studies suggested advancements in the 
components of CDT, Ha, et al. (2017) concluded that 
the	combination	 of	MLD	and	PNF	induces	potent	
synergistic	 effects	on	edema	volume,	shoulder	range	
of motion (ROM), pain, and depression in patients 
with lymphedema. In addition, an increased rate of 
axillary	arterial	blood	flow	in	PNF-treated	 patients	
provide a potential physiological mechanism by which 
local	arterial	pulsation	in	the	affected	extremity	 plays	
a positive role in the treatment of lymphedema.35 And 
according to a case study done by Do Junghwa, et al. 
(2017), it was concluded that the use of an additional pad 
and	taping	on	a	large	edematous 	site	with	fibrotic	changes	
has demonstrated a positive result in lymphedema 
management for a post mastectomy patient.36
CONCLUSION
Based	on	sufficient	amount	of	evidence,	it	can	be	
concluded that use of complete decongestive therapy 
and	pneumatic	 compression	 is	effective	in	reducing	
edema, pain and in enhancing upper limb functions 
by facilitating the lymphatic system. CDT improves overall	quality	of	life	and	is	effective	for	various	
degrees of lymphedema: mild, moderate, or severe; 
early or late onset; recent or chronic; in patients with 
active cancer; and in palliative care situations. The 
use of pneumatic compression together with CDT was 
found	to	be	effective	in	increasing	 the	range	of	shoulder	
joint	motion,	but	when	used	individually	 pneumatic	
compression	 has	no	effect	on	lymphedema.	 Therefore,	
further controlled studies involving a larger number of 
patients over a longer period are needed to investigate 
the	effects	of	pneumatic	 compression	 on	functional	
limitations	 of	the	upper	limbs.	Lymphedema	 is	one	
of the most important factors that elicit daily stress in 
breast cancer survivors since there is no cure for this 
condition.	 Lifelong	adherence	to	prescribed	 treatment	
regimen is required to prevent progression of disease. 
Adherence to the prescribed management routine can 
be	difficult	because	even	the	most	customized	 garments	
or sleeves sometimes are uncomfortable, unsightly, and 
laborious to put on. A constellation of complex factors 
(e.g.,	physical,	financial,	aesthetic,	time)	can	influence	
survivors’	adherence	 with	management	 routines.	To	
reduce the risk of lymphedema and maintain optimal 
lymphedema management, patient self-care is ultimately 
necessary to promote lymph drainage and prevent 
inflammation	 infection.	 Optimal	self-care	typically	
includes adherence to risk reduction behaviours, optimal 
weight management, use of compression garments, 
exercises, healthy lifestyle practices, and seeking 
assistance for lymphedema-related problems.

ABSTRACT
Background: Acapella	is	responsible	 for	increasing	 the	efficiency	 to	remove	the	secretions,	 the	Flutter	
helps airway clearance by vibrating the airways to loosen mucous and Active cycle of breathing technique 
is useful for improving lung function.
Methodology: 	50	subjects	of	age	group	between	35-80	years,	were	screened	according	 to	GOLD	criteria	
having	MILD,	MODERATE	 and	SEVERE	CRITERIA,	 out	of	which	40	patients	were	under	inclusion	
criteria.	3	days	protocol	 was	given.	 Three	groups	for	treatments	 i.e	GROUP	A,	B	and	C;	ACBT,	FLUTTER	
and Acapella respectively were divided. Pre PFT was done on the 1st day and post PFT was on 3rd day. The 
pre and post values were compared.
Result:  The comparison was done between three groups and within the groups the p-value for FEV1 for 
(group	A)	p=	0.000,	(group	B)	p=0.004	and	(group	C)	p=0.002;	for	FVC	(group	A)	p=0.000,	(group	B)	
p=0.005	and(group	 C)	p=0.004	;	for	FEV1/FVC	(group	A)	p=0.98,	(group	B)	p=0.12	and	(group	C)p=0.38;	
for	PEFR	(group	A)	p=0.025,	(group	B)	p=0.007	and	(group	C)	p=0.025	and	for	MVC/FEF25-75% (group A) 
p=0.02,	(group	B)	p=0.04	and	(group	C)	p=	0.24	and	for	between	the	group,	the	p-value	for	FEV1 is 0.93 
for the three groups, for FVC is 0.49, for FEV1/FVC	is	0.78,	for	PEFR	is	0.71	and	for	MEFR	or	FEF25-75% is 
0.96.	Therefore,	it	was	not	statistically	significant	among	the	group.
Conclusion: 	Thus,	the	conclusion	 of	the	study	is	that	the	ACBT,	flutter	and	ACPELLA 	had	a	positive	effect	for	the	
condition	among	their	respective	group.	Between	the	groups,	there	was	no	treatment	more	effective	than	the	other.

INTRODUCTION
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) 
kills more than 3 million people every year, making it 
the 4th largest cause of death in the world [1]. COPD 
is	associated	 with	significant	 morbidity	 and	mortality	
worldwide and is currently a global health priority [2]. 
According	 to	crude	estimates,	 30	million	people	suffer	
with COPD in India, and these numbers are only 
going to increase in the forthcoming years [1]. Chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive 
inflammatory	 disease	of	the	lung	characterized	 by	
chronic bronchitis, airway thickening and emphysema 
[3]. The progression of COPD is associated with 
increasing frequency and severity of exacerbations [4]. 
COPD is characterised by	the	persistence	 inflammation	of the airways, lung parenchyma and its vasculature.
Expiratory	 flow	limitation	 is	the	pathophysiological	
hall	mark	of	the	COPD.	Expiratory	 flow	limitation	with	
dynamic collapse of the small airways comprises the 
ability of patient to expel air during expiration, resulting 
in	air	trapping	and	lung	hyperinflation	[5].
Pathologically,	 COPD	is	characterized	 by	diffuse	
inflammation	 of	lung	parenchyma	 and	airways.	The	
inflammatory	 response	in	emphysema	 typically	shows	
evidence of the activation of innate and acquired 
inflammatory	 processes.	 The	accumulation	 of	these	
components	 contributes	 to	the	lung	injury	in	these	patients	
and serves as a self-perpetuating stimulus for further 
immune	activation.	 The	mobilization	 of	inflammatory	
cells to the lung leads to the release of potentially DOI Number: 10.5958/0973-5674.2019.00014.5

destructive mediators, including tissue proteases 
and cytokines, which directly contribute to tissue 
remodeling and destruction. These mediators include 
chemoattractant factors, most notably chemokines, 
which	serve	to	attract	additional	inflammatory	cells [6],[7]
Stage I:  Mild FEV 1/FVC < 0.70
FEV 1 ≥	80%	predicted
Stage II:  Moderate FEV1/FVC < 0.70
50%	≤	FEV 1 <	80%	predicted
Stage III:  Severe FEV1/FVC < 0.70
30%	≤	FEV 1 < 50% predicted
Stage IV :  V ery Severe FEV1/FVC < 0.70
FEV1 < 30% predicted or FEV 1 < 50%  predicted plus 
chronic respiratory failure
Dyspnea, the hallmark symptom of COPD, is the 
reason most patients seek medical attention and is a 
major	cause	of	disability	and	anxiety	associated	 with	
the	disease.	Chronic	and	tenacious	cough	often	the	first	
symptom of COPD to develop by the patient as an expected 
consequence of smoking and/or environmental exposures. 
Wheezing	and	chest	tightness	are	nonspecific 	symptoms	
that	may	vary	between	days.	Weight	loss	and	anorexia	
are common problems in advanced COPD. Spirometry 
should be undertaken in all patients who may have 
COPD.	It	is	needed	to	make	a	confident	diagnosis	of	
COPD and to exclude other diagnoses that may present 
with similar symptoms. Spirometry should measure 
the volume of air forcibly exhaled from the point of 
maximal inspiration (forced vital capacity , FVC) and 
the	volume	of	air	exhaled	during	the	first	second	of	this	
manoeuvre (forced expiratory volume in one second, 
FEV1), and the ratio of these two measurements (FEV1/
FVC) should be calculated. Spirometry measurements 
are evaluated by comparison with reference values based 
on age, height, sex, and race (use appropriate reference 
values). The classes of medications commonly used 
in treating COPD are Fenoterol,  Salbutamol (albuterol), 
T erbutaline,  Ipratropium bromide,  Oxitropium bromide, 
Tiotropium,  Fenoterol/Ipratropium, Salbutamol/Ipratropium,  
Aminophylline,  Theophylline (SR), Beclomethasone, 
Budesonide, Fluticasone, Triamcinolone,  and Prednisone 
Methyl-prednisolone [8].
The active cycle of breathing technique (ACBT) and 
the forced expiratory technique (FET) are commonly used 
to promote airway clearance for individuals with chronic 
lung disease characterised by copious secretions[16]. Treatment methods that aim to clear secretions 
may decrease the frequency of infections, therefore 
preventing further airway damage and deterioration 
of lung function, and potentially reducing the rate of 
progression of lung disease. The FET consists of one or 
two	forced	expirations	 or	huffs,	followed	by	breathing	
control (relaxed breathing).The FET is an integral part 
of	the	ACBT,	in	conjunction	 with	thoracic	expansion	
exercises and interspersed periods of breathing control. 
A typical ACBT cycle therefore consists of breathing 
control, thoracic expansion exercises, breathing control, 
and	the	forced	expiratory	 technique	 (huffing).	 The	
number and frequency of each of the components of 
the ACBT can be altered, but all components of the 
cycle must be present, and interspersed with breathing 
control[9].
The Acapella is a newer device that in addition 
to generating a positive pressure has an oscillatory 
component, causing airway vibrations. These vibrations 
may	have	added	benefit	over	the	PEP	mask	in	helping	
to dislodge thick, sticky secretions from the airway 
walls. Airway oscillation may also decrease mucous 
viscoelasticity[14]. The Acapella, with its oscillatory 
function,	flexibility	 of	position	for	use,	and	the	option	
for measuring the pressures generated has the potential 
to be a useful tool in CF management [10].The Acapella 
is a small hand held device for airway clearance. It has 
both resistive and vibratory features, which help loosen 
and clear secretions from your chest.
Fig. 1: ACAPELLA DEVICE
The Flutter is a small handheld pipe-shaped 
device that has a hard plastic mouthpiece at one end, a 
perforated plastic cover at the other, and a stainless-steel 
ball resting in a plastic cone on the inside. It is portable 
and relatively inexpensive and can be used on its own[11]..

Spirometry is a physiological test that measures 
how an individual inhales or exhales volumes of air 
as a function of time. The primary signal measured 
in	spirometry	 may	be	volume	or	flow.	Spirometry	 is	
invaluable as a screening test of general respiratory 
health in the same way that blood pressure provides 
important information about general cardiovascular 
health. Spirometry can be undertaken with many 
different	types	of	equipment,	 and	requires	cooperation	
between	the	subject	and	the	examiner,	 and	the	results	
obtained will depend on technical as well as personal 
factors [12]. Inspired and expired lung volumes measured 
by Spirometry are useful for detecting, characterising 
and quantifying the severity of lung disease. [13]. The 
most common parameters measured in spirometry are 
Vital capacity (VC), Forced vital capacity (FVC), Forced 
expiratory volume (FEV) at timed intervals of 0.5, 1.0 
(FEV1),	2.0,	and	3.0	seconds,	forced	expiratory	 flow	
25–75%	(FEF	25–75)	and	maximal	voluntary	ventilation	
(MVV),also known as Maximum breathing capacity. 
Other tests may be performed in certain situations.
	Physiotherapy	 should	be	offered	to	patients	with	a	
variety of medical respiratory conditions, with the aim 
of breathlessness management and symptom control, 
mobility and function improvement or maintenance, and 
airway clearance and cough enhancement or support. The 
principal goals of pulmonary rehabilitation are to reduce 
symptoms, improve quality of life, and increase physical 
and emotional participation in everyday activities. 
The components of pulmonary rehabilitation vary 
widely from program to program but a comprehensive 
pulmonary rehabilitation program includes exercise 
training, nutrition counseling, and education. [14]. 
CPT comprises 5 separate elements introduced by 
the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation in 1997: postural drainage 
(PD), percussion (P), vibration (V), deep breathing, 
and directed cough (DC). The term CPT is often more 
broadly used to describe airway clearance techniques 
and does not have to include all the above elements [15].
As there are many evidence for comparing 
the physiotherapy techniques used in the cystic 
bronchiectasis,	 where	the	ACBT	and	flutter	was	
compared	but	the	results	was	both	are	effective,	similarly	
there are also evidence for comparing ACBT with 
acapella	in	cystic	fibrosis,	where	both	are	as	effective	
as each. As there is no evidence for comparing the two equipments working on the forced expiratory techniques 
and ACBT on COPD, so the study over comparing these 
techniques was done.

METHOD
Ethical	clearance	was	obtained.	45	subjects	were	
screened according to the inclusion and exclusion 
criteria.	42	subjects	were	taken	up	and	procedure	 was	
explained to them and informed consent was taken. 
According	 to	fish	bowl	method,	allocation	was	done,	the	
patients were asked to choose the chit and accordingly, 
they were allocated their respective group and their 
techniques.	 Group	A	received	ACBT	technique,	 Group	
B	received	flutter	and	group	C	received	ACAPELLA.	
     74      Indian Journal of Physiotherapy and Occupational Therapy, January-March 2019, Vol.13, No. 1
After the allocation Pre PFT was done and data were 
recorded. 3 days of training were given and then Post 
PFT was done on all the patients for reassessment. 
The patients of Group A, ACBT, consisting of 9 
patients,	were	positioned	 in	a	semi	fowler’s	position	and	
instructed to perform the three phase of ACBT i.e. breathing 
control, thoracic expansion and forced expiration technique. 
The patients were given postural drainage positions or the 
semi	fowler’s	position	according	 to	the	condition	of	the	
patient. The patient was made to relax the upper chest and 
shoulders, made to use the lower chest, diaphragm and took 
normal 3-4 tidal volume breaths (breathing control) (BC)  
for 5 to 10 seconds. The patient was instructed to place 
the hand over the abdomen for the more concentration on 
breathing. In thoracic expansion phase (TEE) , the patient 
was asked to breathe deeply and percussion was given 
by the therapist laterally over the chest. In each session 
3-4 thoracic expansion exercise was given. The cycle of 
breathing control and thoracic expansion was repeated as 
shown in the fig 2 . The same procedure was repeated for 
the next 2 consecutive days for the same patient.  Group 
B: FLUTTER treatment where 14 patients were alloted. 
GROUP C 	were	given	ACAPELLA 	having	19	patients.	For	the	FLUTTER	 it	was	placed	in	the	patient’s	mouth	
and the patient inspired through the nose or through the 
mouth	by	breathing	around	the	flutter	mouthpiece.	 For	the	
ACAPELLA,	 the	resistance	was	set	by	the	therapist	for	the	
patient	according	 to	the	patient’s	comfort	as	the	dial	was	
turned clockwise to increase the resistance from low to 
high. The patient was made to breathe 5 regular breaths and 
alternate	with	5	long	slow	deep	breaths	.	Lastly	the	sputum	
was collected by the sputum mug and the patient is made to 
relax. Thus the same procedure was followed for the 3 days 
as the treatment session.
DATA ANALYSIS AND RESULT
The	data	was	analysed	for	its	statistical	significance	
using	Wilcoxon	Signed	Ranked	test	for	the	significance	
of each group and between the group and among the two 
groups, test applied was paired t-test. They were applied 
for 5 outcome measure like FEV1, FVC, FEV1/ FVC, 
PEFR and MEFR or FEF25-75% there	were	significant	
difference	 between	the	pre	and	post	values	between	the	
group	and	it	was	statistically	 significant.	 Among	the	
groups,	the	values	were	not	statistically	 significant.(table

DISCUSSION
Results	of	this	study	showed	 significant	
improvement in the PFT parameter for the patients using 
three treatments within the group. Among the group, 
there	was	no	significance	 as	three	of	the	each	treatment	
were	as	effective	as	each	other.
There are numerous studies which concluded the 
improvement for FEV1 as decreases in the airway 
resistance and the air reaches the collateral due to relaxation 
and	expansion	created	by	ACBT,	backflow	created	by	the	
acapella	and	also	by	the	vibrations	from	flutter.For FVC , it has occurred due to alveolar opening 
which helps in improving the airway resistance by clearing 
the	secretion.	Researches	 have	been	done	where	the	effect	
of the ACBT in improving the airways resistance proves 
that the physiology of the ACBT and also the FET helps 
in improving the forced vital capacity.  Mikelsons C. in his 
article of ‘The role of physiotherapy in the management of 
COPD’	in	the	journal	of	Respirsatory	 Medicine	concluded	
that The use of FET has also been demonstrated to be 
effective	in	sputum	clearance	in	COPD,	with	FET	and	PD	
being	more	effective	than	cough	alone(19) which improves 
the FEV1/FVC  parameters.  
Indian Journal of Physiotherapy and Occupational Therapy, January-March 2019, Vol.13, No. 1          75      
Nisha	Shinde	and	Shinde	KJ	in	their	research	for	
body positioning found out that body position plays a 
major	role	in	the	airway	maintenance	 in	COPD	patients	
during forced expiration in standing, the greater recoil 
of lung and chest wall combined with higher pressure 
generated by abdominal contractions pushes the air at 
high speed through the narrowing airways resulting in 
higher PEFR.
The reduction of airway resistance by ACBT, 
vibration	of	the	flutter	and	also	the	back	flow	created	by	
acapella, among the three groups, the MEFR or FEF25-
75% has been increased for the ACBT and it depicts that 
ACBT	is	the	effective	technique	 in	improving	 the	mid	
expiratory	flow	rate.
Thus	between	the	three	groups,	the	p	value	>0.05	so	
it	clearly	states	that	there	no	such	significance	 between	
the group. 
CONCLUSION
In	this	study	we	concluded	 that	ACTIVE	CYCLE	
OF	BREATHING	 TECHNIQUE	 (ACBT),	FLUTTER	
and	ACAPELLA 	are	effective	among	the	COPD	patients,	
to improve the lung function when compared within the 
group.	Among	the	three	groups,	they	were	as	effective	
as	each	of	them,	there	was	no	significant	 difference	
between them.

ABSTRACT
Background: One	minute	Sit-Up	Test	is	a	physical	fitness	battery	commonly 	used	to	evaluate	the	endurance	
of an athlete. Performing as many repetitions of sit-up as possible in one minute duration of time reveals the 
endurance level of that athlete which can be used in future for planning the training program.
Objectives: To determine the standard value of one minute Sit-Up Test in the athletes of Belagavi.
Methodology: 220	athletes	(n	=	220)	were	screened	for	the	study.	The	age	criteria	for	this	study	was	18	to	
25 years. Participants were briefed about the nature of the study. Those willing to participate were given 
5 minutes of warm up before sit up procedure and after warm up they were told to perform sit up for one 
minute. The test were performed in three trials and the best value of the three trial were recorded.
Results: The ranges of sit up repetitions per minute in the athletes of Belagavi were from 20 to 76. The average 
sit	up	repetitions	per	minute	for	male	and	female	athletes	is	36.04	±	6.37	and	30.82	±	6.81	respectively.	
Conclusion:  The conclusion of this study revealed that the athletes of the Belagavi city have good endurance 
capacity	as	the	average	sit	up	repetitions	per	minute	for	them	falls	under	the	Good	Grade	category.

Testing and maintaining muscle endurance in the 
athletes is always considered as an important criteria 
for their sports performance.1 In athletes, maintaining 
abdominal muscles endurance is of more important 
for core stability and back support required for long 
durational performance.4,5 This is because, the ability 
to control the position and motion of the trunk over 
the pelvis results in optimum production, transfer and 
control of force and motion to the terminal and distal 
segment in integrated athletic activities hence enhancing 
the sports skill and performance.1,16 However, there is always a debate about the testing measures of endurance 
level in an athlete.
According	 to	the	present	sports	fitness	concept,	
field	based	tests	are	used	instead	of	laboratory	 tests	for	
the evaluation of the motor skills, muscular endurance 
and strength in athletes.2	Generally,	 timed	Weighted	
Squat (ST), Push-Up Test (PUT), Sit-Up Test (SUT), 
and Curl-Up Test (CUT) are used for the evaluation 
of the endurance level in an athlete.3 The timed Sit-
up test (SUT) is commonly performed by athletes that 
defines	the	endurance	 of	the	abdominal	 and	hip	flexor	
muscle and also maintains the core muscle stability.3,12 
It also helps to correlate the core muscles stability with 
action of distal muscles and to maintain this correlation 
always positive.3	Also,	SUT	has	greater	effect	in	the	
rehabilitation	 of	the	injured	athletes	enhancing	 the	time	
laps	in	order	to	return	to	sports	after	an	injury.4
In One Minute SUT, performing as much number of 
sit-up repetitions rates the level of endurance.6 But there 
are	no	any	specific	standard	values	of	Sit-up	repetitions	
for one minute duration. The number of repetitions DOI Number: 10.5958/0973-5674.2019.00015.7 
     78      Indian Journal of Physiotherapy and Occupational Therapy, January-March 2019, Vol.13, No. 1
depend upon the athletes and the type of sports they play. 
In	practice,	many	athlete	fitness	professionals	 have	to	go	
for the endurance test prior to exercise routine for each 
athletes. This gives unequal and non-standardized value 
which	might	provide	improper	and	unreliable	 fitness	
program for them.6 Therefore, a baseline data is required 
for timed sit-up program to apply on the athletes as 
utterly	or	nationally	fitness	batteries.
There are various factors contributing muscular 
endurance	 in	athletes,	comprising	 muscle	strength,	fibre	
type, training, diet, environmental condition, etc. It has 
been found that any changes in geographical conditions 
influences	 the	muscular	endurance	 of	an	athlete.10 The 
level	of	muscular	endurance	 in	athletes	from	different	
states	or	countries	differ	from	each	other.10,17-19 Thus, 
a standard value of timed sit-up repetition in the 
athletes	from	different	geographical	 location	should	be	
determined.  There is paucity of evidences tabulating this 
value in Indian athletes. Hence, this study is intended to 
determine the standard value of one minute sit-up test 
in the various athletes of Belagavi. This value might be 
useful in future to set the abdominal endurance program, 
to rate the endurance level and even to train the athletes 
of Belagavi further to match global standards.
METHODOLOGY
Ethical Clearance was obtained from the Institutional 
Ethical	Committee.	 220	athletic	subjects	of	Belagavi	were	
screened. Both male and female athletes of age group 
18	to	25	years	of	Belagavi	were	included	in	the	study.	
Any athletes taking medicines regularly or under diet 
restriction regimen, having any discomfort or back pain 
while	performing	 trunk	flexion	activity,	or	having	any	
recent abdominal pain or surgery were excluded in the 
study.	Also,	the	female	athletes	during	first	two	days	of	the	
menstrual cycle were excluded.1 They were briefed about 
the nature and procedure of the study. Only those willing to 
participate	were	recruited	for	the	study.	A	Written	informed	
consent was obtained from them. All the participants were 
processed through one minute sit up test.
The test procedure required the athletes to lie down 
on	exercise	mat	with	knees	bent,	feet	flat	on	the	mat	and	
hands	placed	on	ears.	The	athletes’	feet	were	held	by	an	
assistant.	The	assistant	had	to	give	the	command	 “GO”	
and simultaneously start the stop watch. On listening 
the	command,	 the	subjects	had	to	lift	their	upper	body	and touch their knees with elbows and perform the same 
as many times as possible for next one minute. This 
procedure included three trials of SUT, each for one 
minute.	The	final	score	was	the	best	of	the	three	attempts.	
OUTCOME MEASURES
One	minute	Sit-Up	Test	is	a	physical	fitness	battery	
commonly used to evaluate the endurance of an athlete. 
Performing as many repetitions of sit-up as possible in 
one minute duration of time reveals the endurance level 
of that athlete.3,12
Materials: An exercise mat, a stopwatch and a hand 
held tally counter
Scoring: The completion of one sit up was coming up to 
knee	and	going	back	down	flat	on	the	mat.	Only	correctly	
performed sit up were counted.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
The statistical analysis was done using SPSS 
software 21 version. Comparison and correlation of 
male and females athletes in terms of maximum number 
of	sit	ups	in	one	minute	was	done	using	t	test.	Level	of	
significance	was	set	at	p<0.05.
RESULTS
The total 220 athletes participated in this study, 
out	of	which	108	were	male	athletes	and	rest	112	were	
female athletes. All the participants were competed in 
either college (4), district (104), state (57), national (46) 
or	international	 level	(9).	The	participant’s	 mean	±	SD	
years	of	playing	was	3.83	±	2.54	years.	The	years	of	
playing of male athletes was 3.67±2.43 whereas that of 
female was 3.97±2.64 respectively.
The best of three sit up attempts of male was 
36.04±6.37	 while	that	of	female	was	30.82±6.8	
respectively.  Figure 1 shows that value of the best of 
three sit up attempts of male was comparatively more 
than females. Table 1 shows the values of the one 
minute sit up repetitions in the athletes of Belagavi city. 
The	standard	repetitions	 of	overall	athletes	was	33.38	±	
7.08	in	the	ranges	of	20	to	76.	The	duration	of	playing	
of	athletes	had	significantly	 shown	effect	in	the	sit	up	
repetitions (Table 2, 3, 4) .

DISCUSSION
The primary purpose of this study was to record 
the Sit-Up Test (SUT) for one minute in the various 
athletes of Belagavi City. In this study, 220 athletes from 
Belagavi	city	and	of	different	competitive	 level	were	
participated. The participants were experienced athletes 
having	average	of	3.83	±	2.5	years	of	playing	duration	
in either college level/district level/state level/national 
level/international level competitions.
Previous studies have already proven that sit up 
test is used for testing and maintaining the muscular 
endurance.3 This study supports and add some norms to 
the	study	done	by	Sarah	L.	Strand	et	al.	(2014)	which	
stated that sit up test is the battery required to check the 
muscular endurance. They had concluded that sit up test 
along with some other test like curls up, push up and 
planks are used to test as well as maintain the muscular 
endurance of the athletes. 
There are studies done for the values of sit up test 
in athletes other than the Indian athletes. That values are 
used	as	the	global	standard.	According	 to	Golding	et	al.	
(1986),	the	normal	values	of	this	test	ranges	from	25	to	
49	repetitions	 per	minute	for	male	athletes	whereas	18	to	
43 repetitions per minute for female athletes respectively. 
They	had	divided	into	seven	categories	 of	athletes’	
endurance i.e. excellent, good, above average, average, 
below average, poor and very poor. Similarly, this 
study also graded the endurance level into three grades; 
excellent, good and poor. This study provides the values 
of sit ups test for the athletes Belagavi city to match them 
and even train them as per the global standards.
According	 to	Kathryn	M.	Refshauge	 et	al,	the	ability	
to perform the exercise using the core muscles in female 
athletes has comparatively less than the male athletes. 
This study also found that the ability to perform the 
sit up repetitions in one minute time duration is more 
in male athletes of Belagavi city in compare to female athletes. Besides this the duration of playing the sports 
has	significantly	 affected	the	sit	up	repetitions.	 This	
study provides the facts that the endurance level in the 
athlete is more if the athlete is experienced and has the 
longer duration of sports exposure.
Future Scope:  The result of this study might be useful 
in future to set the abdominal endurance program as well 
as to rate the endurance level of the athletes of Belagavi 
City. This value will even be helpful to train the athletes 
of Belagavi further to match the global standards. Future 
study must also be conducted to see if the improved core 
endurance	influences	the	performance	of	the	athletes.
Limitations:  There must be large sample to generalize 
the value of this test.
CONCLUSION
This study provided the spectrum of the common 
values	of	the	sit	up	test	for	the	different	males	and	females	
Indian athletes. These values might be used as a baseline 
data required for timed sit-up program to apply on the 
Indian	athletes	as	utterly	or	nationally	fitness	batteries.

ABSTRACT
Background: 	Mechanical	 low	back	pain	is	an	impairment	 of	musculoskeletal	 system.Lifetime	 prevalence	 of	
low	back	pain	is	60-85%.	Frequent	micro-trauma	 to	the	structures	of	the	spine,	poor	control	and	stabilization	
leads	to	LBP 	and	eventually	causes	functional	limitation.
Purpose:	To	find	whether	Core	Stabilization	 Training	with	Pressure	Biofeedback	 could	reduce	pain	and	
improves functional activity in patients with mechanical low back pain.
Aim:	To	study	the	effectiveness	 of	Core	Stabilization	 Training	with	Pressure	Biofeedback	 in	reducing	pain	and	
improving	 functional	activity	in	subjects	with	mechanical	 low	back	pain	between	the	age	group	of	20-25	years.
Objective: 	To	find	out	the	effect	of	core	stabilization	 training	with	pressure	biofeedback	 in	reducing	pain	and	
improving	 functional	activity	in	subjects	with	mechanical	 low	back	pain	between	the	age	group	of	20-25	years.
Method:	The	study	was	conducted	 on	30	subjects	between	the	age	group	of	20-25	years	with	mechanical	
low back pain and according to the inclusion criteria were recruited in the study. NPRS at rest and activity, 
Modified	ODI	was	assessed	PRE	and	POST 	treatment.
Results:	P	value:	less	than	0.05	for	NPRS	(pain	at	rest	and	activity)and	 modified	ODI	i.e.	core	stabilization	
training with pressure biofeedback had statistical improvement in NPRS (Pain at rest and activity) and 
modified	ODI	score.
Conclusion: 	Core	stabilization 	training	with	pressure	biofeedback	 is	effective	in	reducing	pain	(at	rest	and	
activity)	and	functional	 disability	in	subjects	between	the	age	group	of	20-25	years	with	mechanical	 low

INTRODUCTION
Low	back	pain	is	a	common	musculoskeletal	
impairment	 affecting	 80%	of	population	 at	some	
point in their life. It is an important clinical, social, 
economic	 and	public	health	issue	affecting	population	
indiscriminately. It is considered to be one of the leading 
causes of disability contributing to more sickleaves1. In 
India	incidence	of	LBP	in	general	population	 was	found	
to	be	23.09%	and	has	lifetime	prevalence	of	60-85%	2.
Mechanical	 low	back	pain	can	be	defined	as	back	
pain caused by placing abnormal stress and strain on 
vertebral column and muscles typically, arises from bad 
habits, such as poor posture, poorly designed seating and improper bending and lifting activities. Mechanical 
low back pain is characterized by increase in pain with 
motion	and	decreases	with	rest.	Chronic	pain	is	defined	
as pain lasting more than 12 weeks3. Characteristic 
features of mechanical low back pain: pain often refers 
to	the	buttocks	and	thigh,	morning	stiffness,	there	is	pain	
on	forward	flexion	and	aggravated	by	motion4.
Core	stability	exercise	can	be	defined	as	restoration	
of augmentation of the ability of the neuro-muscular 
system to control and protect the spine from the 
injury.	The	local	muscles	are	said	to	be	crucial	in	this	
mechanism.5 Muscles related to core stability are 
multifidus,	 transverses	 abdominis,	 external/internal	DOI Number: 10.5958/0973-5674.2019.00016.9

oblique abdominis, paraspinalis. It has been speculated 
that this method of training may be useful in decreasing 
the risk of back pain.6 Previous studies suggested 
that Core stabilization exercises showed marked 
improvement, while treating for long duration such as 
8	weeks	duration.	So	this	study	was	framed	with	shorter	
duration of 2 weeks.
Hence	this	study	was	intended	to	find	whether	Core	
Stabilization Training with Pressure Biofeedback could 
reduce pain and improve functional activity using NPRS 
and	Modified	Oswestry	index	in	patient	with	mechanical	
low back pain.
AIM
To	study	the	effectiveness	 of	Core	Stabilization 	
Training with Pressure Biofeedback in reducing pain and 
improving	 functional	activity	in	subjects	with	mechanical 	
low back pain between the age group of 20-25 years.
OBJECTIVE
To	find	out	the	effect	of	core	stabilization	 training	
with pressure biofeedback in reducing pain and 
improving functional activity for 2 week period in 
subjects	with	mechanical	 low	back	pain	between	the	age	
group of 20-25 years.
MATERIAL AND METHOD

PROCEDURE
Subjects	clinically	diagnosed	 with	mechanical	 low	
back pain were screened according to inclusion and 
exclusion criteria. Ethical clearance was obtained and 
informed	consent	was	taken	from	each	subject.	Subjects	
were	briefed	about	the	study	&	the	intervention.30	
Patients were recruited and were given core stabilization 
training	with	pressure	biofeedback.	 The	effect	of	
intervention was measured using outcome measures 
comprising of NPRS (pain at rest and activity) and 
Modified	ODI	before	and	after	2	weeks.

supine position, knees were stabilized by the 
therapist. Directions were given to move head and 
shoulder slowly from the ground.
 2. Right Side Bridge: 	Subjects	were	moved	to	right	
side lying and upper arm was aligned vertical on 
the	ground	and	elbow	flexed	to	90	degrees,	right	
elbow was on the ground and forearm rested on 
the	floor.	The	participants	 were	asked	to	raise	the	
pelvis	from	the	floor	between	knees	and	elbows;	
and was instructed to hold it in a straight line 
“plank” position.7

DISCUSSION
This	study	was	aimed	to	find	out	the	outcomes	of	
core stabilization exercises using pressure biofeedback 
in reducing pain and functional disability in mechanical 
low	back	pain.	This	study	included	30	subjects	with	
mechanical low back pain of both genders between age 
group of 20-25 years. Through convenient sampling 
they were recruited randomly in the study and received 
core stabilization exercises using pressure biofeedback. 
Pain was measured using NPRS before intervention and 
after 2 weeks of intervention. Functional disability was 
measured using ODI before intervention and after 2 
weeks of intervention.
V ARIABLE 1: PAIN (NPRS) AT REST
Using paired t test for analysis mean pre treatment 
Pain (NPRS) at rest score ,the p value obtained was 
<0.05	which	implies	that	it	is	statistically	 significant.	
Indian Journal of Physiotherapy and Occupational Therapy, January-March 2019, Vol.13, No. 1          85      
Thus	treatment	had	an	effect	in	reducing	pain	at	rest	in	
patient with mechanical low back pain after 2 weeks of 
treatment. The result found in our study is accordance 
with	study	done	by	Serish	ali	et	al	(2017)	on	effect	
of lumbar stabilization exercises in the management 
of chronic low back pain. It was 2 weeks protocol. 
Outcome	measures	 used	were	NPRS,	Modified	ODI	
and goniometer. The study concluded that lumbar 
stabilization along with conventional physiotherapy 
are	found	to	be	more	effective	in	chronic	low	back	pain	
management in reducing pain and functional disability.8
One of the important factors that modulate nociceptor 
sensitivity is the acidity (pH) of the surrounding tissue 
in the lumbopelvic region. An altered pH of the local 
muscles of the lumbopelvic region is related to the 
accumulation	 of	inflammatory	 soup	and	mechanical	
sensitization of the peripheral and central nocicepetor 
among	patient	with	chronic	low	back	pain.	Goal	of	Core	
stabilization exercises is to increase circulation and 
movements of the lumbopelvic region to wash out the 
retained	inflammatory	 mediators	 and	facilitate	muscle	
activation and thus reduces the low back pain.9
Reduction in pain may also be due to Core exercises 
enhances the endurance of central part of the trunk, 
reduces	the	tension	in	the	ligaments	 and	joints	of	the	
spine	fix	them	in	the	neutral	position	reduce	the	pain	
intensity.10
V ARIABLE 2: PAIN (NPRS) AT ACTIVITY.
Using paired t test for analysis Pain (NPRS) at 
activity, p value obtained was <0.05 which implies that 
it	is	statistically	 significant.	 Thus	the	treatment	had	an	
effect	in	reducing	pain	during	activity	in	patient	with	
mechanical low back pain after 2 weeks of treatment.
The result found in our study is accordance with 
studies done by Suresh Babu Reddy (2015) on	Effect	of	
core stabilization program and conventional exercises 
in the management of chronic mechanical low back 
pain .They performed a randomized control trial on 40 
subjects	between	age	group	30-50.	Result	showed	that	
the	outcome	of	this	study	had	highly	significant	 statistical	
changes lead us to the conclusion that “Core stabilization 
program	is	more	effective	in	the	management	 of	chronic	
mechanical low back pain than conventional exercises.”11
Reduction of pain on activity may be due to 
Core stability exercises produces low load isometric contraction	 thus	producing	 hypoalgesic	 effect	on	
contracting body part as it activates central inhibitory 
pain mechanism by static muscle contraction thus 
upsurge the secretion of beta endorphins and activates 
the system that regulates pain. Central inhibitory pain 
mechanism activates secretion of endogenous opioids 
and in turn reduces the pain perception.12
V ARIABLE 3: FUNCTIONAL DISABILITY 
[MODIFIED OSWESTRY DISABILITY 
INDEX (ODI)]
Using	paired	t	test	for	analysis	for	modified	ODI	
score, p value obtained was <0.05 which implies that 
it	is	statistically	 significant	 The	mean	pre-treatment	 of	
scores	of	modified	ODI,	the	p	value	obtained	was	<	0.05	
which	implied	that	it	was	statistically	 significant	 thus	the	
treatment  had	an	effect	on	reducing	the	disability	and	
improving function in patients with mechanical low 
back pain after 2 weeks of treatment.
Similar	study	on	effectiveness	 of	core	stabilization	
exercises on functional disability in patients with chronic 
low back pain results of the study were in accordance 
to our study showing improvements in the oswestry 
disability	Questionnaire	 scores	post	treatment	performed	
by	Amila	Kapetanovic	et	al.	(2016).13
Reduced disability may be due to improved motor 
control caused by core stabilization training. Motor 
control plays a crucial role in stabilizing spinal system. 
Maintaining lumbar spinal stability involves three 
interactive systems: passive support system, which 
relies on ligaments and fascia of skeletal muscle; the 
active contraction system, in which lumbar spinal 
movements and stability are maintain by contracting 
the core muscles; and the central nervous system which 
place a leading role in motor control. The CNS can 
respond to the sensation produced in active and passive 
system by using the central nerves to control motor 
co-ordination. The CNS governs physical action and 
prevents interference in order to maintain spinal stability 
and lumbar spinal movements.14
Improved functional activity may be due to 
following mechanism it involves stabilization via 
intra-abdominal pressure, which reduces compressive 
forces in the core system. During augmented drawing 
in of the abdominal wall training, the deep abdominal 
muscles contract against the viscera, pushing the viscera 
     86      Indian Journal of Physiotherapy and Occupational Therapy, January-March 2019, Vol.13, No. 1
superiorly into the diaphragm and inferiorly into the 
pelvic	floor.	This	results	in	increased	abdominal	 pressure,	
which elevates the diaphragm and leads to contraction of 
pelvic	floor	musculature	 while	concurrently	 assisting	in	
intersegmental stabilization of the lumbo-pelvic system 
(Stanton	T	2008).15
Another reason to improve functional activity 
may be due to plastic changes at the brain due to 
exercising	 specific	muscle	of	the	lower	back	region.	In	
turn reprogramming the brain for optimal stabilization 
targeting	right	muscle	for	right	task	thus	the	subjects	
were more focused and attentive toward exercise by 
giving visual biofeedback during training session.16
CONCLUSION
Core stabilization training with pressure biofeedback 
is	effective	in	reducing	pain	(at	rest	and	activity)	and	
functional	 disability	in	subjects	between	the	age	group	
of 20-25 years with mechanical low back pain.
Limitations of the Study
 zNo follow up was done after the said duration of 
study hence, long-term outcomes of the both the 
treatment techniques were not evaluated.
 z	Outcome	measures	were	purely	subjective.
 zQuantitative	 measures	were	not	used	to	compare	the	
effect	of	individual	 exercises	on	isolated	muscles	to	
know	which	exercise	gives	better	effect	in	reducing	
pain and disability.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common 
musculoskeletal	 condition	affecting	the	quality	of	life	of	
older	adults.		Three	major	physical	impairments,	 such	as	
knee	pain,	stiffness,	and	decreased	 quadriceps	 strength,	
are highly associated with knee OA and are believed to 
contribute to physical disability and progression of the 
disease.1 For patients with knee osteoarthritis, exercise 
is	the	most	common	and	effective	therapy	for	enhancing	
knee function and reducing pain; it is also more cost-effective	than	other	types	of	medical	interventions.	
However, its mechanism is not fully understood.2 It has 
being estimated that the number of people over the age 
of	65	years	will	be	doubled	in	the	first	two	decades	in	the	
21st century.3 In the third National Health And Nutrition 
Examination Survey (NHANES III), approximately 37% 
of	participants	 age	>	60	years	or	older	had	radiographic	
knee OA.4 A recent survey in India reported that the 
prevalence of OA in older adults more than 65 years of 
age was 32.6% in the rural population and 60.3% in the 
urban population.5
There are two types of osteoarthritis. Primary 
osteoarthritis is a chronic degenerative disease that 
is commonly related genetic inheritance.6 Secondary 
arthritis this tends to show up earlier in life, due to an 
injury,	kneeling	or	squatting	for	extended	amounts	of	
time, diabetes, or obesity.6DOI Number: 10.5958/0973-5674.2019.00017.0

Osteoarthritis is a degenerative condition primarily 
affecting	 the	articular	cartilage.	 Changes:	 increase	
in water content and depletion of the proteoglycans 
from	the	cartilage	matrix;	its	fibrillation;	 cartilage	
abraded by contact between the opposing articular 
surfaces; underlying bone exposed; subchondral bone 
becomes hard and glossy; bone at the margins of the 
joint	hypertrophies	 to	form	a	rim	of	projecting	 spurs	
known as osteophyte. A similar mechanism results in 
the formation of subchondral cysts and sclerosis.7 The 
loose	flakes	of	cartilage	incite	synovial	inflammation	
and thickening of the capsule, leading to deformity and 
stiffness	of	the	joint.	Often	one	compartment	 of	a	joint,	
the	medial	compartment	 is	affected	more	than	the	lateral,	
leading to a varus deformity (genuvarum).7 Weaknesses	
of the shock-absorbing and weight-bearing muscles may 
lead to structural damage of the articular cartilage and 
subchondral	 bone,	as	well	as	decrease	joint	stability,	
which is a risk factor for knee OA progression.8
The advantages of a proprioceptive circuit exercise 
are reduced muscle fatigue, which is generally observed 
during resistance exercise, and improved exercise 
efficiency	by	minimization	 of	the	recovery	time	between	
exercise sets.2 An	Open	Kinematics	 Chain	(OKC)	is	
performed	 when	the	limb	is	not	fixed	and	allowed	to	
move freely through space. It helps in decreasing the 
joint	compression.9 Exercise helps in decreasing pain, 
improving strength and endurance, improving range of 
motion and connective tissue elasticity as well as exercise 
decreases functional limitation by improving walking 
speed, gait, physical activity and decreasing depression 
and anxiety.3 An open kinetic chain leg extension exercises 
have been the traditional means of strengthening the 
quadriceps muscle, however several authors report that 
these exercises exacerbate the symptoms in many patients 
with patello-femoral arthritis.10
The strength of the knee extensor muscles was 
greater	than	that	of	the	knee	flexor	muscle	at	baseline,	
and an OA related reduction in muscle strength was 
observed only in the knee extensor muscles, that is, in the 
quadriceps muscles, which is deemed as the cause of the 
pain	and	physical	dysfunction	 of	the	knee	joint	in	these	
patients8. Thus, such as knee isokinetic exercises, knee 
extension	and	flexion	exercises	from	a	sitting	position,	
straight leg raising exercises, and knee curl exercises)8. 
AIM
To	compare	the	effectiveness	 of	proprioceptive	
circuit exercises versus open kinematics chain exercises on pain and improve muscle strength and physical 
function in osteoarthritis knee patients. 
METHODOLOGY
This was an experimental study carried out in 
College of Physiotherapy, Parul Institute, Vadodara. 
Data	of	60	indoor	patient	of	OA	Knee,	age	between	
40 to 65 years8, irrespective of gender, collected from 
Parul Sevashram Hospital, Vadodara. Study done by 
verbal consent of patients of unilateral of OA knee and 
pain for a duration of more than 3 months8; diagnosis 
with degenerative OA and had radiological stage 2 and 
3	unilateral	 OA	knee	according	 to	the	Kellgren	and	
Lawrence	scale.14 Exclusion of patients of previous and 
recent	traumatic	injury	to	knee,	subjects	with	secondary	
OA knee, serious medical condition such as heart or 
pulmonary conditions, spinal problems and patients with 
recent knee surgery.
The testing procedure was properly explained to 
subjects.	Two	Groups	A	and	B	made.	Each	consist	30	
OA	knee	patients.	Group	A	were	perform	Proprioceptive	
Circuit Exercise Program.2 The detail exercise program 
consisted of repetition of walking in place and four 
different	types	of	proprioceptive	 circuit	exercise,	
including wall slides, half squats, lunges, stationary 
bicycle.	Group	B	were	perform	Open	Kinematic	 Chain	
Exercises in form  sitting knee extension, prone knee 
bending, hamstring curls, chair scoots were perform in 
sets of 10 repetitions; 1 set of all exercises were perform 
twice a day for the 1st week, and this were progress to 2 
sets twice a day until the 3rd week and then 3 sets twice a 
day until the 5th week.  
To outcome measures of the OA knee patients will 
be performed by following ways: (1) Pain intensity will 
be given by NPRS (Numerical Pain Rating Scale)8,11, 
all the participants completed the NPRS by indicating 
the average pain level experienced before and after the 
intervention.	 (2)	WOMAC  index	(Western	Ontario	and	
Mc. master universities osteoarthritis index)8,12 perceived 
pain,	knee	stiffness	and	functional	 ability	will	be	assess	
by	WOMAC	 index,	done	initially.	The	individual	
completing	 the	scale,	rated	her	perceived	pain,	stiffness	
and	functional	 ability	on	a	5-point	Likert’s	scale	which	
is scored from 0-4 i.e.:- o-none, 1-slight, 2-moderate, 
3-severe, 4-extreme. (3) MMT (Manual Muscle Test)13, 
will be a convenient tool for evaluating the muscle 
strength and level of impairment. Muscle strength is 
rated from 0 to 5 according to the muscle performance 
against resistance.

chain exercises in form of isometric quadriceps and 
straight leg exercises for 5 days a week for 5 days whereas 
control	Group	B	did	not	perform	any	exercises.	All	the	
measurements were taken at baseline (week 0) and at the

Diminished	 knee	joint	proprioception	 is	highly	
correlated with the level of pain, and the interaction 
between proprioception and muscle strength is closely 
related to functional body movements. This indicates 
that application of proprioceptive circuit exercise 
improves	proprioception	 and	knee	joint	muscle	function,	
thereby	reducing	patient	pain.	Strengthening	 knee	joint	
muscle function likely helps reduce pain. This study 
showed that proprioceptive circuit exercise in patients 
with	degenerative	 knee	Osteoarthritis	 can	be	an	effective	
way	of	strengthening	 knee	joint	muscle	function	and	
reducing pain. The results are expected to provide a 
useful	basis	for	future	efforts	to	enhance	knee	joint	
functions and improve pain control in patients with knee 
osteoarthritis.2
We	got	significant	 improvement	 after	3	weeks	post	
treatment	of	the	outcome	measures	of	two	Groups.	For	
pre	–	post	NPRS	in	Group	A	the	two-tailed	 p	value	is	
<	0.0001,	considered	 extremely	 significant.	 t	=	-3.441	
to	-2.88	with	29	degrees	of	freedom.	For	pre	–	post	
WOMAC	in	Group	A	the	two-tailed	 p	value	is	<	0.0001,	
considered	 extremely	 significant.	 t	=	22.85	to	-19.011	
with	29	degrees	of	freedom.	For	pre	–	post	MMT	flexors	
in	Group	A	the	two-tailed	 p	value	is	<	0.0001,	considered	
extremely	 significant.	 t	=	17.5879	with	29	degrees	of	
freedom.	For	pre	–	post	MMT	extensors	in	Group	A	the	
two-tailed p value is < 0.0001, considered extremely 
significant.	t	=	17.5879	with	29	degrees	of	freedom.	
Sung-bum J et al2 applied proprioceptive circuit 
exercise to patients with degenerative knee Osteoarthritis 
and	examined	its	effects	on	knee	joint	muscle	function	
and the level of pain. In this study, 14 patients with 
knee	osteoarthritis	 in	two	Groups,	a	proprioceptive	
circuit	exercise	Group	(n=7)	and	control	Group	(n=7),	
were	examined	 and	was	used	to	assess	knee	joint	
muscle function, and a visual analogue scale was used 
to measure pain level and resulted in the proprioceptive 
circuit	exercise	Group,	knee	joint	muscle	function	and	
pain	levels	improved	significantly,	 whereas	in	the	control	
Group,	no	significant	 improvement	 was	observed	and	
concluded a proprioceptive circuit exercise may be an 
effective	way	to	strengthen	 knee	joint	muscle	function	
and reduce pain in patients with knee osteoarthritis.

Metgud S et al14	said	to	compare	the	effect	of	
proprioceptive exercises in osteoarthritis and total 
replaced	knees	using	the	knee	society	score	and	joint	
position sense. Participants were divided into two 
groups;	Group	A	comprised	 of	the	total	knee	replacement	
and	Group	B	was	the	osteoarthritis	 group.	Group	A	was	
given exercises along with ambulation and static and 
resistance cycling and training of functional activities. 
Group	B	was	given	exercises	and	seven	proprioceptive	
exercises followed by continuous short wave diathermy 
cross-fire	method	for	15	minutes.	The	results	show	a	
significant	 difference	 between	the	two	groups	using	
VAS	and	JPS	whereas	showed	no	significant	 difference	
between	the	two	groups	on	using	the	KSS	and	concluded	
that	proprioceptive	 exercises	are	beneficial	in	improving	
the	joint	position	sense	in	patients	with	osteoarthritis	 as	
well as total knee replacements.
CONCLUSION
Both	groups	were	statistically	 significant	 and	
showed	beneficial	 effect	on	reducing	pain,	improved	
muscle strength, physical function in OA knee patients 
but after exercises between both groups proprioceptive 
circuit	exercise	Group	A	was	extremely	 statistically	
significant	 than	open	kinematic	 chain	Group	B.	So	
Group	A	indicating	 more	reducing	pain	and	beneficial	
effect	on	reducing	pain,	improved	 muscle	strength,	
physical function in OA knee patients. Hence alternative 
hypothesis is accepted.

INTRODUCTION
India has been given the tag of an aging nation, 
India’s	health	programs	have	shed	light	on	the	problems	
faced by middle aged persons, maternal and child 
health and disease control. Due to the rise in modern 
technology and health care facilities there is a rise 
in the geriatric population. There is the other face of 
the coin which needs to be explored in terms of the 
medical and socioeconomic status of these geriatric 
individuals1. According to the National Institute of 
Mental Health, Depression is persistent sad or empty 
mood, a feeling of hopelessness, pessimism, feelings 
of guilt, worthlessness, helplessness, loss of interest, 
decreased  energy and fatigue, being slowed down 
while	performing	 activities,	difficulty	in	concentrating,	
remembering and making decisions2. It is often ignored 
or goes unnoticed in the elderly and has a considerable 
impact on physical health, social systems and overall 
functioning putting depression in the top most position 
to be the leading cause of functional impairment 
worldwide3,4 . A study conducted on the point prevalence of depression in geriatric persons in India is found to be 
from 13% to 25%5.  There are various pharmacological 
drugs available for the treatment of depression like 
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), Tricyclic 
antidepressants(TCA) and Monoamine oxidase 
inhibitors (MAOI) but the long term prognosis is subtle 
with incomplete recovery and higher rates of relapses 
(50%-90%) over a period of 2 -3 years. The goal of 
rehabilitation is not only the treatment of depression but 
to minimize or prevent the recurrence3,6 .
Body	awareness,	 is	the	subjective,	 phenomenological	
aspect of proprioception and interoception that enters 
conscious	 awareness,	 and	is	modifiable	 by	mental	
processes including attention, interpretation, appraisal, 
beliefs,	memories,	 conditioning,	 attitudes	and	affect7. 
Body Awareness Therapy (BAT) is a physiotherapeutic 
approach	for	the	adjustment	 of	pathological	 tension	
in the body and also is the ability to recognize subtle

and to recapture normal balance of the body in BAT8. 
Neuroimaging studies also indicate changes in the 
structures of the brain involved in body awareness 
after BAT9. Evidence based treatments for depression 
continues to expand but the responses brought about by 
them are limited and the condition has a high relapse rate 
in the elderly3. Depression in this population is linked 
with	financial	problems,	 insecurity	 and	loneliness	 as	
well as decreases body awareness1. There is a continuous 
need for research that predicts successful treatment 
outcomes in depression; an intervention that promotes 
a	holistic	change	is	likely	to	benefit	these	individuals10. 
BAT has been done for patients with chronic illness 
and depression but has not been conducted on elderly 
persons with depression9. Thus the aim of the current 
study	was	to	determine	effect	of	body	awareness	 therapy	
on depression in geriatric population.
METHOD
In	the	region	of	Belgavi,	 Karnataka,	 n=67	
participants from 3 old age homes were screened using 
Geriatric	Depression	 Scale	in	2017.	The	inclusion	
criteria	was	i)	Above	the	age	of	65	ii)	A	score	of	>5	on	
the	Geriatric	depression	 scale	iii)	Understand	 commands	
and iv) Ambulate with or without an assistive device.  
The exclusion criteria were that i) Cognitive impairment 
ii)  Pre-existing neurological condition that alters the 
higher mental functions iii) Any other psychiatric 
condition.	 Once	they	fulfilled	the	inclusion	 and	
exclusion	criteria	n=30	older	adults	were	included	in	the	
study.	The	Research	Ethics	committee	 of	KLE	Academy	
of higher education, Belgavi, India approved the study 
and all the participants were provided a written informed 
consent prior to the commencement of the study. After 
the completion of the initial assessment; a three week, 
twice a week BAT intervention was given.
Intervention and Outcome Measure:  Basic Body 
Awareness intervention was given; the treatment session 
lasted for a total of 40 minutes. The initial 5 minutes 
was orientation and breathing exercises subsequently 
10 minutes of soothing music after which a 10 minute 
relaxation	 technique	in	this	case	Jacobson’s	 relaxation.	
Following this three stages of progression of BAT for three weeks were given and culminating with 5 minutes 
of breathing exercise4.	The	first	stage	included	lying	
down exercises, stretching and contracting gradually 
integrated with breathing and voice, standing exercises 
which included coordination exercises; these exercises 
were integrated into normal breathing. Stage two 
consisted of standing exercises like isolated movements, 
spot marching, weight shifts, posture exercises and non 
verbal exercises. All these exercises were coordinated 
with breathing. Stage three incorporated walking 
exercises	that	aimed	to	be	beneficial	in	a	natural,	relaxed	
and rhythmical gait with normal associated movements. 
Balance exercises and postural correction exercises 
were	also	included	in	this	stage.	Geriatric	Depression	
Scale was used as a self rating screening tool to measure 
depressive symptoms in older adults, 15 items are present 
in the short form and the recall time is past week. It is 
designed as a self-administered questionnaire, though 
oral assistance and/or interview can be utilized. The total 
score is calculated by summing responses that endorse 
depression.	 The	GDS	was	used	pre	and	post	BAT.
RESULTS
Statistical analysis was done comparing the pre and 
post	GDS	using	the	paired	t	test.	There	was	a	12.9%	
change	in	the	values	and	the	p	value	=	0.0001	which	is	
significant.	 Also	a	3	month	follow	up	was	taken	in	which	
the	p	value	was	0.0393	which	is	significant.

DISCUSSION
In	the	present	study,	the	effects	of	BAT	on	
depression	 in	geriatric	persons	as	measured	by	the	GDS	
were	investigated.	 The	GDS	appears	to	be	a	reliable	and	
valid instrument with scales of adequate consistency in 
this study population11. After the intervention and a three 
month	follow	up,	the	comparison	 showed	significantly	
statistical results which indicated that BAT may be 
indicated	and	may	have	a	carryover	 effect.	GDS	is	a	
subjective	 scale	and	the	“YES”	answer	questions	were	
the feeling of worthlessness, helplessness and their 
present situation. Some participants complained of 
memory issues and that they were easily fatigued. Yang 
B et al indicated that in relation to depression cognition 
has	a	negative	influence12. This could be due to the 
frustration felt by the participant in relation to activities 
of	daily	living	if	memory	is	affected	.		The	participants	
in the present study were in a old age home away from 
their families, this may have given the “YES” on the 
GDS	where	they	felt	that	they	have	no	purpose	and	
find	that	their	life	is	empty,	while	many	had	left	their	
hobbies	and	quit	doing	the	things	that	they	enjoyed.	
Potter R et al conducted a study on the impact of the 
Physical Environment on depression of older residents 
in care homes, he concluded that the overall physical 
environment	 did	not	have	a	major	role	in	their	depressive	
symptoms but outdoor access and social interaction had 
a positive relation to depression13.
DeJong et al conducted a study and noted that Body 
Awareness has been proposed to be the mechanism for 
BAT and it involves an attentional focus on and awareness 
of internal body sensations9. Several studies support the 
notion of body awareness in mindfulness training and 
thus takling depression which has been shown to have 
decreased levels of body awareness. Danielsson et al 
concluded	 that	in	major	depression,	 BAT	enhanced	
perceptual openness and challenged the numbness 
experienced in depression4. In addition, the pre and post 
GDS	scores	after	BAT	is	significant	 as	p=0.0001	which	
indicates that body awareness is increased in apparently 
normal geriatric persons with depression in comparison 
to a study done on persons who have chronic illness with 
depression. The limitations were that the Body Awareness 
component was not scored and also follow up to determine 
the	lasting	effects	of	BAT 	were	not	conducted.
CONCLUSION
In conclusion, the data that was collected and 
analyzed suggests that BAT decreases depression as 
measured	by	the	GDS.It may be worthwhile to note that the interventions 
that encourage an overall wellbeing and change towards 
body	awareness	 will	benefit	this	target	group.	The	
limitations of this study was that the measure of initial 
and change in Body Awareness was not measured also 
the participants were not followed up to see the long 
term	efficacy	of	BAT

ABSTRACT
Introduction: 	Lateral	Ankle	Instability	 has	been	one	of	the	common	causes	of	impairments	 in	the	lower	
extremity	injury	resulting	from	repetitive	ankle	sprains	to	the	lateral	ankle	ligament	complex.	This	may	lead	
to pain and disturbed proprioception resulting in positional fault of articular surfaces, poor postural control 
and weight distribution. Physiotherapy thus aims in reducing the pain, realignment of the articular surfaces 
thereby	improving	 postural	control	and	weight	on	the	affected	ankle	joint/s.	The	primary	purpose	of	this	
study	was	to	assess	the	immediate	 effects	of	Mulligan	fibular	repositioning	 ankle	taping	on	the	NPRS	and	
Weight	Distribution	in	a	case	of	Lateral	 Ankle	Instability.
Method:  A 20 year old female student, with left lateral ankle pain, had complains of chronic pain around 
the lateral malleolus since 2.5 months after playing basketball. The pain aggravated with squatting and 
forward lunges. The outcome measures were Numerical Pain Rating Scale that measured the pain intensity 
and percentage body weight distribution during squat as measured on Neurocom Balance Master System 
(version	9.1).	A	fibular	posterolateral-superior	 tape	as	described	by	Mulligan	was	applied	on	an	undertape	
and the outcome measures were again noted. Results : Pre treatment and Post treatment, pain reduced from 
4/10 to 2/10 during squatting and forward lunge respectively. Also the Percentage of Body weight distributed 
on the left ankle improved immediately after the application of tape.
Conclusion:  Fibular repositioning tape as described by Mulligan not only reduces pain but also improves 
the	weight	falling	on	the	affected	ankle	joint/s.
Keywords:  Mulligan Tape, Lateral Ankle Sprain, Proprioception, Fibula repositioning tape.

Chronic Ankle Instability (CAI) is a common 
disability	 in	the	lower	extremity	 injuries.	It	results	
from repercussions of acute ankle sprains leading to 
giving way sensation and self reported disability. 1 
Common	 mechanism	 of	injury	that	is	postulated	 is	
extremes	of	plantarflexion	 and	inversion	 position	of	
ankle	where	the	weak	anterior	tibio-fibular	 ligament	
(ATFL)	and	calcaneofibular	 ligament	(CFL)	are	prone	
for	varying	degree	of	injury	with	minimal	force.2 The theories commonly postulated for the cause of CAI 
are: mechanical instability resulting from poor control 
by the ligaments and functional impairment resulting 
from loss of proprioception and mechanical instability 
which together leads to CAI. Damage to the ligaments 
often results in pathological laxity which leads to ankle 
being put in to vulnerable positions during functional 
activities	 causing	subsequent	 injury.3 Restriction in 
arthrokinematics related to repetitive ankle sprains 
leads	to	positional	 fault	at	the	inferior	tibiofibular	
joint.	Individuals	 with	CAI	may	have	an	anteriorly	and	
inferiorly	displaced	distal	fibula.4	The	ATFL	ligament	
stuck in this position becomes more slack in resting 
position.	When	the	rearfoot	begins	to	supinate,	the	talus	
can	go	through	a	greater	range	of	motion	before	ATFL	
becomes taut, leading to further laxity and sprains.3 
Since	ligaments	 play	a	major	role	in	proprioception,	
lateral ankle instability that results in weakening of 
the	ligaments	 may	lead	to	insufficiencies	 in	not	only	DOI Number: 10.5958/0973-5674.2019.00019.4

proprioception but also postural control, neuromuscular 
control and functional impairments.3, 5
Since CAI leads to an antero-inferior positional 
fault	of	the	distal	fibula	leading	to	laxity	of	the	lateral	
ankle ligaments and disturbing the proprioception, 
methods	which	aim	to	reposition	the	fibula	are	needed	to	
treat such conditions. One of the methods for supporting 
such	weakened	 ankle	joint	is	application	 of	tape	as	
proposed by Mulligan 4. Taping is known to improve 
the neuromuscular proprioceptive and physiological 
processes,	 offering	additional	 awareness	 of	the	foot	
position and direction of motion. Mulligan Ankle 
taping,	in	addition	to	these	effects,	may	correct	the	
antero-inferior	 positional	fault	of	distal	fibula,	leading	to	
a better postural control and weight distribution. There 
are	very	few	studies	that	have	documented	 the	effects	
of Mulligan Taping on the weight distribution in a 
functional activity. Hence the need arises to assess if the 
Mulligan Tape plays any role in improving the weight 
distribution	at	the	ankle	joint.
MATERIALS AND METHOD
Case Report: Case History:  The	subject	was	a	20	year	
old female student who presented with the complaints 
of mild pain on the left side ankle. She gave a history 
of sudden onset of pain when playing basketball match 
while	jumping	and	landing	back	on	the	ground.	Intensity	
of pain was 7 on 10 on Numerical Pain Rating Scale 
(NPRS). The pain had been continuous since then at 
the lateral side of the ankle, which aggravated with 
weight	bearing	activity,	specifically	 as	mentioned	 by	
the	subject,	squatting	and	forward	lunges.	The	subject	
continued with her normal activities, including playing 
basketball and did not undergo any treatment. She also 
gave a history of repetitive ankle sprains since then on 
the same side ankle giving rise to pain at the lateral 
side	of	ankle	joint.	Important	to	also	mention	is	that	the	
subject	described	inability	of	put	complete	weight	on	the	
left	ankle	since	the	injury.	A	period	of	2.5	months	had	
elapsed	when	the	subject	became	a	part	of	this	study.	
During initial assessment, the pain intensity was 4 on 10 
on NPRS around the lateral malleolus with squatting and 
forward lunge. The Range of Motion and the strength 
of	the	muscles	of	ankle	joint	were	within	normal	limits.	
The only complaint was pain during squatting and 
forward lunge.Outcome Measures:
 1. NPRS
 2. Percentage of body weight distribution during 
Squatting as measured on NEUROCOM 
BALANCE	MASTER.
METHODOLOGY
A	written	informed	consent	of	the	subject	was	taken	
prior to the study and was explained about the procedure 
of assessment and management. Initial assessment 
consisted of examination of range of motion and 
manual	muscle	testing	of	the	ankle	joint.	Pre	treatment	
NPRS was noted. This was followed by assessing the 
percentage of weight distribution during squatting on 
the	NEUROCOM	 BALANCE	 MASTER	 SYSTEM	
(VERSION 9.1).
The	subject	was	initially	shown	a	demo	video	of	
the procedure. Standing on the force platform, four 
trials	were	performed.	 The	first	trial	consisted	of	subject	
standing relaxed on the force platform while the weight 
distribution was measured (0° Squat). This was followed 
by measuring the weight distribution at three angles of 
squat: 30°, 60°, and 90°. The Pre treatment outcome 
measures were documented.

Balance Master
The	subject	was	then	applied	with	the	fibular	
repositioning tape as described by Mulligan. The 
subject’s	skin	was	examined	for	any	contraindication	
and	then	an	undertape	 was	applied.	With	subject	in	
supine position and ankle kept in neutral position, the 
tape was applied starting obliquely at the distal end 
Indian Journal of Physiotherapy and Occupational Therapy, January-March 2019, Vol.13, No. 1          99      
of	lateral	malleolus.	 While	a	pain	free	posterolateral-
superior glide was maintained at the distal end of 
fibula,	the	tape	was	then	wrapped	diagonal	and	around	
the tendo-achilles and ended at the medial side of 
lower leg 4-6. Post treatment, NPRS was noted and 
Weight	Distribution	 Squat	was	again	performed	 with	
the same procedure as mentioned above.

RESULTS
NPRS	and	Weight	distribution	 during	Squat	were	
noted immediately after the application of tape:

The results showed a 50% reduction in pain intensity 
immediately after application of the Mulligan Tape.Weight Distribution Squat:

The results showed that, Pre-treatment weight 
distribution at 0° Squat was more on the right side 
compared to the left side. Post treatment, this changed 
to normal weight distribution both on right and left side 
after application of tape. Important to note is that, at 30, 
60 and 90° squat, the percentage weight on the left side 
also increased to nearly 60% after application of tape. 
Also there was equal weight distribution seen on both 
the sides at all angles of squat after application of tape.
DISCUSSION
The	purpose	of	this	study	was	to	find	if	Mulligan	
taping	has	any	effect	on	improving	 the	weight	distribution	
during a functional activity in chronic ankle instability. 
Our results from this single case study showed that 
Mulligan taping not only reduces pain but also increases 
the	weight	distribution	 on	affected	side	and	nearly	equals	
the same bilaterally.
Taping has been proven to improve the neuromuscular 
proprioception	 and	hence	the	feedback	about	the	joint	
position and weight falling on it. Mulligan taping in 
turn corrects the positional fault thereby improving the 
alignment of the articular surfaces. This in turn may 
improve	again	the	weight	that	is	bound	to	fall	on	that	joint.	
Marjaan	Someeh	et	al	examined	the	influence	of	Mulligan	
     100      Indian Journal of Physiotherapy and Occupational Therapy, January-March 2019, Vol.13, No. 1
Ankle taping on functional performance in healthy athletes 
and athletes with chronic ankle stability. They found that 
Mulligan	Taping	significantly	 improved	 the	functional	
performance measured through 3 tests, more in the chronic 
ankle instability athletes. The authors support through this 
study that Mulligan taping corrects the positional fault of 
the	distal	fibula	that	is	commonly	 found	in	CAI	individuals. 	
Also, additional awareness of foot position and direction of 
motion by stimulation of mechanoreceptors through tape 
might also be one of the mechanisms of reducing pain and 
improving weight distribution.
Another study by the same authors examined 
the	immediate	 effects	of	mulligan	taping	on	postural	
control on athletes with and without CAI. They found 
that Mulligan taping improved the postural control 
significantly.	 In	our	study,	though	postural	control	was	not	
measured, improved weight distribution on any weight 
bearing	joint	will	in	turn	improve	the	postural	control.	
Better proprioception, external support, correction and 
maintenance	 of	fibula	positional	fault	and	better	postural	
control and weight distribution in turn will reduce the risk 
of	further	injury.	Hence	more	studies	are	further	required	
to examine these results on a general population.
CONCLUSION
This case study has documented that Mulligan 
Ankle Taping reduces pain and most important improves 
the weight distribution immediately. Further research is 
needed with a large sample to document the same results 
for a population.

INTRODUCTION
In	India	incidence	of	low	back	pain	(LBP)	has	been	
reported to be 23.9% and has a life time prevalence of 60- 
85%.	There	are	various	causes	of	low	back	pain(LBP)	
producing	 radicular	and	non-radicular	 symptoms.	 Low	
back	pain	(LBP)	is	a	common	disorder	involving	 the	
muscles, nerves, and bones of the back. Pain can vary 
from a dull constant ache to a sudden sharp feeling1. 
Chronic	low	back	pain	is	defined	by	pain	persisting	for	
more than 12 weeks2.	Adverse	neural	tension	is	defined	
as physiological or mechanical response produced when 
structures of the nervous system increases their normal movement3-5. Mechanically or chemically sensitize 
nerves show abnormal mechanosensitivity6.
Radiating	 low	back	pain	or	Lumbar	radiculopathy	
refers to the phenomenon in which the pain produced in 
the lumbar region radiates or travels down in one or both 
lower limbs with the presence of neural dysfunction. 
Radiating low back pain could be attributed to various 
causes such as compression of one or more nerve roots 
caused by a direct pressure from a herniated disc, 
degenerative changes in the lumbar spine that cause 
irritation of nerve roots, or sciatica due to compression 
of sciatic nerve roots, facetal hypertrophy that may DOI Number: 10.5958/0973-5674.2019.00020.0

compress the nerve root at the lateral foraminal exit , 
foraminal stenosis (narrowing of spinal canal through 
which the spinal nerve exits due to bone spurs or arthritis) 
–	more	common	in	elderly	adults,	diabetes,	nerve	root	
injuries,	scar	tissue	from	previous	spinal	surgery	that	is	
affecting	the	nerve	root7-9.
Neural mobilization has a great role in management 
of	radiculopathy	 and	low	back	pain	.	The	Straight	Leg	
Raise	(SLR)	test	is	frequently	 used	in	the	assessment	 of	
patients	presenting	 with	LBP.	Improving	 the	range	of	
SLR	has	a	beneficial	effect	in	storing	normal	movement	
and decreasing the degree of impairment due to low 
back disease 10.
There	is	no	formal	definition	of	lumbar	stabilization	
exercises , the approach is aimed at improving the 
neuromuscular control, strength, and endurance of the 
muscles that are central to maintaining the dynamic 
spinal	and	trunk	stability.	Group	of	muscles	particularly	
the	transversus	 abdominis	 and	lumbar	multifidius,	 also	
other paraspinal, abdominal, diaphragmatic, and pelvic 
muscles, lumbar stabilization exercise has been accepted 
as a more empiric therapeutic exercise method than 
any other exercise method. To improve spinal segment 
instability, lumbar stabilization exercises that strengthen 
the local muscle group located deep in the trunk around 
the lumbar vertebrae, which play an important role in 
providing dynamic stability for spinal segments, are 
useful for relieving functional disability of the spine. 
Lumbar	stabilization	 is	important	 for	maintaining	 the	
spine and performing extremity movements and is applied 
to	adjust	the	imbalance	 between	the	abdominal	 and	trunk	
extensor muscles. Such imbalance causes diseases in the 
lumbar vertebral region of the musculoskeletal system, 
which must be treated to prevent low back pain11.
Hence the rationale of the present study was to 
check	the	effectiveness	 straight	leg	raising	with	lumbar	
stabilization exercise in the treatment of low back pain 
with adverse neural tension.
AIM

Straight leg raise stretching: The	subject	is	in	supine	and	
relaxed in the center of the bed, with one pillow under the 
head.	Therapist	will	stand	at	the	affected	side	and	raised	
the side which is perpendicular to the bed in straight leg 
raise	test	with	one	hand	placed	under	the	ankle	joint	and	
the	other	hand	placed	on	the	knee	joints	until	either	pain	
in the back or referred pain to the leg is seen.
Figure 1: Straight leg raise stretching
Then the lower limb is taken down few degrees 
from this symptomatic point. The therapist will mobilize 
the sciatic nerve by gentle oscillations alternatively 
toward	ankle	dorsiflexion	 and	plantar	flexion	.	This	
sequences is repeated several times, in which the 
amplitude is increased according to the patient response. 
The technique progressed to a point where symptoms 
where resistance of the movement was encountered. As 
the pain is relieved, the therapist increase the range of 
motion until reaching the maximum range of straight leg 
raise with pain free. The position is held for 30seconds.
Frequency: 2 times week for 3 weeks
They were instructed to perform the stabilization 
exercises at home twice a day on the days they did not 
come for their treatment sessions. Each exercises were 
carried forward each week.

The	present	study	was	carried	out	to	see	the	effects	
of	Straight	Leg	Raise	With	lumbar	stabilization	 exercises	
in reducing pain, improving ROM and physical functions 
in	low	back	pain	subjects	with	adverse	neural	tension	
between the age groups of 20-50 years. This study included 
30	subjects	with	low	back	pain	of	both	genders.	Through	
convenient sampling they were recruited in the study.
V ARIABLE
Pain (NPRS), PSLR and Modified (ODI): On 
comparing score with paired t test, the p value obtained 
was	<0.05	which	implies	that	it	is	statistically	 significant	
.This	suggest	that	SLR	with	lumbar	stabilization	
exercises,	 had	an	effect	in	reducing	pain	improving	
ROM in patient with low back pain after 3 weeks of 
treatment. The result found in our study is accordance 
with	study	done	by	Neha	Malik,	Chitra	Kataria	(2012)	
on	Comparative 	Effectiveness	 of	Straight	Leg	Raise	and	
Slump	Stretching	 in	Subjects	with	Low	Back	Pain	with	
Adverse Neural Tension concluded that both techniques 
straight	leg	raise	and	slump	stretching	are	equally	effective	
in reducing pain in patients with low back pain with 
adverse neural tension12 .There are many physiological 
benefits	found	with	neural	mobilization	 that	reduces	
pain and improves ROM. In neural mobilization, there is 
oscillatory movement like straight leg stretching, there is 
elongation and shortening of the nerve which temporarily 
increases the intra neural pressure followed by a period 
of relaxation in between . This repeated pumping action 
enhance	dispersal	of	local	inflammatory	 products	in	and	
around the nerve, thus alleviating hypoxia and reducing 
pain.( Brown et ) investigated this and found an increase 
in	fluid	dispersion	 in	the	leg	has	been	found	secondary	 to	
repeated	ankle	plantarflexion	 and	dorsiflexion.	 (Dwornik	
et al 2009) said that neural mobilization gives high 
analgesic	effects	based	on	the	finding	that	the	resting	
muscle tone decreased post neural mobilization.
The result found in our study is according to Sahar 
M.	Adel(2011)	 on	the	Efficacy	of	Neural	Mobilization	
in	Treatment	 of	Low	Back	Dysfunctions	 concluded	 that	
straight	leg	raising	(SLR)	stretching	 may	be	beneficial	
in	the	management	 of	patients	with	LBD.	SLR	
stretching with lumbar spine mobilization and exercise 
was	beneficial	 in	improving	 pain,	reducing	short-term	
disability and promoting centralization of symptoms in 
this group of patients.
Among the abdominal muscles, the transverse 
abdominal	 abdominal,	 multifidus,	 and	internal	oblique

muscles help to increase the intra-abdominal pressure, 
thereby con-tributing to the spinal and pelvic stability 13. 
Our lumbar stabilization exercise group included some 
lumbar dynamic exercises, which may have strengthened 
the	lumbar	extensors	at	the	large	lumbar	flexion	angle.
Another study concluded that exercise 
programs	had	significant	 effect	on	the	patients	
with chronic low back pain. Back extension 
exercises	had	an	additional	 effect	in	enhancing	
the strength of the extensor muscles and also 
in increasing the mobility of the lumbar spine. 
This provides essential support for the spine 
and thereby decreasing the associated pain and 
disability. In the presence of strong core and 
back muscles, the possibility for low back pain 
is minimal. Thus lumbar extension as well as 
stabilization exercises are essential to strengthen 
the core and reduce low back related pain and 
disability in patients with chronic low back pain.

ABSTRACT
Obesity	is	defined	by	excessive	accumulation	 of	body	fat.	Obesity	is	an	individual	 to	develop	numerous	
comorbidities	 represents	 a	major	healthcare	 issues	in	many	countries	worldwide.	 This	study	is	to	evaluate	
the	Role	of	Physiotherapy	 in	Post	Bariatric	Surgery.	Bariatric	surgery	is	defined	as	surgery	on	the	stomach	
and/or intestine to help the person with extreme weight loss. Bariatric surgery is an option for people who 
have a body mass index above 40 kg/m2. Bariatric surgery is a surgery that is designed to lead to weight 
loss.	There	are	actually	four	different	types	of	bariatric	surgical	procedures	 that	can	be	done	to	help	patients	
achieve weight loss. These procedures will either shrink the stomach so that the patient can only eat small 
amounts of food at a time or will change the way that the digestive system can absorb the food the patient 
eats.  Patients need to meet a list of criteria before they will be considered candidates for bariatric surgery . 
The	physiotherapist	 supports	patients	to	optimise	fitness,	mobility,	and	weight	loss	prior	to	surgery	through	
motivational interviewing, collaborative goal-setting and physical activity. It has been seen that respiratory 
physiotherapy plays an important role in preventing complications post bariatric surgery. The role of 
physiotherapist	 in	this	process	is	essential,	individual	 therapeutic	 programs	help	to	adjust	all	the	aspects	
of training to the health status of the obese patient, with respect to coexisting diseases. Exercise is very 
important	it	helps	to	burn	calories,	get	rid	of	fat,	preserve	muscle	tissue,	protect	your	joints.	Aerobic	exercise	
and strength training will be included, as they both help in weight loss and weight control. Physiotherapist 
are	trained	to	create	safe	and	effective	physical	activities.	Chest	physiotherapy	 is	a	treatment	that	helps	to	
remove the excess secretions from inside the lungs, re-educate breathing muscle to try to improve ventilation 
of the lungs. Chest physiotherapy is a group of treatments which are designed to promote mucus extraction 
from	the	patient’s	respiratory	 system.	The	purpose	of	chest	physiotherapy,	 is	to	help	patient	breath	more	
freely and to get more oxygen into the body. Chest physical therapy includes postural drainage, chest 
percussion, chest vibration, turning, deep breathing exercises, and coughing.

INTRODUCTION
Bariatric surgery (weight loss surgery) includes a 
variety of procedures performed on people who have 
obesity.	Weight	loss	is	achieved	by	reducing	the	size	
of the stomach with a gastric band or through removal 
of a portion of the stomach (sleeve gastrectomy or 
biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch) or by 
resecting and re-routing the small intestine to a small 
stomach pouch (gastric bypass surgery) [1] Excessive fat accumulation around the heart 
may play an important role in the pathogenesis of 
cardiovascular diseases. Recent evidence has suggested 
that bariatric surgery results in relatively less decreases 
in epicardial fat compared with abdominal visceral fat 
and pericardial fat [23] . Bariatric surgery is a wonderful 
tool that helps patients with clinical obesity lose weight 
and gain their lives back [24]. Body mass index (BMI) is 
defined	as	the	weight	in	kilograms	 divided	by	the	square	
of the in meters (kg/m2). It provides a useful population-
level measure and obesity. BMI can be used to estimate 
prevalence of obesity within populations, as it is the 
same for sexes and for ages of adults [25] .
Exercise program after bariatric surgery provide 
further improvements in metabolic health, better 
functional capacity compared with surgery ‐induced Corresponding Author:

weight loss not alone, but there are many  more surgeries 
who induced weight loss for example ,
Gastric Sleeve: also	known	as	‘sleeve	gastrectomy’,	 is	
the	first	step	before	any	bariatric	surgery	and	can	also	
be a single standalone procedure. In this procedure, the 
surgeon creates a small stomach sleeve using a stapling 
device, and the rest of the stomach is removed [2].  
Gastric	Bypass:	Gastric	bypass	is	one	of	the	most	
common	weight	loss	procedures.	 Gastric	bypass	is	a	
well-researched procedure and remains one of the best 
weight loss methods, surgically. It is called as ‘The 
Roux-en	Y	Gastric	Bypass	(RYGB)’	and	is	considered	
as	the	‘gold	standard’ 	of	weight	loss	surgery	[2]. 
Gastric Banding: Gastric	Banding	is	a	laparoscopic	
surgery where a surgeon places a band around the upper 
end of the stomach dividing it into two parts to create a 
small pouch to hold food. The band limits the amount 
of food the patient can eat, which makes them feel full 
after a small amount of food. The small opening between 
the sections allows the food to pass, thereby making the 
patient feel full [2]. 
Bariatric surgery is a surgery that is designed to lead 
to	weight	loss.	There	are	actually	four	different	types	of	
bariatric surgical procedures that can be done to help 
patients achieve weight loss. These procedures will 
either shrink the stomach so that the patient can only eat 
small amounts of food at a time or will change the way 
that the digestive system can absorb the food the patient 
eats.  Patients need to meet a list of criteria before they 
will be considered candidates for bariatric surgery [3,4]. 
First, the patient has to be medically documented as 
being severely obese or have a medical condition related 
to being obese and have a BMI over 35. A patient is not 
considered severely obese until their BMI, (body mass 
index) is over 40 [3].
Second, the patient needs to have tried to lose 
weight by other means. This usually includes healthy 
eating, dieting, exercising and attempting to make other 
lifestyle changes that would promote weight loss [3]. 
Third, the patient will need to attend classes to 
understand how his or her body will react to the surgery 
and how he or she will need to make drastic lifestyle 
changes	so	that	the	surgery	will	be	effective	[3].
Physiotherapists can work in the prevention 
and management of obesity [5]. The physiotherapist contributes to a multi-disciplinary team, providing 
education on breathing and early mobility exercises [5]. 
The role of physiotherapist in this process is essential, 
individual	 therapeutic	 programs	help	to	adjust	all	the	
aspects of training to the health status of the obese patient, 
with respect to coexisting diseases. The physiotherapist 
supports	patients	to	optimise	fitness,	mobility,	and	
weight loss prior to surgery through motivational 
interviewing, collaborative goal-setting and physical 
activity prescription [5]. 
The role of physiotherapist in bariatric surgery, 
chest physiotherapy is a treatment that helps to remove 
the excess secretions from inside the lungs. It is used 
to assist a cough, re-educate breathing muscle to try to 
improve ventilation of the lungs [6].
Exercises after surgery, strength training exercises 
will increase the muscle tone, gives more balance and 
stable	posture	and	prevent	injuries	such	as	sprain	or	
fractures [7].	It	also	increases	a	muscle	bulk.	Warm-
ups and stretching activities are essential preparation 
for a strength training. Strength, resistance and weight 
training are aimed at improving the strength and function 
of muscles [8].
Cardio: Regular cardio aerobic exercise has a lot of 
benefits.	It	gives	more	energy	[7].
Flexibility:	 flexibility	training	is	a	crucial	component	
of	any	fitness	program.	This	type	of	training	helps	
to	enhance	the	range	of	motion	of	joints.	Preventing	
Injuries.	Flexibility	 training	is	important	 to	avoid	
injuring.	If	patient	feels	any	soreness	or	tightness	after	
bariatric	workout,	flexibility	 training	can	help.	At	the	
time	of	stretching	it’s	important	to	be	careful.	Take	each	
stretch	slowly	and	hold	it	for	ten	seconds–don’t	 bounce	
up and down [7].

found no evidence to support of the use of incentive 
spirometry (IS) in the prevention of pulmonary 
complications after upper abdominal surgery [9]. Another 
study done by Barbalho-Moulim et al 2011 it was 
     108      Indian Journal of Physiotherapy and Occupational Therapy, January-March 2019, Vol.13, No. 1
analyzed the preoperative as well as the postoperative 
with spirometry and maximum respiratory pressures, 
obtained negative results which had shown a decrease of 
the	flow	rates	on	both	pressures	[10].
Whereas,	according	 to	study	done	by	Eli	forti	et	al	
2009,	Effects	of	Chest	Physiotherapy	 on	the	Respiratory	
Function	of	Postoperative	 Gastroplasty	 conclusion	 came	
out as Patients prevent the reduction of pulmonary 
function also contributes to expiratory muscle strength [11]. 
Another	study	done	by	Luce	et	al	1980,	found	decreases	
in expiratory reserve volume, functional residual capacity 
(FRC) and tidal volume (TV), ventilation and perfusion 
or even shunts, causing subsequent hypoxemia in obese 
patients [11,12]. Rubinstein et al 1990 found limitations in 
respiratory	 flow	to	between	50%	and	75%	of	the	vital	
capacity in obese patients [13].
Study of Pre and Postoperative Physical Activity 
Counselling	 in	Bariatric	Surgery,	this	done	by	Wendy	
C	King.,	et	al	2013.	It	was	evidence	is	mounting	that	
increasing physical activity pre- to postoperatively and 
higher postoperative physical activity level are associated 
with greater weight loss, improved body composition, and 
improved	fitness	following	bariatric	surgery	 [14].
According to a study done by Deborah Josbeno., 
et al 2011, Physical Activity and Physical Function in 
Individuals Post bariatric surgery, Physical activity 
participation has been shown to increase following 
bariatric surgery, and this increase has been associated 
with	greater	weight	loss	success.	Weight	loss	induced	by	
bariatric surgery is moderately correlated with physical 
activity participation is consistent. physical activity 
plays an essential role in weight loss maintenance after a 
dietary intervention [15].
According	 to	a	study	done	by	Fu-Zong	Wu	et	al	2016,	
Differential	 Effects	of	Bariatric	Surgery	Versus	Exercise	
on Excessive Visceral Fat Deposits, it was evident that 
differential	 impacts	of	weight	loss	on	adipose	tissue	
of various locations after bariatric surgery or exercise 
program.	The	long-term	 effects	of	weight	loss	with	
bariatric	surgery	and	exercise	intervention	 on	different	
visceral adiposity. It demonstrates that both bariatric 
surgery and exercise program lead to larger percentage 
decrease in visceral fat compared with epicardial fat 
volume [16].
According	 to	this	study	Effects	of	preoperative	
inspiratory muscle training in obese women undergoing open bariatric surgery: respiratory muscle strength, lung 
volumes, and diaphragmatic excursion. Based on the 
results of this study, preoperative inspiratory muscles 
training	attenuates	 the	negative	effects	of	open	bariatric	
surgery in the inspiratory muscle strength [17].
While	Silva	et	al. concluded that respiratory muscle 
function was invariably damaged after open abdominal 
surgeries, the present study showed that pulmonary 
function and respiratory muscle strength were maintained 
in patients treated with CCP and those treated with 
CCP+TEDS 15 and 30 days after bariatric surgery, with 
special	emphasis	on	the	effect	of	 TEDS	on	MEP 	[18]. 
The amount of physical activity participation and the 
level of physical function are independently associated 
with	weight	loss	in	individuals	 2–5	years	after	bariatric	
surgery. This study has shown that physical function is 
not correlated with physical activity, which may suggest 
that the capacity to engage in physical activity does 
not necessarily translate into greater levels of activity 
participation [19,20,21].
CONCLUSION
From this study it can be concluded that, 
Bariatric surgery patients adopt an exercise routine 
after undergoing the procedure [22]. Develop and 
maintain a consistent exercise program to strengthen 
your heart and bones, burn calories, develop muscles, 
increase your metabolic rate, improve your mood and 
relieve stress. Exercising can also improve your blood 
sugar control. Exercise program after bariatric surgery 
provide further improvements in metabolic health, better 
functional capacity compared with surgery ‐induced 
weight loss. Moderate intensity exercise has been found 
to	be	effective	for	long ‐term weight control. Bariatric 
surgery improves insulin sensitivity and glycaemic 
control, which can be further enhanced when coupled 
with physical activity. Balance, muscular strength and 
endurance,	 flexibility	 and	cardiorespiratory	 endurance	
are	consistently	 improved	in	individual’s	 post ‐bariatric 
surgery as a result of exercises. These improvements 
lead to improved functional ability for activities of daily 
living and increased self ‐reported quality of life.

ABSTRACT
Background: 	Inadequate	 flexibility	within	the	posterior	thigh	compartment	 appears	to	be	one	of	the	more	
commonly	 accepted	causes	of	hamstring	 injuries.	Neurodynamics	 has	been	proposed	as	an	alternative	 to	
stretching	by	targeting	the	neural	system	rather	than	muscle	tissue.	There	are	different	methods	of	delivering	
neural mobilization, including “sliding” and “tensioning” technique.
Objective: 	To	determine	 the	effect	and	compare	the	effectiveness	 of	sciatic	nerve	Tensioners	 vs	Sliders	in	
short hamstring syndrome
Methodology: 	Experimental	 design,It	has	three	groups:	Group	A	–	Neurodynamic	 Tensioners	 (n	=	35),	
Group	B	–	Neurodynamic	 Sliders	(n	=	35)	and	Group	C	–	Control	(n	=	35),	age:	17	to	25	years,	both	genders,

Hamstring muscle group consist of four muscles, 
Long	head	of	Biceps	femoris,	Short	head	of	Biceps	
Femoris, Semitendinosus and Semimembranosus. 
Biceps femoris muscles occupy the lateral and 
semimembranosus, semitendinosus occupy the medial 
part of the thigh. Among these muscles except short 
head of biceps femoris all the other three muscles are 
Biarticular	or	twojoint	muscle1,2.Hamstring muscles helps in activities like walking 
and also helps in maintaining posture and balance.3,4 
Short hamstring syndrome is a common condition, which 
is caused by reduction in size of a muscle tissue length 
and leads to muscle strain / tear and restricted movement 
or	dysfunction.	 It	affects	all	the	age	groups	and	both	
in sports and occupation which requires more physical 
activity. The risks factors suggested in the literature 
are	poor	flexibility,	 neural	tension,	muscle	imbalances,	
fatigue	and	previous	history	of	injury.	In	specific	the	
poor	flexibility	 of	the	hamstring	 muscle	appears	to	be	
one	of	the	main	cause	of	hamstring	injury5,6.
Inadequate	 flexibility	 of	hamstrings	 was	always	
proposed	to	be	the	reason	of	frequent	injury.	But	lot	of	
research also contradict this concept7,8,9. But the nerve 
tension, tightness and immobility also is one of the main DOI Number: 10.5958/0973-5674.2019.00022.4 
Indian Journal of Physiotherapy and Occupational Therapy, January-March 2019, Vol.13, No. 1          111      
causes	in	hamstring	 flexibility	 and	hamstring	 injury.	
Nerve immobility may result in reduced muscle length. 
In presence of neural mechanosensitivity the protective 
muscle contraction occurs and it leads to hamstring 
tightness	predisposing	to	subsequent	strain	injury10,11,12.
The	hamstring	 flexibility	 is	commonly	 measured	
by	Passive	Straight	Leg	Raise	(PSLR)	and	Active	Knee	
Extension	 (AKE).Short	 hamstring	 syndrome	 quite	
commonly is treated by conventional physiotherapy 
treatment such as static stretching, dynamic stretching, 
proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation and 
myofascial release techniques. These techniques 
concentrates at increasing the range of motion indirectly 
there by assuming that it is lengthening the shortened 
tissue length i.e. musculoskeletal level. 
Nerve mobilization, evolving technique integrates 
both	musculoskeletal	 and	neural	structures	by	a	“flossing”	
of the nervous system to reduce pain and increase range 
of motion. It has two types: Tensioners and Sliders. The 
Neurodynamic Tensioners aim to mobilize a nerve by 
elongation of the nerve bed whereas the neurodynamic 
sliders aim to mobilize the combination of movements 
in	which	the	elongation	 of	the	nerve	bed	at	one	joint	and	
is simultaneously counterbalanced by a reduction in the 
length	of	the	nerve	bed	at	an	adjacent	joint.	The	Slider	
technique is less aggressive than tensioner technique13.
No studies had so far compared these two techniques 
over	its	effect	in	short	hamstring	syndrome.	 Furthermore	
due to the contradictory research documentation on 
the	effect	of	stretching,	 there	arises	a	need	to	compare	
these	neural	mobilization	 techniques	 for	the	benefit	of	
the patients. So the purpose of this study is to compare 
the	effects	of	Neurodynamic	 Sciatic	tensioners	 versus	
sliders in short hamstring syndrome.
METHODOLOGY
The study design was single blinded, experimental 
study and study type was pre and post type. Patient  
of	both	gender,	in	age	group	of	17	–	25	with	Passive	
Straight	Leg	Raise	and	Active	Knee	Extension	 less	than	
80*	were	included	in	the	study.	Patients	with	recent	
injuries,	fracture	to	spine,	femur	and	tibia,	neurological	
symptoms, spinal or lower limb deformity were excluded 
from	the	study.	75	subjects	who	had	satisfied	inclusion	
and exclusion criteria were randomly selected using 
lottery method. After obtaining the informed consent from	each	participant,	 the	subjects	are	divided	in	to	
three	groups.	Prior	and	after	the	intervention	 PSLR	and	
AKE	will	be	evaluated	by	the	other	therapist	who	had	
not treated the patient.
PROCEDURE
The	PSLR	and	AKE	will	be	measured	 in	the	
dominant leg by the two examiners and randomly 
divided	in	to	three	groups.	The	subjects	in	Group	A	
received	Neurodynamic	 tensioners,	 Group	B	received	
Neurodynamic	 sliders	and	the	Group	C	received	Passive	
mobilization	 of	intrinsic	foot	joints	for	10	repetitions.	
After	the	intervention	 again	the	PSLR	and	AKE	will	be	
measured to by the other two examiners. Here by the 
researchers were double blinded to the Pre and Post test 
of	PSLR	and	 AKE	measurements.	
Experimental Group:
Neurodynamic Tensioners (Group A):  In this group 
the	subjects	received	Neurodynamic	 Tensioners.	 The	
Procedure of this intervention was Patient has to be in 
sitting at the edge of the couch and hand held together 
behind back. The concurrent movement of the hip 
flexion,	knee	extension	 and	dorsiflexion	 followed	by	
cervical	and	thoracic	forward	flexion	altered	dynamically	
by	concurrent	 movement	 of	plantar	flexion,	knee	flexion	
and hip extension followed by cervical and thoracic 
extension/ neutral. This movement was done for 10 
repetitions in dominant leg.
Neurodynamic Sliders (Group B):  In this group the 
subjects	received	Neurodynamic	 Sliders.	The	procedure	
of this intervention was patient has to be half lying 
position.	The	concurrent	 movement	 of	hip	flexion,	knee	
flexion	and	dorsiflexion	 was	altered	dynamically	 by	
concurrent movement of hip extension, knee extension 
and	plantar	flexion.	This	movement	 was	for	10	repetitions	
in their dominant leg by researcher.
Control Group (Group c)
Passive mobilization of intrinsic foot joints:  In 
this	group	the	subjects	received  Passive mobilization 
of	intrinsic	foot	joints	i.e.	placebo	technique.	 This	
technique was chosen because of no relation in anatomic 
and physiological changes during hamstring muscles 
and sciatic nerve. This movement was done for 10 
repetitions in their dominant leg by researcher.

DISCUSSION
This	study	aims	to	compare	 the	effects	of	
Neurodynamic Sciatic tensioners versus sliders in short 
hamstring syndrome in which no research work had 
been done so far.
Decreased	 flexibility	 of	the	hamstring	 is	now	
proven	not	to	be	the	sole	cause	of	hamstring	 injury	and	
it	was	suggested	 to	be	just	one	of	the	reason	for	getting	
hamstring strain14,15.Magnusson proposed “sensory 
theory” where he proposed the idea that the increase 
in	muscle	flexibility	 post	stretching	 is	due	to	modified	
sensation or altered perception to stretch or pain16.
The result of this study shows that there was a 
significant	 difference		 in	passive	knee	extension	 test		
Indian Journal of Physiotherapy and Occupational Therapy, January-March 2019, Vol.13, No. 1          113      
and	Active	knee	extension	test	in	Group	A	and	Group	B	
subjects(P<0.05)	(Table	1).
This	goes	in	hand	with	Dabholkar	 Tejashree	who	
concluded that Neural mobilization techniques was 
effective	in	improving	agility	of	lower	extremity
Jaemyoung Park  who suggested that neurodynamic 
sciatic nerve sliding technique improves hamstring 
flexibility	and	postural	balance17,18. 
The improvement in passive knee extension can be 
justified	by	that	neural	mechanosensitivity	 is	increased	
when the nerve gets adherent and as a consequence there 
occurs a protective contraction of hamstrings in short 
hamstring syndrome. This neural mobilisation decrease 
neural mechanosensitivity and thus improve the range 
of motion19.Certain studies also document that neural 
mobilisation	has	autonomic	effects.
The results of this study shows that there exist 
a	statistically	 significant	 difference	 among	three	
groups(p<0.05)	 and	on	analysis	Group	B	treated	with	
Neurodynamic	 Sciatic	Sliders	showed	a	beneficial	
result	than	Group	A	treated	with	Neurodynamic	 Sciatic	
Tensioners.
This can be better explained by the fact that Sliding 
techniques involves the  combinations of movements 
that	result	in	elongation	 of	the	nerve	bed	at	one	joint,	
while	reducing	the	length	of	the	nerve	bed	at	an	adjacent	
joint.	These	have	a	biomechanical	 effect	on	nervous	
system and are less aggressive than tension technique. 
Here the improvement is obtained by slowly improving 
the distance between two ends of nerve and also the 
comfort of the patient in this technique is  better than 
the other.
So this study recommends the use of sliders form 
of neural mobilisation technique in short hamstring 
syndrome	 for	the	benefit	of	the	patient.	Future	studies	
can be done in comparing the two type of neural 
mobilisation	 in	other	nerves	in	body	and	long	term	effect	
can be documented.
CONCLUSION
Sliders are better than Tensioners in neural 
mobilization	 techniques	 among	subjects	with	short	
hamstring syndrome. Being less aggressive, Sliders were 
comfortable	 and	more	beneficial	 with	less	pain	to	the	patients, Hence this study recommends the use of sliders 
in short hamstring syndrome for betterment of the patients.

ABSTRACT
Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation (PNF) is an approach to therapeutic exercise that combines 
functionally based diagonal patterns of movement with techniques of neuromuscular facilitation to evoke 
motor responses and improve neuromuscular control and function. The PNF approach gives the therapist a 
variety of manual resistance exercise techniques to increase muscle strength, to promote dynamic stability 
and	controlled	 mobility	as	the	foundation	 and	in	preparation	 for	initiation	of	task	specific	skilled	movements	
in a rehabilitation program.
This	case	study	was	intended	to	find	out	the	improvements	 on	balance	and	gait	ability	in	a	patient	with	Right	
Hemiparesis	following	Left	Middle	Cerebral	 Artery	(MCA)	territory	stroke	treated	with	PNF.
A case of right Hemiparesis following left middle cerebral artery lesion treated conservatively and referred 
for rehabilitation to our center. He had impaired weight bearing symmetry; impaired balance; impaired 
voluntary	motor	control.	He	was	assessed	with	Berg	Balance	Scale,	Fugl-Meyer	 Scale	–	lower	extremity	
component and Functional Ambulation Category and Balance Master. He received PNF therapy for 30 days 
(5 days a week for 6 weeks). Following which he improved in the balance ability and independence in gait.

Stroke is a global health care problem leading to 
significant	 mortality	and	morbidity.	 Despite	gains	made	
with	rehabilitation,	 balance	and	gait	deficits	remain	at	
discharge (1). Improvement in balance has been shown to 
be the most important determinant for regaining gait as 
measured with the Functional Ambulation Categories(2). 
Effective	 interventions	 are	needed	for	improving	
physical functioning and quality of life among survivors 
of stroke.Proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) 
is an approach to therapeutic exercise that combines 
functionally based diagonal patterns of movement with 
techniques of neuromuscular facilitation to evoke motor 
responses and improve neuromuscular control and 
function. The use of PNF patterns and positions suggests 
a stronger sensory excitation at the cortical level leading 
to increased number and improved threshold of motor 
neurons which could result in improved range of motion, 
strength and balance reactions(3).
Case presentation: 	The	present	case	is	a	48	year	old	
male is a right handed, non smoker, non alcoholic, with 
normal	sleep	and	bowel	&	bladder	pattern.	He	sustained	
a	Left	Middle	Cerebral	Artery	ischemic	stroke	in	the	
capsuloganglionic region resulting in hemiparesis of 
right side of the body with aphasia.
At the time of initial assessment he was conscious, 
oriented, obeying commands. He was mesomorphic. 
Sitting	with	protracted	 shoulder	and	lateral	flexed	trunk;

positive in right lower limb. Associated reactions were 
positive	when	tested	in	supine	for	Ramiste’s	 and	Limb	
synkinesis.	 Myotatic	reflex	(Wexler’s	 Reflex	grading)	
were	1+	-	triceps	and	ankle	jerk	3+	-	quadriceps	 and	
biceps	jerk.	His	postural	and	balance	control	were	poor.	
Hand functions such as reach, grasp and release were 
absent. He was dependent in activities such as lying to 
sitting, sitting to standing, standing and walking.
His Scandinavian Stroke scale which measures the 
severity of stroke was 22 (severe stroke), Functional 
Independence Score was 41 (dependent) and 
Brunnstrom’s	 stage	of	stroke	recovery	is	stage	1.	The	
initial	assessment	 taken	was	Weight	bearing	symmetry	
in lower limb (assessed using Balance Master SD), Berg 
Balance Scale, Functional Ambulation Scale, Fugl-
Meyer lower extremity component.
He was treated with Proprioceptive Neuromuscular 
Facilitation (PNF) intervention  consisting of D1 Flexion-
adduction; Extension-Abduction pattern for left lower 
limb which was resisted. Rhythmic initiation technique 
was given for the right lower limb and with improvements 
in voluntary motor control it was done with Combination 
of isotonics and Dynamic reversal. Pelvic bridging was 
done with combination of isotonics technique; pelvic 
diagonal patterns emphasizing anterior elevation and 
posterior depression were practiced. Chopping and 
lifting pattern was done is sitting. Rhythmic stabilization 
and stabilizing reversal for upper trunk in half standing 
position	with	the	affected	lower	extremity	 in	weight	
bearing. Bilateral reciprocal asymmetrical pattern for 
arm in standing was started once the strength in the 
upper limb and lower limb improved to promote bearing 
in	the	affected	lower	extremity.	 D1	flexion	abduction	
pattern for right upper limb was done with endpoint 
approximation to facilitate and activate right gluteus 
medius in standing. All these activities were done for 10 
repetitions with rest time as needed by the patient.
Gait	training	with	approximation	 given	through	the	
hips in the stance phase to promote weight bearing in the 
affected	lower	limb	for	15	minutes	was	done.	
He attended rehabilitation for 30 session (6 days a 
week for 5 weeks) lasting about one and a half hour per 
day. Post test score was taken using the same outcome 
measures after 30 sessions.DISCUSSION
The results of this study demonstrated that the 
PNF	interventions	 have	significant	 effect	on	balance	
and	gait.	The	findings	show	that	the	working	speed	has	
a	significant	 effect	on	the	functional	 mobility	in	stroke	
patient. Improvement in lower limb motor recovery 
was more accelerated. This is attributed to the pelvic 
PNF	patterns.	The	findings	of	this	study	correlated	 with	
findings	of	Wang	(1994)	which	stated	that	pelvic	PNF	is	
effective	in	activating	 the	Lower	abdominal	 and	trunk	
muscles	more	effectively	in	acute	stage (4).
Berg	Balance	scores	improved	 from	4	to	48,	this	
might be attributed the trunk and abdominal muscle 
activation achieved with stabilizing reversal and 
rhythmic	stabilization	 in	half	standing	position.	Fugl	–	
Meyer lower limb motor component improved from 4 
(reflex	activity)	to	24	(volitional	 control	&	improved	
coordination).	 Weight	bearing	symmetry	 in	Balance	
Master	improved	 from	ratio	of	10:90	to	48:52	with	
improvement in hip abductor strength. Stance phase 
weight	bearing	of	the	affected	leg	improved	 with	hip	
abductor activation preventing pelvic asymmetry and 
compensatory lateral tilt of trunk. This was similar to 
the	findings	of	Hufschmidt	 (1982)	and	Kawahira	et.	al.,	
(2004) were muscle torque generation in lower limb 
improved with resisted PNF patterns (5, 6). 
Ankle	dorsiflexion	 though	not	attained	full	range	the	
partial range facilitated ground clearance and improved 
plantar	flexion	momentum	 facilitated	 gait	speed.	The	
patient attained a walking speed of 0.35 m/sec which was 
similar	to	the	findings	of	Elizabeth	(2006)	and	Kwerkkel.	
G	(2002)	where	in	the	gait	kinematics	 improved	with	
repeated PNF training for 5days a week for 3 weeks (7). 
Functional Ambulation Category scale improved 
from 1 to 5 with patient able to walk in level surface 
independently.	 This	was	similar	to	the	findings	of	Kumar	
et. al., (2012) and stated good functional outcomes in 
rehabilitation (8).

Maintaining and improving sleep quality is an 
important clinical issue in modern life. Poor sleep 
quality is common among students due to academic work burden and social norms. The main cause behind 
poor	sleep	quality	includes	alcohol	and	caffeine	intake,	
stimulants and technology3. Sleep has two phases 
namely: non rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye 
movement (REM). NREM consists of four stages: stages 
1, 2, 3 and 4. Stages 3 and 4 are referred to collectively 
as	slow	wave	sleep	(SWS)	as	both	exhibits	a	slow	wave	
EEG	pattern.4 On average, one night of sleep involves 
four	or	five	sleep	cycles.	Sleep	cycles	are	the	progression	
through various stages of NREM sleep and REM sleep, 
each lasting close to 90 minutes5.
Physical	fitness	is	the	ability	to	achieve	certain	
performance standards for physical activity, and is an 
outcome of habitual physical activity or exercise1, 2. DOI Number: 10.5958/0973-5674.2019.00024.8 
Indian Journal of Physiotherapy and Occupational Therapy, January-March 2019, Vol.13, No. 1          119      
Higher level of physical activity decreases mortality 
rate by lowering the rate of cardiovascular diseases and 
cancer.6-7.	Evaluating	 the	physical	fitness	among	young	
adults and late adolescence is relevant because low 
levels	of	fitness	may	underlie	the	potential	for	several	
health problems in later adulthood8,	9.
The case for exercise and physical health is now 
widely accepted by medical authorities across the 
world10, 11. Sedentary living doubles the risk of morbidity 
and mortality from coronary heart disease and stroke14, 
15 which is comparable with the risk associated with 
hypertension and hyperlipidaemia and not far behind 
that	of	smoking.	Low	activity	levels	leads	to	obesity,	
diabetes and some cancer.14The incidence of inactivity 
is also high in many developed countries where 
technology is slowly removing exercise from lifestyles 
and is estimated at around 40% of the middle aged and 
elderly	in	the	UK15.The burden of inactivity is expensive 
and improvement can be done by activity promotions17.
Relation between sleep and memory is growing area 
of	research	in	field	of	neuroscience.	 Recent	researches	
have	shown	that	different	stages	of	sleep	have	some	
beneficial	 effect	on	memory18.	Memory	is	defined	as	
ability to encode, consolidate and remember information 
that has been learnt. 19It can be categorized on the basis 
of whether the information is received from conscious 
or subconscious, the former termed declarative (or 
explicit) memory and the latter termed non-declarative 
(or implicit) memory.18,	20
  In the process of encoding, new information inputs 
into neural circuits. This information is unstable and must 
be strengthened and transferred to long-term storage in 
the	process	of	consolidation,	 which	this	project	will	
focus on. Finally, this information is retrieved from the 
areas of storage.21  
A person spends more than 1/3rd of his life sleeping. 
Sleeping	is	the	best	way	of	recharging	 one’s	body.	
Today’s	fast	growing	industrialized	 world	and	rapid	
advancement in digital technology, multimedia; internet 
and	social	networking	 lifestyle	have	greatly	affected	the	
lifestyle of the people in the world population. The youth 
are	the	most	affected	by	these	advancements.	 It	also	
affects	their	lifestyle	especially	 their	sleep	timing	and	
quality.	These	technologies	 are	effecting	duration	and	
quality of sleep, because of this other parameters like 
their	physical	activity	and	memory	are	also	affected.	The	significance	 of	this	finding	is	that	key	measures	of	poor	
sleep quality may be associated with physical activity 
downfall and memory issues among young adults.
MATERIAL AND METHOD
100	subjects	between	age	group	18-25	years	were	
selected for the study on the basis of inclusion and 
exclusion criteria. After selection they were made to sign 
informed consent.
Inclusion Criteria: Subjects	both	male	and	female	
with	normal	BMI	between	age-groups	 18-25	years,	
comprehending English language were taken.
Exclusion Criteria: Subjects	 who	will	indulge	
in strenuous physical activity, having history of 
any of these following disease- Musculoskeletal 
disorders, Neurological disorder, Psychiatric disorder, 
cardiovascular disease, Trauma, Surgery were included 
in exclusion criteria.
Study Design: Correlational study
Outcomes Measures: Pittsburgh sleep quality index, 
Baecke physical activity questionnaire, Memory 
functioning questionnaire
Procedure: The	study	was	conducted	 to	find	out	the	
correlation of memory and physical activity with sleep 
quality.	The	subjects	participated	 were	screened	to	
rule	out	inclusion	and	exclusion	 criteria.	The	subjects	
fulfilling	both	criteria	were	asked	to	sign	informed	
consent.	After	signing	informed	consent	the	subjects	
were given the data collection form which comprises 
demographic	 details,	subjective	 assessment,	 PSQI,	
BPAQ	and	MFQ	
The	subjects	filled	those	details	and	answered	the	
question according to their ability and perception.
The	Pittsburgh	 Sleep	Quality	Index	(PSQI)	is	
used to measure quality and pattern of sleep. It shows 
difference	 in	poor	and	good	sleep	by	measuring	 seven	
domains	namely:	subjective	 sleep	quality,	sleep	latency,	
sleep	duration,	 habitual	sleep	efficiency,	 and	sleep	
disturbances, use of sleep medication, and daytime 
dysfunction over the last month. Each of seven areas of 
sleep was rated by client himself/herself. Scoring of the 
answers	is	based	on	a	0	to	3	scale,	whereby	3	reflect	the	
negative	extreme	on	the	Likert	Scale.		A	global	sum	of	
“5”or greater indicates a “poor” sleeper. 
     120      Indian Journal of Physiotherapy and Occupational Therapy, January-March 2019, Vol.13, No. 1
Baecke Physical Activity questionnaire includes a 
total	of	16	questions	classified	into	three	domains:	work,	
sports, and non-sports leisure activity. Each domain has 
several	questions	with	scoring	on	five	point	scale,	ranging	
from never to always or very often. Scoring was done 
according to original system in which work was the mean 
score in which work is the mean score for occupational 
questions, sports for sports-related questions and non-
sports leisure for physical activities during leisure time. 
Each	domain	could	receive	a	score	from	one	to	five	points,	
thus	allowing	a	total	score	from	three	(minimum)	 to	fifteen	
(maximum). For the two most frequently reported sports 
activities,	 specific	questions	regarding	 the	number	of	
months per year and hours per week of participation were 
addressed.	 The	original	BQ	was	translated	into	Japanese	
using the forward and backward translation procedure. 
Two professional translators independently translated the 
original scale once.
The	Memory	Functioning	 Questionnaire	 (Zelinski	
et	al.,	1980),	on	the	other	hand,	is	narrower	in	scope.	
It	consists	of	92	items	requiring	7-point	Likert	scale	
judgments	 on	various	aspects	of	everyday	remembering	
and	forgetting.	 Responses	 to	the	MFQ	are	summarized	
in	nine	a	priori	scale	scores:	General	Rating	of	Memory,	
Reliance on Memory, Retrospective Functioning, 
Frequency of Forgetting, Frequency of Forgetting 
When	Reading,	Remembering	 Past	Events,	Seriousness	
of	Memory	Failures,	Mnemonics	 Usage,	and	Effort	to	
Remember
FINDINGS AND DISCUSSION
Analysis was performed using statistics SPSS Version 
21. The association between sleep quality, physical activity 
and	memory	was	found	out	by	Karl	Pearson	correlation 	
coefficient	 (r).Non-significant	 correlation	 was	found	
between	MFQ	and	PSQI.	Non-significant	 correlation	 was	
found	between	BPAQ	and	PSQI

consideration can never omit doing physical activity 
as a whole because the college students have to go 
to	their	colleges	and	the	office	workers	have	to	go	to	
earn bread and butter for themselves. This was a cross 
sectional	study,	if	subjects	are	called	for	a	longer	period	
for	a	longitudinal	 study,	effect	of	sleep	quality	may	be	
seen	on	physical	activity.	This	effect	may	be	for	a	longer	
duration	sleep	deprived	subjects.
To clarify the relationship between sleep quality and 
physical activity in young population, this study made 
an attempt to explore the association between sleep 
quality and physical activity. These relationships imply 
that	sleep	quality	will	have	no	significant	 relation	with	
physical activity.
The group in our study had a high motivation level 
and	enjoy	more.	They	have	a	more	positive	attitude	
towards life. Energy metabolism is greater. They are 
generally disease free. They have higher strength, 
endurance	and	flexibility.
Only few studies were there who investigated relation 
between physical activity and sleep 22-25. Studies conducted 
on adult population show poor sleep at night along with 
lower levels of physical activity 25. Physical activity 
predicting sleep that night was less consistent. Two studies 
found no relation between daily physical activity and 
subsequent sleep22, 25. There are numerous factors that may 
contribute to the inconsistencies in the few studies conducted 
to	date	including	differences	 in	the	exercise	protocols	
studied, such as the intensity and duration of programs, 
and their interactions with individual characteristics such 
as	fitness,	age,	and	gender26.	Questions	 remain	over	the	
sleep	and	health	benefits	associated	with	specific	levels	of	
physical activity (light, moderate, vigorous) and at what 
combinations	 or	thresholds,	 and	differences	 in	effects	
across individuals and across the lifespan. Such nuanced 
information is needed in order to tailor recommendations 
to promote optimal health.
Sleep with Memory: There is no clear explanation 
about	which	stage	of	sleep	is	most	important.	 Different	
sleep stages are dependent on each other. Stage 2 
of NREM sleep and REM sleep may have a role in 
semantic memory consolidation. Studies show that REM 
increases procedural memory. There is lack of evidence 
regarding interaction between individual sleep stages 
and conditioning memory.

The group taken into consideration may not have 
a	memory	problem	because	younger	group	of	subjects	
were included. The lack of interference during sleep has 
been	considered 	as	a	possible	cause	of	the	no	effects	of	
sleep on memory. Young adults have high amounts of 
slow wave sleep and sleep in general, there is no brain 
degeneration and their attention level is also high. The 
group	included	all	college	going	students	i.e.	subjects	
were with lesser memory issues.
One research revealed that quality of sleep is not 
related	to	memory	in	an	individual’s	 life.27The results 
found in the present study do not coincide to a study 
conducted	 by	Murre,	Kristo,	&	Janssen	(2014)	found	
that sleep quality measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep 
Quality	Questionnaire	 was	associated	 with	poorer	
autobiographical memory performance 4-6 weeks after 
the recorded event.
CONCLUSION
With	the	result	of	present	study	it	could	be	established	
that sleep deprivation or impaired sleep quality has no 
effect	on	physical	activity	and	memory	in	young	adults.

Professional players have an advantage over 
Immature players in terms of body composition and 
shape, speed, endurance, agility, control, perception 
of anxiety, anticipation, and technical skill. Of all 
these, agility, speed  and anticipation skills seem to 
be the strongest predictors of talent.1 The Speed and 
acceleration are important qualities in outdoor sports, 
with running quickly over short distances for success2,3  
In Soccer  players Although high-speed actions 
contribute only about 11% to that of  total distance 
covered, it  plays  more crucial and important role in 
moments of the game and contribute directly to winning 
possession of the ball as well as scoring  or to conceding 
of goals.4  Agility	does	not	have	a	global	definition,5 but Narasimhan	 et	al.	(2006)	defined	agility	as	the	ability	
to	efficiently	 change	operating	 states	in	response	to	
uncertain and changing demands placed upon it. Many 
Outdoor and Indoor sports involve straight sprinting, 
rather than straight sprinting more often repeated short 
sprinting with changes of direction. Attaining a high 
sprint velocity over a short distance is of very important 
for	better	performance	 in	team	and	in	field	of	sports.6  
Considering this sports  it would seem important to 
provide testing and training that mimics this demand to 
increase	specificity.	 The	test	which	is	most	commonly	
used for testing speed and agility in athletes is Shuttle 
Run test. Sprints most frequently occur over very short 
distances	 (0–10	m)	from	both	standing	and	rolling	
starts.	Consequently,	 the	speed	over	the	first	steps	and	
the ability to accelerate quickly would be considered 
of	greater	importance	 in	the	field	of	sports7,8		Speed and 
agility	are	important	 qualities	in	the	field	sports	for	
better performance and is an important topic of research 
that has not been adequately investigated  across  a 
particular age group or level of competition. In fact, 
this data can be turned into valuable information on the 
unique physiological demands in athletes. Additionally, 
this	test	can	effectively	 guide	physiotherapists	 for	DOI Number: 10.5958/0973-5674.2019.00025.X

conditioning and training programs across a season and 
can	also	help	them	understand	 the	differences	 in	fitness,	
between players. Hence, the present research emphasize 
on	the	need	to	find	a	common	value	of	Shuttle	run	test	in	
athletes of Belagavi.
METHOD
Ethical clearance was obtained from the 
Institutional	 Ethical	Committee	 of	KAHER	Institute	of	
Physiotherapy, 162 participants were recruited in the 
study	after	fulfillment	 of	eligibility	 criteria.	A	written	
informed consent was obtained from all the participants 
before the commencement of the study. The participants 
included were from the various institutes and sports 
academies in and around Belagavi city. Demographic 
characteristics of the participant, including their age, 
gender, Sports and years of playing were noted. Athletes 
within	the	age	group	of	18-25	year	of	age	both	male	and	
female who were willing to participate were included in 
the study. Participants were excluded if there were any 
musculoskeletal problems such as fracture, sprain/strain 
of lower limb in the past 6 months, existing neurological, 
respiratory or cardio vascular problems or any other 
condition leading to limitation in 10 meters shuttle run 
test performance.
Procedure: 	After	finding	their	suitability	 as	per	the	
inclusion criteria participants were briefed about the 
nature of the study and the intervention in their vernacular 
language. Only those participants who are willing to 
participate	 were	recruited	in	the	study.	The	subjects	were		
grouped into three strata according to age and gender. 
A		Warm–up	 session	for	10	min	was	given	to	all	the	
athlete	which	involved	5	min	jogging	and	5	min	dynamic	
exercises	for	all	joints.	All	participants	 were	given	with	1	
practice trial of shuttle run test for better understanding 
about test and they were allowed to ask questions if any 
doubts. After that, athlete stood in the starting position 
with	his	feet	slightly	apart.	On	the	command	of	Go	athlete	
was then asked to  touch cone at the starting line and sprint 
to touch cone on end line and sprints back to starting line 
which are 9.14 m (30 ft) apart.13
The stopwatch was used to record time taken by 
athlete to complete the test. The test was repeated 3 
time  and the therapist noted down the best time taken to 
complete the test.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
The statistical analysis was done by using SPSS 
version 21 software. Correlation between BMI, speed and number of years played with best time was analysed using 
Karl	Pearson’s	correlation	coefficient	method.	Comparison 	
of	male	and	females	with	mean	best	time,	mean	of	first	and	
second attempts speed score, mean number of years played 
and BMI were analysed using t test.

DISCUSSION
This study was conducted at belagavi on young 
athletes	with	a		goal	to	find	a	common	value	of	10	meters	shuttle run test in athletes. The secondary goal was to 
set a concrete data which would prove as a baseline 
for all the other studies that would involve designing 
rehabilitation	 or	fitness	protocol	for	belagavi		athletic	
population.	 Turgut	Kaplan	Et.al	Conducted	 a	study	on	
running speed and agility performance in professional 
and amateur soccer players, where 10 X 5 meter  shuttle 
run test was used. The study concluded that professional 
soccer players running speed and agility performances 
were higher than amateur soccer players.14 Another 
study	done	by	germa	nvicente-	rodri	guez	Et.al	to	find	
out reliability of stopwatch for measuring time taken 
to complete 4 X 10 meter shuttle run test and 30 meter  
shuttle run test and the result of this study suggested that 
stopwatch is a reliable and valid instrument for recording 
the time taken to complete the shuttle run test.15 In the 
present study also stopwatch has been used to record the 
best time taken to complete the 10 meters shuttle run test. 
In this present study total 162 participants were included 
with mean age of 20.31 with SD age 2.07 for males and 
20.28	with	SD	age.	In	the	present	study		three	trial	of	
10 m shuttle run test was taken so as to avoid human 
error and also to record the best time of athlete and the 
results are consistent with the results of the old study. In 
     126      Indian Journal of Physiotherapy and Occupational Therapy, January-March 2019, Vol.13, No. 1
conclusion, in the present study, we found overall speed 
range for 10 meter shuttle run test in belagavi athletes is 
between  9.00-12.70 min/sec. Male athlete speed range 
is  between 9.00-12.70 min/sec, female athletes  speed 
range is between 9.00-12.50 min/ sec. Mean best time 
for males was 10.69 min/sec It is also seen that there 
is positive correlation between the best time taken to 
complete the 10 meters shuttle run test and the age of 
the athletes. But there was no correlation between best 
time taken to complete test was compared with Body 
Mass Index and Numbers of years of play. The total 162 
participants were included in present study, in which 
21 samples fell under excellent category , 105 samples 
fell under good category and 36 samples fell under poor 
category of best time to complete the test. The Common 
value of 10 meter shuttle run test  for males excellent 
time,	good	time	and	poor	time	was	within	range	of	9.00	–	
9.82	sec,	9.83	–	11.56	sec	,	11.57	–	12.70	sec	respectively	
and	for	females	it	was	9.40	–	10.14	sec,10.15	–	11.83	sec	
and	11.84	–	12.50	sec	respectively.
CONCLUSION
This study concluded that the common value for 10 
meters shuttle run  test was within range of 9.00 -12.70 
sec for both male and females, were in both genders  
male athletes showing better performance.
Limitation: 	Generalizations	 of	the	sample	collected	
is questionable  as the sample collected may not be 
representing the  total population.
Practical Applications:  The result of the present 
study can be used as a reference for speed and agility 
performance	 test	(10	m	shuttle	run	test	)	&	by	fitness	
professionals for training purpose for belagavi athletes.

Background: The prevalence of stroke in the general population varies from 40 to 270 per 1000,000 in 
India. Approximately 12% of all strokes occur in those older than 40 years. Stroke may require a variety of 
rehabilitation services. One of them Mirror therapy is a simple, inexpensive and most importantly patient 
directed treatment that may improve hand function after stroke. 
Objective: To	assess	the	effectiveness	 of	mirror	therapy	on	upper	extremity	 functioning	 among	stroke	
patients at selected neuro- rehabilitation centres
Method: A	quantitative	 research	approach	 was	used	in	this	study.	Research	 design	was	Quasi-
experimental: pre-test post-test. Sample size was 50 post stroke patients who receive stroke rehabilitation 
at	Neurorehabilitation	 centres.	The	25	subjects	were	randomly	divided	into	two	groups,	experimental	 group	
and control group. The experimental group has received mirror therapy with the conventional therapy for 3 
days in a week for 4 weeks. Other side the control group has received only conventional therapy for 4 weeks, 
and	3	days	in	a	week.	 The	effectiveness	was	evaluated	by	Modified	Brunnstrom’s	motor	function	test	
Result: An	average	hand	functioning	 score	in	pre-test	was	8.2	which	increased	to	12.6	in	post-test	and	7.6	
which increased to 13.4 in post-test for upper extremity functioning among experimental group, following 
for	the	control	group	as	in	pre-test	an	average	was	8.3	which	increased	to	11.2	for	hand	and	8.1	which	
increased to 11.7 of upper extremity.
Conclusion: The	findings	of	the	study	show	that	there	is	significant	 difference	 between	the	scores	of	
experimental and control group.

INTRODUCTION
As human, we move our bodies to explicit our wants, 
needs, emotions, thoughts, and ideas. Basically, how 
well we move- and how much we move- decides how 
well we engage with the world and make our full purpose 
in life. Mostly the active movement helps us in function 
completely, interact with the world, feel well physically 
and emotionally, connect and build relationship with 
others, and communicate and express ourselves. Also 
the	movement	 helps	us	recover	if	our	brain	is	injured	
or	inflamed.	Body	movements	 are	comparable	 important	
for	smooth	and	effective	day	to	day	activities.1
Nervous system is a one of the system of our body, 
which perform all the sensory and motor function of body. The reason a healthy nervous system is so 
important	 is	because	it’s	what	runs	everything	 in	our	
body.	When	nervous	system	is	functioning	 correctly,	
body is able to perform all the things it needs to do. 
However, when the nervous system is compromised, or 
not	working	efficiently,	body	begins	to	break	down.2
Stroke is the third biggest killer in India after heart 
attack	and	cancer	and	is	a	major	public	health	concern.1 
Stroke	occurs	when	there	is	(1)	lack	of	blood	flow	to	a	
section of brain or (2) haemorrhage into the brain that 
results in death of brain cells. The predominance of stroke 
in the population varies from 40 to 270 per 1000,000 in 
India. Approximately 12% of all strokes occur in those 
older	than	40	years.	It	was	projected	that	by	2015	the	
number of cases of stroke would be increase to 1666,372 DOI Number: 10.5958/0973-5674.2019.00026.1 
Indian Journal of Physiotherapy and Occupational Therapy, January-March 2019, Vol.13, No. 1          129      
in the country. A predicted 5.7 million people died from 
stroke	in	2005	and	it	is	projected	that	these	deaths	would	
rise to 6.5 million by 2015.3
Impact on daily life, 4 out of 10 stroke survivors 
leave hospital requiring help with daily living activities 
but almost a third receive no social service visits. Around 
a third of stroke survivors experience depression after 
their stroke.4
15	million	people	suffer	from	stroke	worldwide	 each	
year. Of these, 5 million die and another 5 million are 
permanently	 DISABLED.5Ischemic stroke 10% in 30 
days, 23% in 1 year and 52 % in 5 year. Same as Intra-
cerebral haemorrhage 52% in 30 days, 62% in 1 year 
and 70% in 5 years. The sub-arachnoid haemorrhage 
was	45%	in	30	days,	48%	in	1	year	and	52	%	in	5	years.	
They also concluded that this prevalence of stroke may 
increase till 2020. Stroke patient may require a variety of 
rehabilitation services like physiotherapy, occupational 
therapy, speech therapy etc. One of them MIRROR 
THERAPY is an inexpensive, simple and patient 
directed treatment. The principle of mirror therapy is use 
of	a	mirror	to	create	a	reflective	illusion	of	an	affected	
limb in order to trick the brain into thinking movement 
has occurred without pain. 5
METHODOLOGY
A quantitative research approach was used in this 
study.	Research	design	was	Quasi-experimental:	 pre-test	
post-test. Content validity was obtained by experts of 
medical surgical nursing and physiotherapy opinion. Tool 
reliability	(0.8)	was	calculated	 by	inter	rated	reliability	
method.	The	consent	was	taken	from	the	subjects	for	
participation in study. Data collection was carried out from	14/02/2018	 to	15/03/2108.	 Sample	size	was	50	
post stroke patients who receive stroke rehabilitation 
at	Neurorehabilitation	 centres.	The	25	subjects	were	
randomly divided into two groups, experimental group 
and control group. The experimental group has received 
mirror therapy with the conventional therapy for 3 days 
in a week for 4 weeks. Other side the control group has 
received only conventional therapy for 4 weeks, and 
3	days	in	a	week.	The	effectiveness	 was	evaluated	by	
Modified	Brunnstrom’s	 motor	function	test	before	and	
after intervention. Data was compiled and analysis was 
done by using inferential and descriptive statistics.
RESULTS
Fig. 1: Effectiveness of mirror therapy in stroke 
patients on the functioning of hand
In pre-test, all the experimental and control group stroke 
patients	had	poor	functioning	 of	hand.	In	post-test,	48%	of	
the experimental group samples had poor functioning of 
hand and 52% of them had average functioning of hand. 
In	control	group,	68%	of	the	samples	had	poor	functioning 	
of hand and 32% of them had average functioning of hand. 
This shows that the mirror therapy remarkably improved 
the hand functioning of stroke patients.

DISCUSSION
The literature includes some studies that support 
the use of Mirror Therapy in post-stroke rehabilitation. 
However, researches involving MT have evolved over 
the past years, acquiring better methodological quality.
The studies found in this review assessed individuals 
in	the	post-stroke	 and	showed	similar	effects	concerning	
the	effectiveness	 of	MT	on	recovery	of	the	motor	
function.
The	above	findings	of	the	study	are	supported	 by	
a study conducted by, Pournima Pawar, vijaykumar 
biradar to	evaluate	the	effectiveness	 of	the	constraint	
induced movement therapy (CIMT) and combined 
mirror	therapy	for	patient’s	rehabilitation	 of	the	patients	
with subacute and chronic stroke patients.Twenty 
patients were enrolled and divided into two groups 
CIMT group, CIMT with Mirror therapy group. CIMT 
group 6 hours a day for 4 days per week for 4 weeks 
,and CIMT with Mirror therapy group 30 minutes of 
mirror with CIMT for 4 days per week for 4 weeks . 
The fugl-meyer motor function assessment (FMS) and 
Brunnstrom V oluntary control grading were evaluated 
4weeks after the treatment. The score of the Brunnstrom 
V oluntary control grading p value (P value 0.0001) 
and Fugl-meyer scale P value (0.0001), mirror therapy 
combined with CIMT showed more improvement than 
the CIMT after 4 weeks of treatment.6
Kil-Byung Lim, Hong-Jae Lee, Jeehyun Yoo, 
Hyun-Ju Yun, Hye-Jung Hwang conducted study on 
efficacy	of	mirror	therapy	containing	 tasks	in	post	stroke	
patients	to	investigate	 the	effect	of	mirror	therapy	on	
upper extremity function and activities of daily living. 
The samples were randomly divided into two groups 
that were mirror therapy group and sham therapy 
group, each group contains 30 samples. The mirror therapy group has undergone a mirror therapy with 
conventional therapy for 20 minutes per day on 5 days 
per 4 weeks. The Fugl Meyer assessment, Brunnstrom 
motor	recovery	stage	and	modified	barthel	index	were	
evaluated 4 weeks after the treatment. After 4 weeks of 
intervention,	 improvements	 in	the	FMA	(p=0.027)	 and	
MBI	(p=0.041)	 were	significantly	 greater	in	the	mirror	
therapy group than the sham therapy group. The mirror 
therapy	containing	 functional	 task	was	effective	in	terms	
of improving the upper extremity functions.7
CONCLUSION
The	findings	of	the	study	show	that	there	is	significant	
difference	 between	the	scores	of	experimental	 and	
control	group.	The	finding	shows	that	the	mirror	therapy	
brought	a	significantly	 effect	in	pre-test	and	post-test	on	
upper extremity functioning.

ABSTRACT
Background: 	Water	has	been	highly	considered	 for	rehabilitation	 because	it	facilitates	the	application	 of	
established	 therapeutic	 interventions	 including	stretching,	 strengthening,	 joint	mobilization,	 balance,	gait	
training and endurance training that helps in reducing back pain due to unique physical characteristics and 
low risks.
Objective: To	compare	the	effect	of	Hydrotherapy	 based	exercises	and	conventional	 physiotherapy	 in	
chronic	nonspecific	low	back	pain.
Materials and Method: An	experimental	 study	was	conducted	 at	physiotherapy	 Department	 of	Krishna	
Institute of Medical Sciences. A total 30 patients were equally divided into two groups using convenient 
sampling	with	random	allocation	(Group	A	and	Group	B).		Group	A	was	given	Conventional	 Therapy	and	
Group	B	was	given	Hydrotherapy.
Results: Statistical analysis was performed using paired t-test and unpaired t-test. Intra group comparison 
(within group) was analysed statistically using paired t-test for V AS, ROM, MMT and MODI. This shows that 
there	is	an	extremely	 significant	 difference	 of	Group	A	similarly	there	is	an	extremely	 significant	 difference	
of	Group	B.	But	in	intergroup	 comparison	 (between	group)	was	analysed	statistically	 using	unpaired	t-test.	
This	shows	that	pre-intervention	 there	was	no	statistically	 significant	 difference	 seen	with	P	values	of	VAS,	
ROM,	MMT	and	MODI.	While	on	comparing	 post	interventional	 values,	the	results	between	two	groups	
using	unpaired	t-test	revealed	that	there	was	statistically	 significant	 difference	seen	with	P	values	of	VAS	was	
(P-	0.0182)	but	there	was	no	statistically	significant	difference	seen	with	P 	values	of	ROM,	MMT,	MODI.
Conclusion: From	the	study,	it	is	concluded	 that	there	was	significant	 improvement	 in	subjects	who	
underwent conventional therapy and hydrotherapy.

Just like reinforced steel can bear more weight than 
sheet of aluminum, a strong, well-conditioned back can 
stand with more stress, and protect spine better, than a 
back that has not been conditioned through exercise. 
Conditioning	 through	flexibility	and	strengthening	 back	
exercises	not	only	helps	to	avoid	the	back	injury,	or	
minimize	the	severity	of	injury.	It	can	also	help	to	relieve	
the pain from many back conditions1.
The human body has a centre of gravity, which keeps 
the balance between muscles and bones to maintain 
integrity	of	structures	and	protect	them	against	injury2. 
In	nonspecific	 low	back	pain,	imbalance	 typically	occurs	DOI Number: 10.5958/0973-5674.2019.00027.3 
     134      Indian Journal of Physiotherapy and Occupational Therapy, January-March 2019, Vol.13, No. 1
between	the	functional	 load,	which	is	effort	required	for	
work and in daily living activites3.	Low	back	pain	has	a	
lifetime	prevalence	 of	60-85%	but	it	is	seen	in	adult	is	
15%3 and it may vary according to age, gender, education 
and occupation4.
Chronic	nonspecific	 low	back	pain	is	the	pain	
where	the	patient	cannot	find	any	specific	cause	for	
more than 12 weeks such as infection, arthritis, fracture, 
spondylolisthesis etc5.	Generally	chronic	nonspecific	 low	
back pain is seen because of heavy physical exertion such 
as weight lifting, repetitive movement and frequent static 
posture.	Characteristic	 of	chronic	nonspecific	 low	back	
pain are heavy pain, worsening with exertion and relieved 
with rest. In some cases the cause may be sprain or an 
overstretch of a ligament or muscles6. The endurance of 
trunk muscles is low in patients with low back pain as 
compared to individual without low back pain. The deep 
trunk	muscles	(Transverse	 Abdominis	 and	Multifidus) 	
responsible for maintaining the stability of spine. It is 
studied that the poor endurance of trunk muscles may 
caused strain on structures and hence causes low back 
pain7.  In other cases the cause may be a minor problem 
with the disc between two vertebrae or a minor problem 
with	a	small	facet	joint	between	two	vertebrae.	There	may	
be other minor problems in the structures and tissues of 
the lower back that result in pain.
Stretching and strengthening exercises is one of 
the	useful	mode	of	exercise	for	chronic	nonspecific	 low	
back pain to decrease the pain while working out. If 
these exercises are done in water, the properties of water 
relieves	pain,	reduces	muscle	spasm,	increases	joint	range	
of motion, strengthen weak muscles, improve circulation, 
provide resistance and improves balance and coordination8. 
Moreover, the combinations of the buoyancy, resistance 
properties	 of	water	allow	easier	joint	movement	 and	
diminish disabilities than on land9. Although it appears 
that water-based exercises may be suitable exercises for 
individuals to improve quality of life.
Hydro means water so we can called Hydrotherapy, 
Aquatic	therapy	or	Pool	therapy.	The	heat	and	flotability	
of the water can block nociceptors by acting on thermal 
receptors and mechanoreceptors and exert a positive 
effect	on	spinal	segments10.	Water	has	many	properties	
that give it the ability to heal.
 zWater	can	store	and	carry	heat	and	energy.
 zWater	cannot	hurt	you,	even	if	you	are	sensitive	to	
your surroundings. zWater	can	help	blood	flow.
 zWater	has	a	soothing,	calming,	and	relaxing	effect	
on people.
 zExercise	in	water	takes	the	weight	off	a	painful	
joint	while	also	providing	resistance11.
Hydrotherapy is one of the method that recently has 
found great popularity in rehabilitation12.
Benefits	of	hydrotherapy	 are	due	to	properties	 of	
water such as:
 1. Buoyancy:  Buoyancy reduces force of gravity and 
provides resistance which is used to strengthen 
the muscles.
 2. Hydrostatic pressure:  Hydrostatic pressure is 
the	pressure	exerted	by	water	on	immersed	object.	
That pressure and depth allows the patients to 
perform exercise more easily.
 3. Viscosity:  Viscosity creates resistance to all active 
exercises.
 4. Surface tension:  In surface tension the use of 
equipment at surface increase the resistance13.
Now a days, physiotherapy is growing with 
multispecialty like hydrotherapy which is used to 
treat disorders14.	In	chronic	nonspecific	 low	back	pain	
there	is	no	specific	problem	or	disorder	that	can	be	
identified	as	the	cause	of	pain	but	water	will	relieve	
discomfort and promote physical well-being15.  The 
use of Pharmacotherapy example Non-steroidal anti-
inflammatory	 drugs	and	Skeletal	muscle	relaxant	tend	
to	have	various	side	effects	with	their	prolonged	 use.	
Patient with only drug therapy have high chance of 
recurrences and worsening of spinal function leading to 
early degenerative changes in spinal structures. On the 
other hand hydrotherapy gives an opportunity of natural 
way	of	therapy	by	which	this	chronic	non	specific	low	
back	pain	can	be	effectively	managed.
Aim:	To	find	out	the	effectiveness	 of	hydrotherapy	 based	
exercises	for	chronic	nonspecific	low	back	pain.

MATERIALS AND METHOD
It was an experimental study conducted in the 
KIMSDU.	 30	participants	 were	equally	divided	into	
two groups using convenient sampling with random 
allocation.	 Group	A	was	given	conventional	 therapy	
and	Group	B	was	given	hydrotherapy.	 The	patient	were	
selected according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. 
Written	informed	consent	was	taken	and	whole	study	was	
explained to them. Detailed musculoskeletal evaluation 
was	done	to	screen	the	subjects.	Inclusion	criteria	were	
as	follow:	1.	Subjects	clinically	diagnosed	 as	chronic	
nonspecific	 low	back	pain,	2.	Both	genders,	3.	Age	group	
–	20yrs	to	45yrs,	4.	Participants	 willing	to	participate	 in	
study, 5. Swimmers. Exclusion criteria were as follows: 
1.	Individuals	 with	specific	causes	for	back	pain,	2.	
Subject	with	systemic	illness:	-Neurological	 disorders	
like ataxia, Respiratory disorders, Cardiac disorders.  3. 
Individuals with hydrophobia.
Group A:  Treatment given was as follows:
 1. Hot moist pack for 15 min.
 2. Static back exercises
 3. Stretching
 4. Core strengthening exercises for back
 5. Ergonomic advice for posture
Group B:  All therapeutic exercises performed in water 
were given according to problem solving approaches 
like:
 1. Stretching exercises for hip and lower back
	 	In	Standing	position:	Knee	to	chest	exercises,	Leg	
raise
  In Prone position:-Superman position exercises

DISCUSSION
The	purpose	of	present	study	was	to	find	out	the	
effectiveness	 of	hydrotherapy	 based	exercises	 for	
chronic	nonspecific	low	back	pain.
Low	back	pain	is	considered	 as	3rd highest problem 
faced by the population worldwide. Since there is 
change in the lifestyle due to competing professions 
people	tend	to	ignore	their	spine	health.	Lack	of	self-
care and awareness of the exercises has given a rise to 
this population. Thus intervention in an order to relieve 
the pain, improve range of motion was made as well as 
strengthening of the muscles and improved quality of the 
life are also done with exercise.
Reviewing various studies, it was analyzed that 
many exercise protocols like aerobic exercise, lumbar 
stability exercise, swiss ball exercise, only core 
strengthening exercises were line of treatment routinely 
used	for	chronic	nonspecific	low	back	pain.
This study was undertaken considering all the 
mentioned points, and the aim of this study was to 
find	out	effect	of	hydrotherapy	 in	chronic	nonspecific	
low back pain. Based on the principal of hydrotherapy, 
Exercise	in	water	takes	the	weight	off	a	painful	joint	
while also providing resistance.
Benefits	of	conventional	 therapy:-It	 helps	to	control	
functional activities and in dynamic stabilization of 
joints,	It	moreover	 improves	 the	endurance	 of	the	
muscle, It activates muscle to begin to re-establish 
neuromuscular control.
Benefits	of	Hydrotherapy:-Exercise	 in	water	takes	the	
weight	off	a	painful	joint	while	also	providing	resistance,	
Improved	muscle	strength,	Greater	flexibility	and	range	of	
motion of the spine, Enhanced balance and coordination of muscle groups to stabilize the spine and reduces stress 
on the back pain, Increased tendency to maintain a neutral 
spine	position	during	exercises,	Efficiency	 of	water	will	
provide	great	advantage	for	subjects	to	improve	quality	of	
life and diminishes disabilities17. 
Many authors conducted studies on hydrotherapy for 
low back pain. So according to Dundar U, Solak O, Yigit  
determined	 the	effect	of	aquatic	exercise	to	treat	chronic	
low back pain and came to a conclusion that water based 
exercises produce better improvement in disability and 
quality of life of the patients with chronic low back 
pain	than	land	based	exercises.	 Then	Sjogren	T,	Long	
N, Storay I, Smith J, studied group hydrotherapy versus 
group land based treatment for chronic low back pain 
and come to conclusion that the both groups improved 
significantly	 in	functional	 ability	and	in	decreasing	
pain levels. Then Smit TE and Harrison R studied 
Hydrotherapy and chronic lower back pain: A pilot 
study.	and	come	to	conclusion	 that	the	beneficial	effects	
from hydrotherapy may not be long lasting, suggesting 
the need for continuing sessions to maintain improved 
mobility and reduced pain levels. Then Cuesta-Vargas 
Al,	Garcia-Roero	 JC	studied	exercise,	manual	therapy,	
and education with or without high-intensity deep 
water	running	for	nonspecific	 chronic	low	back	pain:	
a pragmatic randomized controlled trial and come to 
conclusion that the pain, disability, health status, muscle 
strength and endurance, and lumbar range of motion 
significantly	 improved	in	both	groups.	The	addition	of	
deep water running program at an individual workload 
of the aerobic threshold to the multimodal physical 
therapy	program	produced	a	significant	 improvement	 in	
pain	in	patients	with	nonspecific	 chronic	low	back	pain,	
but	this	was	not	significantly	 different	when	compared	
with multimodal physical therapy program alone. 
Disability, health status, muscle strength and endurance, 
and	lumbar	range	of	motion	significantly	 improved	to	
a similar level in both interventional groups. Thermo 
therapy should always be used prior mobilization and 
MET is a form of mobilization. Hot moist packs relieve 
pain, relaxes muscles by vasodilation.18
Our study states that age groups with 20-40 are more 
affected	as	compared	to	41-50	due	to	changing	lifestyle.	
Intragroup comparison (within group) was analysed 
statistically using paired t-test for V AS, ROM, MMT 
and MODI scores, and intergroup comparison (between 
group) was analysed statistically using unpaired t-test.

Intra group comparison (within group) was analysed 
statistically using paired t-test for V AS, ROM, MMT and 
MODI.	This	shows	that	there	is	an	extremely	 significant	
difference	 of	Group	A	similarly	there	is	an	extremely	
significant	 difference	 of	Group	B.	But	in	intergroup	
comparison (between group) was analysed statistically 
using unpaired t-test. This shows that pre-intervention 
there	was	no	statistically	 significant	 difference	 seen	
with	P	values	of	VAS,	ROM,	MMT	and	MODI.	While	
on comparing post interventional values, the results 
between two groups using unpaired t-test revealed 
that	there	was	statistically	 significant	 difference	 seen	
with	P	values	of	VAS	was	(P-	0.0182)	but	there	was	no	
statistically	 significant	 difference	 seen	with	P	values	of	
ROM, MMT, MODI.  
Clinical significance: Our study shows that 
conventional therapy and hydrotherapy are both 
effective	maneuvers	 in	chronic	nonspecific	 low	back	
pain.	Recurrence	 is	observed	in	subjects	who	underwent	
conventional therapy after some months. However, 
subjects	who	underwent	 hydrotherapy	 recovered	 faster	
as	compared	 to	conventional	 therapy	subjects.	Thus,	
there	was	significant	 improvement	 in	subjects	who	
underwent conventional therapy and hydrotherapy.
CONCLUSION
Present study concluded that both conventional 
therapy	and	hydrotherapy	 group	showed	significant	
relief of pain, hydrotherapy being faster in relieving 
pain.	It	showed	extremely	 significant	 improvement	 in	
relieving pain, reducing functional disability statistically 
and clinically and thus facilitated the outcomes.

ABSTRACT
Background:  The incidence of stroke has rapidly increased in the past decade and is expected to increase in 
the coming decade. The rehabilitation of stroke is laboriously elaborate and burdensome for the individual 
and the community, leaving residual problems. The best option for managing stroke will be prevention by 
early	identification	 and	prediction	 of	those	at	high	risk.	Women	in	post-menopausal	 period	have	more	risk	
of stroke and more disability as compared to men. Thus, screening of post- menopausal women is needed.
Objective:  This study was intended to predict the risk of stroke in post-menopausal women.
Method:  This study is a cross-sectional study where 65 women were recruited after screening for inclusion 
and	exclusion	criteria.	The	study	participants	 were	tested	for	Hs-CRP	and	an	online	software	of	Qstroke.	
Values were noted and results were analysed.
Measurement Tools: 	Biochemical	Marker	(High-sensitivity	CRP),	Qstroke	 Algorithm
Results:	There	was	positive	correlation	 between	BMI	and	Hs-CRP	levels	(p=0.0001),	 and	also	between	age	
and	Qstroke	scores	(p=0.0001).	No	correlation	was	observed	in	Hs-CRP 	and	Qstroke	scores	(p=0.5987)
Conclusion:  Post-menopausal women might have an increased risk of developing stroke and the risk can be 
predicted	well	before	the	appearance	of	stroke	by	using	Hs-CRP 	and	Qstroke.
Keywords:  menopause, stroke, Hs-CRP , Qstroke
INTRODUCTION
The	World	Health	Organisation	 defines	stroke	as,	
“rapidly developing clinical signs of focal (or global) 
disturbance of cerebral function, lasting more than 24 
hours or leading to death, with no apparent cause other 
than that of vascular origin.”1 About 16.9 million people 
suffer	from	stroke	every	year.2 The prevalence of stroke 
in India was estimated to be 203 per 100,000 population 
above 20 years of age.3 It has been predicted that this 
incidence will keep rising in the upcoming years.4 The 
incidence	 and	prevalence	 of	stroke	differ	with	age,	
gender and ethnic origin.
Even	though	the	age	specific	incidence	of	stroke	is	
higher	in	men	than	in	women,	stroke	affects	a	greater	
number of female population and longer life expectancy 
and the fact that stroke rates increase in older age groups.5 
However, National Health and Nutrition Examination 
Survey(NHANES) has shown a higher prevalence of 
stroke	in	women	in	midlife	as	compared	to	men.	Women	between 45 to 54 years of age had higher odds of stroke 
versus male counterparts of the same age.6 Also, post 
stroke women were found to be more disabled in their 
daily activities than men.7 The rehabilitation of stroke is 
laboriously elaborate and burdensome for the individual 
and the community, leaving residual problems. The best 
option for managing stroke would be prevention by early 
identification	and	prediction	of	those	at	high	risk.
Menopause	 is	defined	as	amenorrhea	 or	absence	of	
menses for 12 consecutive months.  Studies have shown 
that premenopausal women are protected from stroke 
than male counterparts of the same age because of which 
exposure to endogenous estrogen is hypothesized to be a 
protector of stroke in women.8
	High	sensitive	CRP	(Hs-CRP)	 is	an	inflammatory	
bio-chemical marker and is used as an independent risk 
factor for occurrence of future stroke event.9 QStroke	is	
a newly developed and validated algorithm to predict 
the risk of stroke. It also provides accurate measures DOI Number: 10.5958/0973-5674.2019.00028.5 
     140      Indian Journal of Physiotherapy and Occupational Therapy, January-March 2019, Vol.13, No. 1
of absolute stroke risk in general population or healthy 
individuals who are free from stroke. 10 However, 
there is no literature for predicting stroke risk in post-
menopausal	women	using	Hs-CRP 	and	Qstroke.
Thus,	the	objective	of	this	study	was	to	predict	the	
risk of stroke in post-menopausal women by using Hs-
CRP	and	Qstroke.
METHOD
Participants:  After the study was approved by 
Institutional Ethical Committee, the participants were 
screened for their inclusion and exclusion criteria. This 
cross-sectional study was conducted on apparently 
healthy post-menopausal women in Belagavi city. A house 
to house screening of 124 post-menopausal women was 
done of which 65 women who had achieved menopause 
through natural way were recruited in this study. 
Exclusion criteria of the study included hysterectomy 
females, or women on Hormone Replacement Therapy, 
women with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, 
previous	stroke	or	cardio	vascular	events,	inflammatory	
conditions like osteo-arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis or 
pelvic	inflammatory	 disease.	These	conditions	 were	
excluded because these females may already have 
higher levels of Hs-CRP and may bias the results. After 
the recruitment, biochemical marker serum Hs-CRP 
was	assessed	through	a	blood	test	and	later	the	Qstroke	
algorithm was used to predict the percent risk of stroke 
in these women.
Measurement Tools:
Serum Hs-CRP: 	It	is	an	inflammatory	 biochemical 	
marker.	Level	of	Hs-CRP	predicts	the	risk	of	stroke	event. zLow	risk:	less	than	1.0	mg/L
 zAverage	risk:	1.0	to	3.0	mg/L
 zHigh	risk:	above	3.0	mg/L
Q stroke:	Q	Stroke	is	software	algorithm	to	predict	the	
risk of stroke. It predicts the percent risk of developing 
stroke in next 10 years.
DATA ANALYSIS
Karl	Pearson	correlation	 coefficient	 method	was	
used to assess correlation between age and BMI with 
Hs-CRP,	and	Qstroke	scores.	Statistical	significance	 was	
defined	at	5%	level	and	analyses	were	carried	out	using	
IBM SPSS software, version 19.
RESULTS
Mean values of all the data parameters was 
calculated.

Mean age of the women undertaken for the study 
was found to be 52.5. The calculated mean value for the 
BMI scores was 26.02. The mean values of the outcome 
measures were also calculated. Mean value of Hs-CRP 
was	3.152	and	that	for	Qstroke	percent	risk	was	1.275.

increases adipose tissue. Adipose tissue secretes hs-CRP 
and thereby increases the level in blood.12
The	mean	Qstroke	percentage	 was	found	to	be	
1.275(S.D=0.72)	 which	is	considerably	 on	the	lower	
side.	Qstroke	algorithm	values	are	influenced	 by	history	
of Hypertension, Diabetes and previous history of stroke 
events as well. As the present study was carried out 
on healthy population without any other history or co-
morbid	conditions,	the	Qstroke	value	was	lower.	
Association of age with status of risk was studied 
which shows 71% of the women under 45 years of 
age	were	at	high	risk,	28%	were	at	moderate	risk	and	
0% were at low risk i.e. women who achieved early 
menopause were found to be at a higher risk. Early 
or premature menopause occurs due to early ovarian 
insufficiency.13 Due to the estrogen associated with 
menopause, women who attained early menopause will 
have reduced lifetime exposure to endogenous estrogen, 
thereby increasing their risk.14
A	previous	study	revealed	similar	findings	as	of	
present study concluding that premature menopause 
can be an independent risk factor of stroke.13 However, 
another	study	done	by	Bjarne	Jacobsen	et	al	found	no	
correlation between age of menopause and stroke.15
Also, it was seen that the high risk value reduced in 
46-50 and 51-55 age group whereas moderate and low 
risk values also changed. The reason for this might be 
the pattern of estrogen decline that it reduces rapidly for 
a year and then attains a plateau after 1 to 3 years.16 The 
risk again increased in more than 56 years age group 
which may have aging factors associated. 
56.92% of the total women undertaken in this 
study were found to be at high risk, 32.31% were at 
moderate risk and only 10.77% were at low risk. The 
probable reason would be sudden decline in the hormone 
estrogen levels in the post-menopausal period. Estrogen 
has	beneficial	 effects	over	cardiovascular	 system	like	
vasodilatation	 and	increased	cerebral	flow	which	thus	There was no correlation found between age and Hs-
CRP	scores	(p=0.7739).	 However,	 significant	 positive	
correlation was found between BMI and Hs-CRP scores 
(p=0.0001)
Also,	there	was	significant	 positive	correlation	
between	age	and	Qstroke	scores	(p=0.0001)	 however,	
no	significant	 correlation	 was	found	between	BMI	and	
Qstroke	scores	(p=0.8199)

DISCUSSION
The present cross-sectional study aimed to predict 
the risk of stroke in post-menopausal women wherein 
Hs-CRP	and	Qstroke	outcome	scales	were	used	as	stroke	
risk predictors.
The mean age of post-menopausal women 
undertaken	 for	this	study	was	found	to	be	52.5	(S.D=	
5.365) as the menopausal age usually ranges between 40 
to 60 years.8
The	mean	BMI	was	26.02(S.D=	 3.315)	which	
indicates overweight and obesity. The probable reason 
for this is the increased fatness and increased levels 
of physical inactivity seen in midlife and menopausal 
period.11 The mean Hs-CRP value was 3.512 
(S.D=2.087).	 Values	above	3.0	mg/L	are	considered	
to be high risk of stroke. Presence of other risk factors 
like cholesterol levels, triglyceride levels will have an 
influence	on	hs-CRP	value.	Also,	physical	inactivity

decreases cerebral vascular tone and increases arterial 
compliance. Thus estrogen provides a protective shield 
against stroke before menopause.6
Positive correlation was found between BMI scores 
and increased hs-CRP levels. The reason for this is the 
underlying pathology of obesity. Additional fat tissue 
in the body requires more oxygen and nutrients which 
therefore needs blood vessels to circulate more blood to 
the fat tissue. This increases heart workload as it has to 
pump more blood through additional blood vessels. Also, 
obesity or increased body weight may increase heart rate 
and	reduce	body’s	ability	to	transport	blood	through	the	
vessels.17 Also, fat cells secrete several substances that 
have	unfavourable	 effects	on	the	body	like	increased	
inflammation,	 hardening	 of	arteries	and	blood	clotting.18 
As	hs-CRP	is	an	inflammatory	 marker,	this	correlation	
was found to be positive. No correlation was found 
between age and hs-CRP levels. This might be due to 
exclusion	of	all	the	age	related	inflammatory	 conditions	
which might have shown higher hs-CRP levels.
Correlation	 between	Qstroke	scores	with	age	was	
found to be positive. Aging leads to structural and 
functional changes in the blood vessel walls, leading to 
increased	arterial	wall	stiffness	and	decreased	 vascular	
distensibility.19 This can cause increased heart work load 
and	reduced	cerebral	blood	flow.	Thus,	Qstroke	scores	
will increase with increase in age and so will the stroke 
risk.	No	correlation	 was	found	between	BMI	and	Qstroke	
scores. As BMI or obesity is associated with other risk 
factors like cholesterol and triglyceride levels, these 
factors are independent of age factor and can be present 
in any age group. This might be the probable reason of 
no correlation between the two variables.
Lastly,	there	was	no	correlation	 between	the	Hs-
CRP	and	Qstroke	scores.	The	reason	for	this	might	be	
that both the outcome measures predicts stroke risk 
taking	into	account	different	factors.
There was a study done by Dibyaratna Patgiri et al 
which used Hs-CRP as a novel marker for determining 
stroke risk which concluded that the rise in Hs-CRP 
levels	can	be	identified	well	before	the	stroke	event	to	be	
used as a predictor of stroke risk.9
A study done by Julia Hippisley-Cox et al for 
derivation	 and	validation	 of	Qstroke	algorithm	 shows	
that it is a valid measure of absolute stroke risk in the 
general population of patients free of stroke.10Therefore,	 both	Hs-CRP	and	Qstroke	can	be	used	
as stroke risk predictors in post-menopausal women as 
well because both are reliable and proved to be valid in 
previous studies.
Limitations: This cross-sectional study was conducted 
on a small sample size.
Scope: Similar studies with higher study population 
can	be	undertaken	 for	more	accurate	results.	Women	
predicted with high stroke risk can be explained about 
the	lifestyle	modifications	 that	need	to	be	done	in	order	to	
avoid the stroke event. Also, obese women can be given 
exercises or an aerobic training program for reduction 
in obesity and further reducing the chances of getting 
stroke.	Hs-CRP	levels	and	Qstroke	scores	can	be	used	
as follow up records to compare previous reports which 
will be useful for the study population as feedback.
CONCLUSION
Post-menopausal women may have increased risk 
of stroke and this risk can be predicted using serum Hs-
CRP	levels	or	by	using	Qstroke	algorithm.

INTRODUCTION
Neck pain is the most common public health 
problem	which	affects	both	personal	health	and	overall	
wellbeing of an individual1.	In	1933,	Ghormley	 coined	
the term facet syndrome to describe a constellation of 
symptoms associated with degenerative changes of the 
lumbar spine2.
55% of facet syndrome cases occur in cervical 
vertebrae, and 31% in lumbar. This includes all the 
structures	 that	are	a	part	of	the	facet	joint	such	as	the	
fibrous	capsule,	synovial	membrane,	 hyaline	cartilage	
and bone3.	The	prevalence	 of	cervical	facet	joint	pain	
may be as low as 26% or as high as 65%, depending on 
how aggressively it is sought4 .Neck pain due to cervical 
facet	joint	involvement	 is	known	as	cervical	facet	disease	
or Cervical Osteoarthritis or Cervical Facet Syndrome. It is a structural deterioration of one or more of vertebral 
facet	joints	in	cervical	segment,	usually	upper	cervical	
segment.  It is more common in elderly and often lead 
to chronic neck pain is left untreated. It can also occur 
due	to	traumatic	injuries	which	further	accelerates	 the	
degeneration process. It is also common with athletes 
involved in high impact repetitive motion in sports like 
baseball, football, golf, wrestling and gymnastics. The 
natural ageing process being the largest contributor for 
Facet syndrome.
With	age	the	layer	of	cartilage	covering	the	facet	
joint	in	the	cervical	vertebra	begins	to	deteriorate,	 facet	
joint	bones	begin	to	rub	against	each	other	causing	
inflammation.	 This	inflammation	 further	triggers	the	
development of osteophytes or bone spurs, that develop 
near	the	damaged	facet	joints;	in	an	attempt	to	stabilise	
a weakened spine. These osteophytes can compress or DOI Number: 10.5958/0973-5674.2019.00029.7 
Indian Journal of Physiotherapy and Occupational Therapy, January-March 2019, Vol.13, No. 1          145      
irritate	the	nerve	roots	or	spinal	cord	near	the	facet	joints.	
This compression would produce further symptoms like 
pain, tingling, numbness and muscle weakness.
Facet	joint	osteoarthritis	 (FJOA)	is	intimately	
linked to the distinct but functionally related condition 
of	degenerative	 disc	disease,	which	affects	structures	
in the anterior aspect of the vertebral column. FJOA 
and degenerative disc disease are both thought to be 
common causes of back and neck pain, which in turn 
have an enormous impact on the health-care systems 
and economies5.	Facet	joints	have	been	shown	capable	
of causing pain in the neck, upper and mid back, and low 
back with pain referred to the head or upper extremity, 
chest wall, and lower extremity in normal volunteers6,7,8.
Most often patient complaints of pain on cervical 
extension or rotation.
The most common symptoms are- Neck and shoulder 
Pain,	tenderness	 in	the	neck	region,	headaches,	 difficulty	
in bending, twisting or bearing heavy loads, decreased 
flexibility	 &	range	of	motion	of	neck,	sensation	 of	
creaking	and	popping,	stiffness	,	particularly	 more	in	
the morning ,muscle fatigue in neck, shoulder and arm, 
ringing in the ears.
We	undertook	 a	single	case	study	of	neck	pain	&	
stiffness	and	managed	him	with	physiotherapy	 measures	
like	stretching	&	strengthening	exercises	for	the	neck	pain.
METHOD
Participant: 	The	subject	was	a	65	years	old	man	whose	
chief	complaint	was	neck	pain,	decreased	 neck	flexion	
and overall decrease in neck ROM. He also complained 
of neck pain on neck extension. He is a surgeon by 
profession, usually spends lot of time in using the 
computer for academic purposes and had developed 
a forward head posture. He is myopic and has started 
developing cataract.
He complained of neck pain since past 6 months 
before he come to us for treatment. His pain further 
aggravated on computer use for more than 30 minutes. 
He was unable to touch his chest with his chin. On neck 
extension	he	felt	pain	on	facet	joints.
Before starting the treatment we advised him to 
get	a	plain	radiograph	 before	starting	the	treatment.	 We	
saw	that	the	lower	cervical	vertebrae	(C5,C6	&	C7)	are	fused	posteriorly	 at	the	facet	joints	and	there	is	literally	
no movement happening at the lower cervical region on 
assessment.
However there are osteophytes on the anterior 
margins of vertebral bodies and no complaints of neural 
involvement like impingement and impaired sensation 
on examination.

STUDY MEASURES
Neck Disability Index: 	The	NDI	is	a	modification	 of	
the	Oswestry	Low	Back	Pain	Disability	 Index.	It	is	a	
patient-completed,	 condition-specific	 functional	 status	
questionnaire with 10 items including pain, personal 
care, lifting, reading, headaches, concentration, work, 
driving,	sleeping	and	recreation.	 The	NDI	has	sufficient	
support and usefulness to retain its current status as the 
most commonly used self-report measure for neck pain9.
The NDI can be scored as a raw score10 or doubled and 
expressed as a percent 11. Each section is scored on a 0 to 
5	rating	scale,	in	which	zero	means	‘No	pain’	and	5	means	
‘Worst	imaginable	 pain’.	Al	the	points	can	be	summed	to	
a total score. The test can be interpreted as a raw score, 
with a maximum score of 50, or as a percentage.
0 points or 0% means: no activity limitations, 50 
points or 100% means complete activity limitation.
A higher score indicates more patient-rated 
disability. There is no statement in the original literature 
on how to handle missing data. To use the NDI for patient 
decisions, a clinically important change was calculated 
as	5	points,	with	a	sensitivity	 of	0.78	and	a	specificity	
of	0.8012.
     146      Indian Journal of Physiotherapy and Occupational Therapy, January-March 2019, Vol.13, No. 1
Mean	duration	of	the	test:	3	to	7.8	minutes9
Some benchmarks can be found in literature but 
methodologically they were not described and their 
validity and reliability are questionable Vernon and Moir 
presented the following interpretation:9
0-4points	(0-8%)	no	disability,
5-14points	(	10	–	28%)	mild	disability,
15-24points	(30-48%	)	moderate	disability,
25-34points (50- 64%) severe disability,
35-50points (70-100%) complete disability
PROCEDURE
The	subject	was	assessed,	the	base	line	scores		of	
Neck Disability index was noted. As pain was preventing 
from performing neck movements, he was advised for 
NSAIDS for 1 week. After which he was again assessed 
and his scores were recorded.
As the pain was under control, he was given 
Physiotherapy regimen, which was a combination 
therapy. The physiotherapy regimen included neck 
mobility exercises, self neck stretches and neck isometric 
strengthening exercises.
Neck	Mobility	exercises	include:	Cervical	flexion,	
extension,	 side	flexion	and	rotation	of	available	ROM	
are performed. Each exercise was performed 2 times a 
day for 10 repetitions.
Self-neck	 stretches	 –	which	include	cervical	
extensor stretching, stretching of trapezius, stretching 
of sternocleidomastoid muscle. Each of the exercise was 
performed 2 times a day for 5 repetitions.
Isometric strengthening exercise for neck- chins 
tucking in exercise (neck retraction exercises), isometric 
exercises	for	cervical	flexors,	extensors	and	side	flexors.	
The hold time for these isometric exercises were for 5 
seconds during each exercise. These exercises were 
performed 2 times a day for 10 repetitions.
He was taught the exercises in the physiotherapy 
department. And his Neck disability index was measured 
every week after post-physiotherapy treatment. The 
combination physiotherapy regimen was continued for 
5 weeks.DATA ANALYSIS
Results of each clinical evaluation are presented in 
time series design. Baseline measurements were taken 
at 0 week, after which NSAIDS were given for 1 week. 
The patient was assessed and after that combination 
physiotherapy was given for a total duration of 5 weeks. 
The NDI and NRS scores were noted after the end of 
each week.
Chart-1: NDI Score pre and post intervention
RESULTS
The results of the clinical evaluation are presented 
in	Chart	1.	Each	displays	significant	 improvements.	
As compared to the baseline measurement when the 
case was presented to us, after a week of analgesics 
medication the improvement was 10 %.
After the pain subsided on a combination 
physiotherapy treatment the neck disability index scores 
further	improved	significantly	 by	46%.	The	improvement	
following	physiotherapy	treatment	was	significant.
DISCUSSION
It was found that neck mobility and neck disability 
index	scores	were	significantly	 improved	 following	
combination physiotherapy after duration of 4 weeks. 
Neck	pain	is	a	most	crippling	condition	which	can	affect	
our	daily	lives.	Baseline	measurements	 were	68%.	
Physiotherapy treatment could not be given as the pain 
was severe enough in NRS. After NSAIDs the scores 
came	down	by	10%	and	was	58%.	Intervention	 was	
given after 1 week, as the pain subsided. At the end of 
each week of intervention the pain subsided gradually. 
Treatment continued for another 5 weeks post NSAIDS. 
After the end of 5 weeks of continuous physiotherapy 
treatment improvement was found to be by 46%.
Indian Journal of Physiotherapy and Occupational Therapy, January-March 2019, Vol.13, No. 1          147      
There	is	lot	of	literature	that	suggests	that	the	major	
protocols that can be used for neck pain should include 
low intensity training 13, neck mobility exercises which 
can be concentric exercise14 and isometric exercises15. 
It has also been found that a regular cervical stretching 
program for 4 weeks can decrease neck and shoulder pain 
and improving quality of life in normative population 
with chronic moderate to severe neck pain16.
A	study	by	Esther	Liyanage	et	al	also	showed	that	
Neck exercises and stretching along with ergonomic 
intervention	 proved	more	beneficial	 than	ergonomics	
alone for neck pain in computer Professionals with neck 
pain17.	At	the	end	of	the	session	the	subject’s	symptoms	
were	relieved	and	could	do	his	 ADLs	much	easily.
Study Limitation:  The study could have been followed 
up for a longer duration. Other scoring parameters can 
be considered. If possible the study can be conducted as 
an experimental study for a larger sample size.
CONCLUSIONS
It was found that with the help of analgesic as the pain 
subsided to a tolerable level, physiotherapy treatment 
was commenced. After undergoing the treatment for 4 
weeks	there	was	significant	 improvement	 in	the	neck	
disability index scores.
Ethical Clearance:  Informed consent from the patient 
was taken.

ABSTRACT
Background: Neck pain is a frequent and disabling complaint in general population. Roughly about two 
third of general population have neck pain at some point of their lives. Prevalence is high in the middle aged 
people. Clinically, patients with neck pain usually report aggravation of their symptoms with reading. This 
indicates possible compromise of the neuro musculoskeletal structures of the neck. 
Purpose: To	find	whether	neural	tissue	mobilization	 could	reduce	pain,	improve	functional	 activity	and	
improve ROM in patients with cervicobrachial pain.
Aim: To	study	the	effectiveness	 of	neural	tissue	mobilization	 in	reducing	pain,	improving	 functional	 activity	
and	improve	cervical	ROM	in	subjects	with	cervicobrachial	pain.	between	the	age	group	25-40years.

INTRODUCTION
Neck pain is a frequent and disabling complaint in 
general population 1. Roughly about two third of general 
population have neck pain at some point of their lives2. 
Prevalence is high in the middle aged people3.	With	an	
increasing sedentary population, the prevalence of neck 
pain will continue to rise4.
The anatomical and biomechanical nature of the 
cervical spine encourages mobility at the cost of stability 
and strength. This is the reason why cervical pain and 
dysfunction are more common, particularly because of 
poor spinal posture. Reading for extended periods with 
poor neck posture has been considered as a risk factor 
for neck pain. Clinically, patients with neck pain usually 
report aggravation of their symptoms with reading. 
This indicates possible compromise of the neuro 
musculoskeletal structures of the neck5-12.Neck pain may also radiate to the regions like 
shoulder, head or upper arm. Many patients also 
complaints	 of	stiff	neck	and	if	neck	pain	involves	any	
neural component patient will experience numbness, 
tingling	or	weakness	in	arm,	hand	and	fingers,	known	
as cervicobrachial pain syndrome often associated with 
neural dysfunction. Such dysfunction is caused by both 
the physiology and mechanics of the nerves leading to 
patients symptoms and limited range of motion of upper 
extremity and cervical ROM13.
Cervicobrachial pain is encountered commonly in the 
evaluation	 of	the	neck	pain	that	may	result	in	significant	
discomfort and functional limitations and disability. It is a 
condition caused by the compression of the nerve root in 
cervical spine that commonly manifests as neck pain and 
it may also radiate from the neck into the distribution of DOI Number: 10.5958/0973-5674.2019.00030.3

the	affected	nerve	root.	It	might	be	unilateral	or	bilateral.	
Patients with cervicobrachial pain often report neck pain; 
however, they most frequently seek treatment to address 
their arm pain. People with neck pain combined with 
upper extremity symptoms experience greater levels of 
disability	than	do	people	with	neck	pain	alone.When 	
the condition becomes chronic, it is likely to become 
persistent problem that impacts unfavourably on an 
individual’s	 physical	health14. The most recent study for 
the natural history of the cervicobrachial pain reported 
reoccurrence rate to be as high as 32%15. Despite of 
its large impact, there are no clear guidelines for the 
management of cervicobrachial pain.
Neural mobilization is a set of techniques designed 
to restore plasticity of the nervous system, it could be 
defined	as	the	ability	of	the	nerve	and	its	associated	
structures to shift in relation to each other structures16,17. 
The goal of neural mobilization is to increase the 
flexibility	 of	collagen	that	maintains	 the	integrity	of	
the nerve, thus improving movement or excursion 
of the nerve in relation to its interface18. Few studies 
with	specific	inclusion	 criteria	have	utilized	neural	
tissue mobilization and demonstrated better reductions 
in pain with improved functional outcomes19. This 
treatment approach focuses on passive mobilization 
of mechanically sensitized neural tissue structures 
with	a	primary	objective	 of	restoring	 appropriate	
neurodynamics19-24. Neural tissue mobilization improve 
neurophysiological and neuromechanical functions of 
the peripheral nervous system24-28. This technique is 
based on the sliding principle of neural tissue excursion 
which consists of an alteration of combined movements 
of	at	least	two	joints,	in	which	one	movement	 causes	
elongation of the nerve bed hence accelerating tension 
in the nerve, whereas the second movement reduces 
the length of the nerve bed that unloads the nerve, 
maintaining it in its relaxed position thus diminishing 
intra neural pressure. This technique aim to mobilize 
a nerve with a minimal increase in tension and are 
thought to result in a larger longitudinal excursion than 
techniques which simply elongate the nerve bed.29
Aim: To	study	the	effectiveness	 of	neural	tissue	
mobilization in reducing pain, improving functional 
activity	and	improve	cervical	ROM	in	subjects	with	
cervicobrachial pain between the age group 25-40years.

mobilization in reducing pain, improving functional activity	and	improve	cervical	ROM	in	subjects	with

PROCEDURE
Permission from The Head of Institution and 
approval from Institutional Ethical Committee was 
obtained.	Subjects	which	were	clinically	 diagnosed	
with chronic neck pain were screened according to the 
inclusion and exclusion criteria and informed consent 
was taken. Intervention was given for twice a week for 4 
weeks	(8	sessions)
Baseline measurement of NPRS, Neck Disability 
Index	(finding	the	level	of	disability	in	patients	with	
cervicobrachial pain) and Cervical ROM were assessed 
before intervention and at the end of the last day 
of intervention. The patients received neural tissue 
mobilization	 technique	were	instructed	to	lie	supine	(flat	
on	their	back).	The	‘sliding’	technique	uses	movements 	
that lengthens the median nerve bed (elbow and wrist 
extension	alone	or	combined	 with	neck	lateral	flexion	
or rotation away from the symptomatic arm). Shoulder 
abduction up to 90 degrees will preload the neural tissues 
during manual therapy techniques and nerve gliding 
exercises. Depression and abduction of shoulder, elbow 
extension,	forearm	supination,	 wrist	and	fingers	extension	
and	cervical	spine	contralateral	 side	flexion.		INTENSITY: 	
20-30 slow oscillation per session30.	FREQUENCY:	 twice	a week for four weeks. Along with it sensory TENS of 
frequency 4Hz and pulse duration 0.1s was given to the 
subjects	for	15mins	after	the	initial	treatment.

DISCUSSION
Neural Tissue Mobilization on NPRS: Selvaratnam 
,Matyas in their study said that- neural mobilization 
causes movement of adhered nerve and dura matter with restoration of normal mechanics of surrounding 
connective tissue accompanied with pain reduction31.
Cynthia	L	Brown,	Kerry	K	Gilbert	in	their	study	said	
that during neural mobilization various physiological 
changes takes place within the mechanical interface 
of nerve and changes the intraneural mechanics. The 
improvement	 is	may	be	due	to	blood	flow,	axonal	
     152      Indian Journal of Physiotherapy and Occupational Therapy, January-March 2019, Vol.13, No. 1
transport, or temperature and re-myelination of nerve 
may	also	take	place.	Also,	there	may	be	fluid	movement	
in the mechanical interface with gliding movement 
which reduces the probability of adhesions in the nerve, 
which may also reduce the pain32.
Virali R. Raval, Vinod Babu. In their study concluded 
that patients in group A i.e. who received neural tissue 
mobilization along with traction shows better results in 
improving NPRS and NDI compared to patients in group 
B	or	C,	the	effect	of	neural	mobilization	 may	be	because	
Neural tissue mobilization techniques focus on restoring 
the ability of the nervous system to tolerate the normal 
compressive, friction, and tensile forces associated with 
daily and sport activities, the clinical assumption is that 
these sliding techniques result in a larger longitudinal 
excursion of the nerve with a minimal increase in strain 
on impinged or tensed nerve. Nerve sliding elongates 
the nerve bed which elongates the nerve, increases 
the nerve tension and intraneural pressure reduces the 
intraneural	 blood	flow	in	the	oedematous	 neuropathies.	
Dynamically altering intraneural pressure may result in 
a	‘pumping	 action’	or	‘milking	effect’	with	beneficial	
effects	on	nerve	hydration	as	it	facilitates	 the	removal	
of the intra neural oedema when correctly applied and 
hence brings about a reduction in symptoms33.
Neural Tissue Mobilization on NDI: Nee RJ, Butler 
D. Neural mobilization gives positive impact on cervical 
neck disability by improving intraneural circulation, 
which	improves	axoplasmic	 flow,	hence	improving	 neural	
connective tissue viscoelasticity and reducing the sensitivity 
of	AIGS	(Abnormal	impulse	generating	sites)34.
Cato A Basson, Aimee Stewart, in their study 
said	that	neural	tissue	mobilization	 is	effective	in	
improving NDI the reason may be. NM is said to 
affect	the	axoplasmic	 flow,	movement	 of	the	nerve	
and its connective tissue improves the circulation of 
the nerve by alteration of the pressure in the nervous 
system and dispersion of intraneural oedema. NM can 
also decrease the excitability of dorsal horn cells. NM 
is	an	intervention	 that	is	aimed	at	affecting	the	neural	
structures or surrounding tissue (interface) directly or 
indirectly through neural mobilization. The interface can 
be mobilised by mobilising the tissue surrounding the 
nerve, along the course of the nerve35.
Kim	DG,	Chung	SH,	Jung	HB	In	their	study	
concluded	 that	there	was	significant	 difference	 between	
the pre intervention and post intervention in NPRS, NDI,	ROM	and	deep	flexor	endurance	 in	the	group	who	
received neural tissue mobilization36
Neural Tissue Mobilization on Cervical ROM: Kim	
DG,	Chung	SH,	Jung	HB	In	their	study	concluded	
that	there	was	significant	 difference	 between	the	pre	
intervention and post intervention in NPRS, NDI, ROM 
and	deep	flexor	endurance	 in	the	group	who	received	
neural tissue mobilization36.
Miriam	Marks,	T	Schottker	Koinger	in	their	study	
said that ROM is improved by neural tissue mobilization 
to a lesser extent, this may be explained by the improved 
gliding and sliding of neural tissue leading to reduced 
interference of cervical motion37. 
Jason M-  in their study said that - Neural 
mobilization	 had	an	immediate	 hypoalgesic	 effect	
on	C-fiber	mediate	pain	perception	 via	thermal	pain	
sensitivity testing. Furthermore, Neural mobilization 
techniques resulted in improvements in elbow extension 
ROM	and	decreased	 intensity	of	specific	sensory	
descriptors during neurodynamic testing.
CONCLUSION
Neural	tissue	mobilization	 is	effective	in	reducing	pain,	
improve	ability	and	cervical	ROM	in	subjects	between	the	
age group 25-40years with cervicobrachial pain.

ABSTRACT
Background:  Stroke is the second leading cause of death globally, and the human and economic consequences 
are	profound.	Although	evidence	indicates	that	gender	differences	 in	stroke	risk	factors	are	marginal,	the	
impact of stroke has been shown to be stronger in women.
Method:	In	this	cross-sectional	 study,	60	participants	 30	male	and	30	female	who	suffered	from	stroke	were	
included based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. If participants agreed to participate in the study then the 
written	informed	consent	was	obtained.	Demographic	data	and	research	question	specific	data	were	obtained.
Result:	30	Male	(Mean	Age	:	59.13,	Mean	Duration	:	8.98	month)	&	30	Female	(Mean	Age	:	61.43,	Mean	
Duration	:	7.48	month)	were	included	in	the	study.	There	is	significant	 relation	between	activity	limitations,	
participation	 restriction,	 community	 reintegration	 among	male	and	female.	There	is	no	significant	 difference	
in activity limitation, participation restriction, and community re-integration between male and female.
Conclusion: 	Study	findings	have	shown	that	positive	correlation	 between	activity	limitation,	 participation	
restriction,	 and	community	 reintegration	 is	there	in	both	male	and	female	participants.	 Gender	specific	
difference	 among	activity	limitation	 and	participation	 restriction	 and	community	 integration	 found	no

Traditional health indicators were morbidity and 
mortality	but	the	approval	of	the	International	 Classification 	
of	Functioning,	 Disability	and	Health	(ICF)	by	the	World	
Health Assembly has given new insight to measure health. 
Due to which health is now explained by bio psychosocial 
view considering personal and environmental factors. 
This model focuses on Body structure, function, Activity 
and	Participation.	 This	conceptual	 model	or	classification 	not only acknowledges the dysfunction or deviation of 
bodily function and structure in the form of impairments, 
but it also encapsulates the burden of activity limitations 
and participation restrictions experienced by the patients 
in his or her unique architectural-, social- and attitudinal 
environment.1
Stroke is the second leading cause of death globally, 
having profound human and economic consequences 
and	is	major	cause	of	disease	burden.	As	per	the	Global	
Burden of Disease Report, for high-income countries 
stroke is the third leading cause and for low to middle-
income countries stroke is t    he seventh leading cause 
of disease burden.2 Physical impairments, cognitive or 
emotional disturbances and communication disorders 
resulting	from	stroke	is	likely	to	result	in	affected	
interpersonal relations or social isolation.3
Although	evidence	indicates	that	gender	differences	
in stroke risk factors are marginal,4 the impact of stroke DOI Number: 10.5958/0973-5674.2019.00031.5

has been shown to be stronger in women. 5 It has also 
been noted that women tend to fare worse than men after 
stroke as more women are dependent on others for self-
care activities than men 6. The fact that stroke occurs 
later in life among women than men put them at a greater 
risk of functional disability and institutionalization.7
Activity	limitations	 are	defined	as	difficulties	 an	
individual may have in performance of activities. Social 
Participation	 is	defined	as	an	individual’s	 involvement 	
in life situations; social participation is increasingly 
being recognized as an important aspect of life. Social 
participation is a component of human functioning that 
reflects	the	complexity	 of	a	person’s	roles	beyond	the	
performance of activities of daily life.8	Community 
reintegration	 is	defined	as	the	opportunity	 an	individual	has	
to live in the community with the already present condition 
(after a state of ill-health like stroke) and be valued for his/
her uniqueness and abilities, like everyone else.9
Stroke risk factors in male and female does not vary 
a	lot	but	the	fact	that	women	are	likely	to	be	affected	by	
stroke at later age causes more functional dependency 
in	them.	Gender	based	work	allocation	in	Indian	society	
assigns more of house hold work to be managed female 
which	is	likely	to	have	different	impact	of	stroke	in	male	
and female survivors. Considering the gender based 
variations in the roles responsibilities stroke may have 
different	impact	in	social	participation	 and	reintegration.
METHOD
This is the Cross sectional study included 60 stroke 
patients (30 male and 30 female) selected with convenient 
sampling based on eligibility criteria. Participant 
diagnosed	 with	first	ever	stroke,	medically	 stable	and	
discharged from Hospital (Discharge duration minimum 
6 weeks) were included in the study. Participants having 
cognitive impairment (Hindi MMSE score < 24) were 
excluded from the study. These participants were 
explained about the study and if they agreed to participate 
written informed consent was obtained. Demographic 
data were collected like age, name, gender, occupation, 
duration, contact number. Data Collection was done 
by asking information and scoring done for Barthel 
index,	London	handicap	scale,	functional	 ambulation,	
community reintegration questionnaire. This evaluation 
took around 25 to 30 min with each participant.
Activity limitation in the study is measured on 
Barthel index which is used to measure activities of 
daily living and is having good reliability, validity and 
adequate responsiveness to assess activity of daily 
living among stroke patients 10 and is found appropriate outcome measure for stroke trials and practice.11 It 
consists of 10 items feeding, bathing, grooming, bowel, 
bladder, transfer, mobility, toilet use, stairs .Total score 
is 100.The patient were graded according to the level 
of activity limitation. 0 indicates unable to perform the 
activity independently while10 indicates able to perform 
the activity independently.
Participation restriction in the study is measured 
on	London	Handicap	 Scale,	which	consists	of	6	
parameters mobility, physical activities, occupation, 
social	integration,	 orientation,	 economic	self-sufficiency	
.The	findings	were	graded	according	to	the	disadvantage	
as no, mild, minimal, moderate, severe, very severe 
.The sum of all the 6 parameters plus 0.456 gives the 
final	value.	Minimum	 scale	value	is	0	which	indicates	
total disability and Maximum scale value is 1.00 which 
indicates normal function. 12
Community	 Integration	 Questionnaire	 is	used	
to	find	community	 re	integration	 in	the	study.	This	
questionnaire consists of 3 component home integration, 
social integration, and integration of productive activities 
.The total score is obtained by summation of all the 
three	components.	 The	highest	CIQ	score	for	working	
participant	 is	29.The	highest	CIQ	score	for	retired	
participant	 is	28.	In	this	questionnaire,	 Total	Home	
Integration score is 10; Social Integration score is12; 
Integration into Productive Activities score for working 
participant is 7 and for retired participant it is 6.13
RESULTS
Spearman	 Rank	Order	correlation	 was	used	to	find	
association between activity limitation, participation 
restriction and community integration among male and 
female stroke patients. Mann whitney test was used to 
compare activity limitation, participation restriction and 
community integration among male and female stroke 
patients.
The study included 60 stroke patients matching the 
eligibility criteria. 30 Male (Mean Age of 59.13, Mean 
Stroke	Duration	of	8.98	month)	and	30	Female	(Mean	
Age	of	61.43,	Mean	Stroke	Duration	of	7.48	month)	
were included in the study. Demographic details of the 
study participants are shown in below mentioned Table 1

there	is	no	significance	 difference	 Activity	limitation,	
Participation restriction, Community Integration was 
found between male and female stroke patients
DISCUSSION
Data Analysis in the study has found positive 
correlation between activity limitation, participation 
restriction, and community reintegration in both male 
and female participants. This means that less activity 
limitation shows less participation restriction and 
better	community	 reintegration.	 These	findings	are	
line	with	finding	of	study	done	by	Hamzat	et	al	which	
shown	a	significant	 correlation	 was	observed	between	
functional ability and each community reintegration 
and participation restriction in female stroke survivors 
of Ibadan.14 In our study strong correlation between 
participation restriction and community integration 
has been found in female stroke patients but in male 
patient moderate correlation between participation 
restriction and community integration has been found. 
Activity limitation has shown moderate correlation with 
participation restriction and community integration in 
both male and female stroke survivors which is indicating 
participation restriction and community integration is 
likely	to	be	affected	by	not	only	activity	limitation	but	
other factors may also be contributing to it. The other 
factors as found in the study done by Jenita PC et al15 
may be age, self-esteem, depression etc. 
     158      Indian Journal of Physiotherapy and Occupational Therapy, January-March 2019, Vol.13, No. 1
While	seeing	the	gender	specific	difference	 among	
activity limitation and participation restriction and 
community	 integration	 found	no	significant	 difference	
between male and female which is not displaying 
any	increased	 affection	among	female	participants	 as	
compared to male participants this does not support the 
study assumption that increased stroke-related activity 
limitation ,participation restriction and community 
integration is likely to be there in female stroke survivors 
as compared to male stroke survivors. This can be 
justified	by	variation	in	findings	reported	as	some	studies	
findings	are	suggesting	 that	after	stroke	women	have	less	
favorable outcome as compared to male16,17 while other 
studies	are	there	reporting	no	difference	 in	post	stroke	
outcome between male and female.18,19
CONCLUSION
Study	findings	have	shown	that	positive	correlation	
between activity limitation, participation restriction, 
and community reintegration is there in both male 
and female participants. This means that less activity 
limitation shows less participation restriction and 
better	community	 reintegration.	 Level	of	correlation	 in	
the study is mostly moderate which shows that social 
participation and community integration is likely to be 
influenced	by	factors	other	than	activity	limitation.
While	seeing	the	gender	specific	difference	 among	
activity limitation and participation restriction and 
community	 integration	 found	no	significant	 difference	
between male and female which is not displaying 
any	increased	 affection	among	female	participants	 as	
compared to male participants.

ABSTRACT
Pain	is	the	most	commonly	 used	word	when	it	comes	to	Health.	There	are	various	branches	in	the	field	
of medicine which uses invasive and non invasive techniques to help a patient to get rid of this pain. The 
common principles of these techniques when dealing with pain removal are suppression of pain conduction 
or remove the source of the pain. Among alternative medicines, “Mudras” is an age old technique from the 
time	of	Vedas	and	Puranas,	which	is	non	invasive.	This	technique	uses	the	finger	tips	of	both	the	hands	to	rid	
the	body	of	various	diseases	and	disorders.	It	is	easy	to	practice,	simple	yet	effective.	The	Field	of	dentistry	
is ever expanding to meet the needs of both the patients and the dentist in terms of newer technique and 
newer technologies. In spite of all the possible comforts, due to long hours of practice, the doctor/dentist 
may succumb to pain due to wrong posture or due to use of any position for long hours. In such cases doing 
yoga mudra not only relieves pain but also aids in overall well being of the person. This article gives an 
overview	of	various	mudras	which	can	be	done	by	any	person	with	or	without	any	ill	health	for	their	benefit.

Health is most important in this world.  Nothing 
can substitute it. Pain is a universal phenomenon 
experienced	 by	young	&	old	alike.	There	is	no	one	on	
this earth who has not experienced it. In this fast life, 
pain has become an integral part of our smart life. Pain 
may range from mild discomfort to being very severe. 
Sometimes the severity of pain is such that the quality 
of	life	is	compromised	 due	to	pain.	Invasive	&	non	
invasive techniques are available to deal with pain. 
Complementary	 &	alternative	 medicines	 refer	to	those	practices/ therapies that help patients to recover fast, but 
without	any	scientific	proof.1
Integrated medicines are those which are used along 
with conventional medicines. Some of them are light 
therapy, magnetic therapy, homeopathy, naturopathy, 
chiropractic, energy medicine, pranic healing yoga, 
aromatherapy, hypnotherapy, massage, osteopathy, 
reflexology,	 relaxation	 therapies,	 spiritual	healing	and	
tai chi and acupuncture.1
Ergonomics	 is	the	study	of	people`s	efficiency	
in	their	environment.	 Literatures	 have	shown	a	high	
prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders among dentists. 
The sedentary nature of work together with altered 
posture and lack of application of ergonomic principles 
can	result	in	the	imbalance	 of	specific	group	of	muscles.2 
Occupational health hazards due to dental practice 
among dental professionals are on a continuous rise 
resulting	in	a	significant	 negative	impact	on	the	overall	
quality of life. Dentists tend to assume stressful body DOI Number: 10.5958/0973-5674.2019.00032.7

positions due to work place restrictions, and to obtain 
better access and visibility to the operating site.2 
This leads to fatigue of the practitioner, which over a 
long period of time cause decline in the health of the 
practitioner.	 The	‘doctor’ 	becomes	the	‘patient’.
In Sanskrit mudras means “seal, mark or sign”, 
which is physical equivalent or representation of a 
mantra. Mudra can be perceived as a hand posture with 
a	specific	pattern	of	finger	configurations.	 Complex	
mudras can be constructed from simple mudras with 
modifications.3
A Mudra/Yoga mudra  is a symbolic or ritual 
gesture.	It	is	seen	in	Hinduism,	 Buddhism.	 While	some	
mudras involve the entire body, most are performed 
with	the	hands	and	fingers.1 It is used not only as a 
complementary medicine, but also in various dance 
forms	like	Bharatanatyam,	Kathakalli,	Mohiniayyam.1
Yoga Mudras is a non-invasive technique which 
is	beneficial	to	anyone	willing	to	practice	it.	The	main	
principle	behind	the	‘Yoga	Mudras’	is	that	the	body	is	
comprised	of	‘Panchabhoota’ 	namely,	Agni,	Vayu,	Akasha,	
Prithvi, Varuna/Jala. Any disturbance or imbalance in 
these will lead to ill health. 4 By manipulating these 5 
elements	(energies)	with	the	use	of	fingers,	we	can	bring	
back	the	balance.	This	technique	uses	the	tips	of	fingers	&	
can be done at anytime of the day.
Each	of	our	fingers	represents	 the	5	elements:	
Thumb	symbolizes	 fire/Agni,	fore	finger	symbolizes	 air/
vayu,	the	middle	finger	for	space/	akasha,	ring	finger	for	
earth/prithvi	 and	little	or	small	finger	symbolizes	 jala/
water 4,5,6
Some of the disorders are due to increase / decrease 
in any of the elements. Of these elements, Agni is the 
‘Adhipathi’.	 It	is	said	that	agni	influences	 the	other	
elements.	 By	placing	any	of	the	fingers	at	the	base	
of the thumb, that particular element decreases. To 
increase any element, the thumb is placed at the base of 
the	particular	finger.	At	the	end	of	the	day,	the	mudras	
should	be	concluded	 by	‘Prana	mudra’.	There	are	few	
mudras which need to be performed every day for at 
least 10 minutes to maintain vital health. Ideally both 
hands	must	be	used	for	mudras.	They	are	Gnana,	Prithvi,	
Apana, Prana, Shoonya vayu, Dhyana mudras. 4 If	the	right	half	of	the	body	is	in	pain,	use	the	fingers	
of the left hand and vice versa to do mudra.
METHOD OF PRACTICE
The	tips	of	the	fingers	should	touch	each	other	
lightly.	The	rest	of	the	fingers	should	be	comfortable,	 as	
straight as possible. Mudras can be done while standing, 
sleeping,	walking,	listening	to	music,	jogging,	reading	
paper, watching TV .  Each mudra should be practiced 
for at least 15 minutes. For chronic ailments, each mudra 
should be done for 50 minutes followed by 15 minutes 
of Prana mudra. If it is not possible to do the mudras at 
a stretch, you can split each mudras, 3 sessions of 15 
minutes each followed by 15 minutes of Prana mudra.
Prana mudra is formed by placing the tips of the 
thumb,	ring	finger	and	little	finger	together,	whereas	the	
other	fingers	get	extended.	This	type	of	mudra	increases	
the vitality and reduces nervousness and fatigue.5
The following are few mudras which can be practiced 
in our daily life to combat pain due to work related 
musculoskeletal disorders.3-10 Not only these mudras 
combat pain; they also help in general well being. There 
are various mudras practiced in dentistry (Fig 1).

CONCLUSION
Mudras can be used by people of all walks of 
life. It is the belief of the authors that mudras need 
to	be	experienced	 by	each	one	to	know	the	benefits.	
Mudras can be used for a variety of ailments. Only a 
few of the mudras have been given here. For exhaustive 
study of mudras, books are available in all languages. 
Internet search reveals numerous sites of alternative (or) 
complementary medicines. The authors have followed 
these	mudras	and	have	found	profound	benefits	with	
varying degrees. As with any alternative, complementary 
medicines, it all depends on ones faith and beliefs. 
Never stop other medicines when doing mudras. It 
is a complementary therapy. Sometimes alternative 
therapies	are	beneficial	 when	the	routine	therapy	does	
not	provide	sufficient	relief.	Only	when	the	source	of	
pain	and	discomfort	 is	identified	and	removed,	will	the	
person	be	really	benefitted	by	mudras.

ABSTRACT
Background: Diabetes is fast gaining the status of a potential epidemic in India with more than 62 million 
diabetic individuals currently diagnosed with the disease. Diabetic peripheral neuropathy is a common 
complication	of	diabetes	that	can	cause	significant	morbidity	and	mortality.
Aims and Objectives:  The aim of the study is to determine the prevalence of Diabetic Neuropathy in Urban 
population of Ahmednagar City.
Material and Method:  Study Design is a cross-sectional study in Ahmednagar City. Study Period is from 
October	2017	to	March	2018.	Convenient	 sampling	was	done.	The	patients	were	given	a	questionnaire	
which was to be self-administered followed by clinical examination done by the therapist.
Results:  The prevalence of diabetic neuropathy among diabetics was found to be 6.25% for pure neuropathy 
and	is	42.70%	for	patients	with	only	significant	 clinical	examination.	 Higher	prevalence	 was	found	in	
patients	with	hypertension,	hyperlipidemia,	chronic	diabetic	patients	as	well	as	obese	subjects.

Diabetes Mellitus commonly referred to as diabetes, 
is a group of metabolic disorders in which there are high 
blood sugar levels over a prolonged period. 
According	 to	WHO,	the	global	prevalence	 of	
diabetes	among	adults	over	18	years	of	age	has	risen	
from	4.7%	in	1980	to	8.5%	in	2014.	Also,	globally	an	
estimated 422 million adults are living with diabetes 
mellitus	according	to	the	latest	2016	data	from	the	World	
Health Organisation.1.
There are various complications of diabetes 
mellitus which involves microvascular complications 
like neuropathy, retinopathy, etc and macrovascular 
complications which involves Atherosclerosis One of the most chronic and debilitating complications of diabetes 
is “Diabetic Neuropathy.”2
According to a study in Tamil Nadu by Preeti 
Pawde, prevalence of neuropathy among Diabetics is 
33.33%. 63% of patients with higher duration of diabetes 
have neuropathy. This shows that higher the duration of 
Diabetes, higher the chances of the patient developing 
neuropathy3.
Diabetic Neuropathy is a nerve damaging disorder 
associated with Diabetes Mellitus. Neuropathic disorder 
in diabetes can impair functioning of the central, 
peripheral and/or autonomic nervous systems. Diabetic 
neuropathy	 affects	the	peripheral	 nerves,	which	causes	
the	loss	of	protective	 sensation	and	impairs	patient’s	
ability to perceive incipient or even apparent ulcerations 
in the feet. It is considered a main risk factor for 
amputation,	 and	hence	a	significant	 cause	of	morbidity	
in Diabetes Mellitus4.
Symptoms include:  Trouble with balance, numbness and 
tingling of extremities, dysesthesia, muscle weakness, 
burning or electric pain, vision changes, dizziness, etc.DOI Number: 10.5958/0973-5674.2019.00033.9 
     164      Indian Journal of Physiotherapy and Occupational Therapy, January-March 2019, Vol.13, No. 1
Various Scoring systems for diabetic neuropathy 
include:
 I. NSS:  Neuropathy Symptom Score- The NSS 
consists of 17 items, focusing on muscle 
weakness,	 five	on	sensory	disturbances	 and	four	
on autonomic symptoms.
 II. DNE:  Diabetic Neuropathy Examination Score 
is a four-item symptom score for diabetic 
neuropathy. The DNS score has the following 
items: (i) unsteadiness in walking, (ii) pain, 
burning or aching at legs or feet, (iii) prickling 
sensations in legs or feet, and (iv) numbness in 
legs or feet.
 III. NDS:  Neuropathy Disability Score- The 
instrument examines cranial nerves, muscle 
weakness,	 reflexes	and	sensations.	 The	scale	
consists of 35 items for testing left and right side 
of the body; score range from 0 to 4.
 IV . NIS-LL: 	Neuropathy	 Impairment	 Score	in	Lower	
Limbs:	The	NIS-LL	is	a	modified	version	of	the	
NDS to quantify diabetic PNP. The lower limb 
items of the NDS are used complemented with 2 
muscle	power	items	(toe	extension	and	toe	flexion).	
The	NIS-LL	has	14	items:	8	items	evaluate	muscle	
power	(0–4	points),	2	items	evaluate	reflexes	(0–2	
points), and 4 items evaluate sensory modalities 
(0–2	points).	All	items	are	tested	on	both	sides.	
The	maximum	score	is	88	points.
 V . MNSI:  Michigan Neuropathy Screening 
Instrument: The MNSI is an instrument including 
two parts a questionnaire including 15 questions 
and a foot examination. The questionnaire 
inquiries about positive (pain, temperature, 
sensation, tingling) and negative(numbness) 
sensory symptoms, cramps and muscle weakness, 
foot ulcers or cracks and amputation. Neuropathy 
can	be	defined	as	7	or	more	positive	responses	on	
the	MNSI	Questionnaire.
 VI. CE-V:  Clinical Examination Score of Valk: It is 
a composite scoring system for measurement of 
sensory	signs	and	reflexes	in	the	lower	limb.	
 VII. TSS:  Total Symptom Score: The Total Symptom 
Score evaluates individual neuropathy sensory 
symptoms in patients with diabetic peripheral 
neuropathy in clinical trials, with the intent of 
distinguishing a response to therapy.We	used	Michigan	Neuropathy	 Screening	Instrument	
for screening of Diabetic Neuropathy. The accuracy 
of MNSI scoring makes it a useful screening test for 
diabetic	neuropathy.	 High	specificity,	 likelihood	 ratios	
over 5 and a moderate to good post-test probability give 
a high diagnostic impact for MNSI scoring.  It includes 
two separate assessments: a 15-item self-administered 
“yes or no” questionnaire and a lower extremity 
examination that includes inspection and assessment of 
vibratory	sensation	and	ankle	reflexes5.
MATERIAL AND METHODOLOGY
Study Design: It was a population based cross-sectional 
study.
Sampling Method: The Convenient Sampling method 
was used.
Study Period: The study period extended from October 
2017	to	March	2018.
Sample Size: 96 samples were taken.
Study Setting: The present study was conducted among 
patients	with	type	2	DM	admitted	in	Female	&	Male	
Ortho	Ward,	Female	and	Male	Opthalmology	 Ward,	
Female	and	Male	Medicine	 Ward,	Male	&	Female	
Surgery	Ward	at	Dr.	Vitthalrao	 Vikhe	Patil	Memorial	
Hospital, Ahmednagar.Also door-to-door patients were 
taken with type 2 DM in Bhingar. Camps were also held 
at	Vadgoan	Gupta	&	Gulmohar	 Road,	Ahmednagar.	 The	
study also included patients with Type 2 DM attending 
Dr.	Bharat’s	Diabetic	Clinic	&	Foot	Care,	 Ahmednagar.
Written	Informed	 Consent	was	taken	from	all	
participants.
A data collection sheet was designed which 
included the demographic data like Name, Age, Sex, 
Socio-economic Status, Body Mass Index, History 
of	Hypertension/Hypercholestremia	 &	Duration	 of	
Diagnosis.
Study Tool: The screening for DPN was conducted 
using the Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument. 
The MNSI is a validated tool for the screening of DPN. 
The	MNSI	includes	two	parts,	the	first	part	is	related	to	
patient’s	perception	 of	symptoms	 in	relation	to	DPN	and	
the second part consists of a set of examinations done to 
detect the presence of DPN among the patients.
Indian Journal of Physiotherapy and Occupational Therapy, January-March 2019, Vol.13, No. 1          165      
 1. Foot Inspection:  The feet were inspected 
for evidence of excessively dry skin, callous 
formation,	 fissures,	frank	ulceration	or	deformities.
 2. Vibration Sensation:  Vibration sensation was 
tested	bilaterally	 using	a	128	Hz	tuning	fork	
placed over the dorsum of the great toe on the bony 
prominence	 of	the	DIP	joint.	Patients,	whose	eyes	
are closed, were asked to indicate when they can 
no longer sense the vibration from the vibrating 
tuning fork.
 3. Muscle Stretch Reflexes: 	For	the	reflex,	the	foot	
was	passively	positioned	 and	the	foot	dorsiflexed	
slightly to obtain optimal stretch of the muscle.  
The Achilles tendon was percussed directly. 
Reinforcement	 was	given	if	the	response	wasn’t	
obtained.
 4. Monofilament Testing: 	The	filament	was	applied	
to the dorsum of the great toe midway between 
the	nail	fold	and	the	DIP	joint.	The	filament	was	
applied	perpendicularly	 and	briefly,	(<1	second)	
with an even pressure. The patient, whose eyes are 
closed, was asked to respond yes if he/she feels 
the	filament.
Scoring for Michigan Neuropathy Screening 
Instrument
 a. History:  Responses were added to obtain the total 
score.	Responses	 of	“yes”	to	items	1-3,	5-6,	8-9,	
11-12, 14-15 was each counted as one point. A 
“no” response on items 7 and 13 was counted as 1 
point. Item #4 and item #10 were not included in 
scoring.
 b. Physical Assessment:  Vibration Sensation: 
Vibration was scored as 1) present if the examiner 
senses	the	vibration	on	his	or	her	finger	for	<	10	
seconds,	2)	reduced	if	sensed	for	≥	10	or	3)	absent	
(no vibration detection.)
Muscle Stretch Reflexes: 	If	the	reflex	is	obtained,	
it	was	graded	as	present.	If	the	reflex	was	absent,	the	
patient was asked to perform the Jendrassic maneuve, 
if	the	reflexes	elicited	with	the	Jendrassic	 maneuver	
alone were designated “present with reinforcement.”  If 
the	reflex	was	absent,	even	in	the	face	of	the	Jendrassic	
maneuver,	the	reflex	was	considered	absent.
Monofilment Testing:  The patient, whose eyes are 
closed, were asked to respond yes if he/she feels the filament.	Eight	correct	responses	out	of	10	applications	
was considered normal: one to seven correct responses 
indicates reduced sensation and no correct answers 
translates into absent sensation.
After summing up all the components if the overall 
score	was	found	to	be	≥2.5,	then	it	was	considered	 to	be	
positive for the presence of DPN.

DISCUSSION
The present study was conducted to determine 
the prevalence of diabetic neuropathy in Ahmednagar 
city. The present study reported the prevalence rate of 
diabetic neuropathy to be 6.25% with self-administered 
questionnaire	 score	>7	and	physical	assessment	 score	>2	
using the Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument 
which	correlates	 with	the	findings	of	a	study	done	in	
Manglore6.
The	difference	in	prevalence	 rates	using	two	methods	
is	an	important	 finding	and	it	clearly	demonstrates	
the	limitations	 related	to	patient’s	self-perception	 of	
symptoms of DPN. 
The prevalence of diabetic neuropathy was 50% 
more in women as compared to men with pure neuropathy which correlates with study done in Middle East.7 
whereas it was higher in men as compared to women 
with physical examination indicating neuropathy and the 
questionnaire score was less than 7. The reason for this 
prevalence is not clear. It might be due to less awareness 
of men of their symptoms regarding neuropathy or it 
may	be	due	to	less	involvement	 of	the	male	subjects	in	
the study due to random sampling.
Also, the prevalence of diabetic neuropathy in acute 
subjects	is	nil	whereas	for	subjects	having	diabetes	
for more than 6 months have higher prevalence of 
pure neuropathy as well as neuropathy with physical 
assessment	 score>2.	 It	correlates	 with	the	study	
conducted in Iran as well as in South India8,9	Also, a 
study conducted in Portugese concludes that Seventy-
two	(80%)	patients	had	symptoms	 of	polyneuropathy,	
but DPN was present only in 29 (32.2%). Calluses 
(37.8%)	and	trophic	skin	(74.4%)	and	nail	(75.6%)	
changes	were	found	in	both	feet.	There	was	a	significant	
positive association of DPN with age, disease duration, 
feet skin changes and myocardial infarction/ischemia10.
The prevalence of pure neuropathy in hypertensive 
subjects	is	12.5%	and	for	neuropathy	 with	only	physical	
assessment	 score>2	was	47.5%	which	indicates	that	
hypertension is a risk factor for developing neuropathy 
It	is	in	conjunction	 with	the	study	conducted	 in	
European countries which states that associations have 
been	identified	from	this	study	–	namely	with	elevated	
diastolic blood pressure (p < 0.05), the presence of 
severe ketoacidosis (p < 0.001), an increase in the levels 
of fasting triglyceride (p < 0.001), and the presence of 
microalbuminuria (p < 0.01).11
The prevalence of Diabetic Neuropathy in patients 
with hypercholestremia was found to be 50%. This 
result is supported by a study conducted in Pittsburg.12 
No	significant	 data	was	found	relating	the	two.	But	the	
most probable reason may be lack of exercise, excessive 
and	unhealthy	eating	habits	of	the	subjects	and	a	higher	
percentage	 of	prevalence	 maybe	due	to	lack	of	subjects	
suffering	from	hypercholestremias	 well	as	the	presence	
of macrovascular complications.
The prevalence of diabetic neuropathy in obese 
patients was found to be 13.63% in pure neuropathic 
patients whereas it is 50% for patients whose physical 
assessment score was more than 2. This is supported 
by a study which concludes that Duration of diabetes 
Indian Journal of Physiotherapy and Occupational Therapy, January-March 2019, Vol.13, No. 1          167      
(p less than 0.001), age (p less than 0.05), and ethanol 
use (p less than 0.05) were also associated. These data 
strongly	suggest	that	body	stature	is	a	major	risk	factor	
for diabetic sensory neuropathy.13
The prevalence of diabetic neuropathy in low socio 
-economic	 status	was	found	to	be	20.83%.		The	reason	for	
this is lack of awareness regarding diabetic neuropathy. 
Lack	of	nutrition,	proper	medical	care	and	less	awareness	
about DPN has contributed to a prevalence of 20% of 
diabetic neuropathy. The similar result was shown by a 
study	conducted	in	Sri	Lanka.14
The limitation of the study was since most of 
the	study	was	conducted	 in	the	community	 it	wasn’t	
possible to administer NCV tests. Another limitation 
was that the prevalence of diabetic neuropathy was not 
separately	 found	in	diabetic	patients	who	didn’t	suffer	
from hypertension, hypercholestremia, patients with 
normal	BMI	&	with	a	good	socio-economic	 status.	Also	
the	patients	weren’t	asked	about	medications	 for	DM,	
hypertension or hypercholestremia.
CONCLUSION
Diabetic Neuropathy is a nerve damaging disorder 
associated with Diabetes Mellitus. Thus, the study 
concluded that there is moderate prevalence of diabetic 
neuropathy amongst diabetic people in Ahmednagar City 
and more and more awareness is necessary to reduce 
the chances of disability. It also concluded that there 
is a high prevalence of diabetic neuropathy in females, 
people	with	chronic	diabetes,	hypertensive,	 suffering	
from hypercholestremia, obese and with a low socio-
economic status. Control of the blood glucose level, 
modification	 of	lifestyle,	physical	activity	and	diet	play	
a	major	role	in	reducing	the	risk	of	diabetic	neuropathy.

ABSTRACT
Background: 	Heart	rate	recovery	after	graded	exercise	is	one	of	the	commonly	 used	techniques	 that	reflects	
the autonomic activity and predicts cardiovascular events and mortality, not only in cardiovascular system 
disorders, but also in various systemic disorders. Hence, this study was taken up to provide a normative data 
for heart rate recovery after submaximal exercise in normal healthy individuals so that patients with mild 
affection	can	be	identified	at	much	early	stage.
Material and Methodology:  In this cross sectional analytical study 100 patients in the age group of 40-60 
years	were	included	and	divided	age	and	gender	wise	in	a	group	of	25(40-50years	 &	51-60years)	 and	50(40-
60F&M)	respectively.	 Subjects	with	visual	ailments,	any	cardio	vascular	or	respiratory	 disease,	fractures	
or neurological problems which may interfere with the walking ability were excluded from the study. The 
ethical	clearance	was	obtained	from	IEC	of	DVVPF’s	 COPT	for	study.	After	ethical	clearance,	 a	written	
informed consent was obtained from participants, the whole procedure was explained and human activity 
profile	questionnaire	was	filled	by	the	patients.
Result:  The mean of all the parameters was calculated and then the distance walked was correlated with all 
the	parameters	 to	determine	 its	significance	 through	nonparametric	 correlation	 in	age	wise	and	gender	wise	
classification.	 When	the	means	of	the	HRR1	were	compared	 in	the	age	group	of	40-50F (6.24±2.818) & 
51-60F (9.32±3.827) the p value was found to be  0.0022	which	was	considered	 very	significant.	 Also,	when

Heart rate recovery is the speed at which your 
heart rate returns to normal after exercise, can indicate 
physical cardiac condition and risk of certain diseases.
[1]It is concluded that post exertion heart rate recovery 
is closely related to the vagal tone modulation and thus its abnormality is a simple and reliable tool to assess 
decrease of vagal activity.[2] According to the New 
England Journal of Medicine , people whose heart 
rate recovery time is long are at a higher risk of death 
than people with shorter recovery times regardless of 
physical condition or other risk factors.[1] According 
to the National Emergency Medicine Association , 
measuring heart rate recovery rates is one way to tell 
whether	an	exercise	program	is	effective.[1] The failure of 
the heart rate to decline at 1 or 2 minutes post exercise, 
is associated with increased mortality.[4]Exercise training 
has been associated with improvement in cardiovascular 
capacity in older people but, whether exercise training 
influences	 HRR	in	older	people	is	still	unknown.DOI Number: 10.5958/0973-5674.2019.00034.0

[3]	Patients	suffering	from	various	cardiovascular	 or	
respiratory conditions have a direct impact on their 
HRR post exercise. For instance, idiopathic pulmonary 
fibrosis(IPF)	 is	a	severe,	progressive	 fibrosing	interstitial	
lung disease.[6]The ability to better predict outcome 
with exercise testing in patients with heart failure(HF) 
and left ventricular systolic dysfunction may prove 
extremely valuable in determining which patients are at 
increased risk.[15] A stronger heart is able to push more 
blood	through	than	a	weaker	one,	so	fitter	people	tend	
to have lower heart rates.[7] Hence,	HRR		is	a	significant	
predictor of mortality in patients with HF and patients 
with	LVSD	and	maybe	useful	in	better	determining	
prognosis.[15] In chronic respiratory entities abnormal 
autonomic cardiac response could be consequence of 
a lower parasympathetic activation and/or increased 
sympathetic tone, being widely accepted that 
parasympathetic activations plays a protective role.[5]
Six	minute	walk	test(6MWT)	 is	a	simple,	
submaximal	 and	objective	measurement	 of	functional	
capacity.	The	time-distance	 walk	was	first	introduced	
by	Balke	in	1960’s	as	a	straightforward	 and	objective	
measure of functional capacity.[8] The test simply 
required a patient to walk as far as they could in a set 
period of time with the primary outcome measure 
being the total distanced walked in the time allotted.[8] 
Cooper	modified	it	into	a	12	minute	walk	test.[9] In	1892	
Butland and colleagues compared 2, 6, and 12 minute 
walk test and determined that the 6 minute walk test is 
strongly correlated with 12 minute walk test.[10]In	1985	
it	was	first	introduced	 in	patients	with	heart	disease	by	
Guyatt	et	al.[11]	The	6MWT	is	often	used	at	the	beginning	
of	the	rehabilitation	 programs	to	determine	 a	patient’s	
exercise capacity and at the end to assess the degree 
of improvement.[12]As	aerobic	fitness	improves	for	the	
person, the HRR must also improve.
The	strongest	indication	for	the	6MWT	is	measuring	
the response to medical interventions in patients with 
moderate to severe heart and lung disease. In some 
clinical	situations,	 the	6MWT	provides	information	 that	
may	be	a	better	index	of	the	patient’s	ability	to	perform	
daily activities than is peak oxygen uptake. However, 
the limitations of the test are that it does not determine 
peak oxygen uptake, diagnose the cause of dyspnea 
on exertion, or evaluate the causes or mechanisms of 
exercise	limitation.	 Indications	 for	6MWT	are	as	follows:Lung	transplantation[16]
Lung	volume	reduction	surgery[17,18]
Pulmonary rehabilitation[19]
COPD[20,21]
Heart failure[22]
Cystic	fibrosis[23]
Older patients[24]
Primary pulmonary hypertension[16]
Absolute	contraindications	 for	the	6MWT	include	
the following: unstable angina during the previous 
month and myocardial infarction during the previous 
month.	Whereas,	 relative	contraindications	 include	a	
resting	HR	of	>120,	a	systolic	BP	of	>180mmHg,	 and	
a	diastolic	BP	of	>100mmHg.	 Stable	angina	is	not	an	
absolute	contraindication	 for	a	6MWT,	but	patients	with	
these symptoms should perform the test after using their 
antianginal medication. Reasons considered to cease the 
test include the following: 1)chest pain 2)intolerable 
dyspnea, 3)leg cramps, 4)staggering 5)pale or ashen 
appearance. Heart rate recovery after graded exercise is 
one of the common methods that predicts abnormality, 
not only in cardiovascular system disorders, but also in 
various systemic disorders.[13]  Therefore, in this study 
the	effect	of	exercise	testing	on	HRR	is	being	evaluated	
in	elderly	subjects	to	determine	 normative	 values	for	the	
heart rate recovery after 6 minute walk test in normal 
healthy individuals.[3]
MATERIALS & METHODOLOGY
A cross sectional analytical study was carried out at 
the physiotherapy OPD in Vikhe Patil Memorial Hospital, 
Ahmednagar	 district	where	in	100	healthy	subjects	
were selected between the age group of 40-60 years by 
convenience sampling method. The study was carried 
out	in	the	duration	of	6	months	(sept	2017-feb2018).	
Materials required for the study: 2 Cones, a stopwatch, 
a	measuring	 tape,	a	chair	and	a	fitbit	wrist	tracker	to	
measure	the	heart	rate.	Subjects	that	were	physically	
active and could walk independently for minimum 10 
minutes and were cognitively sound to understand the 
given	instructions	 were	included.	Subjects	with	visual	
ailments, any cardio vascular or respiratory disease, 
fractures or neurological problems which may interfere 
with walking ability and uncooperative or unwilling 
patients were excluded from the study. The study was 
Indian Journal of Physiotherapy and Occupational Therapy, January-March 2019, Vol.13, No. 1          171      
carried	out	after	approval	from	the	IEC	of	DVVPF’s	
College of Physiotherapy, Ahmednagar. The nature and 
purpose	of	the	study	was	explained	to	the	subjects	and	a	
written consent was taken from them. A data collection 
sheet	was	filled	by	the	therapist	wherein	details	such	
as	subject’s	name,	age,	sex,	address,	HRR,	distance	
covered,	human	activity	profile	score	was	mentioned.
PROCEDURE
Subjects	were	instructed	 to	wear	comfortable	
clothes.	All	the	subjects	were	asked	to	relax	and	not	to	
do	any	strenuous	 task	prior	to	the	test.	Subjects	were	
explained	 about	the	test	and	its	benefits.	Precautions	
were taken prior to the test so that no harm was caused 
to	the	subject	while	the	test	was	on.	Shoes	worn	
were appropriate and of the proper size for walking. 
Subjects	used	their	usual	walking	aids	during	the	test. 
The	subject’s	usual	medical	regimen	was	continued.  
A light meal was acceptable before early morning or 
early afternoon tests.  Subjects	were	told	not	to	exercise	
vigorously within 2 hours as that may interfere with the 
results of the test.  The	subject	sat	in	a	chair	in	a	relaxed	
position, located near the starting point, for at least 10 
minutes prior to the beginning of the test.  Baseline heart 
rate was measured. Instructions given before the test 
commenced	 were:	the	subject	has	to	walk	a	distance	of	
60m.  He was instructed to walk in his normal speed and 
not increase his pace or run at any point.  He had to walk 
back and forth around the cones.  If	the	subject	at	any	
point felt breathless, immediately he was given a chair 
to sit. But during this time the timer was kept going on.  
Subjects	were	encouraged	 to	walk	and	complete	the	test	
by telling them about the remaining time and how well 
were they doing it.  After the completion of test, a chair 
was given to the patient to rest and immediately HR was 
measured	in	the	fitbit	wrist	tracker.  Then after 1and 3 
minutes	heart	rate	was	measured	 and	the	difference	
between the immediate and the heart rate after 1 minute 
and 3 minutes was calculated.  This determined the heart 
rate recovery.
6 minute walk test: The	6	minute	walk	test	(6MWT)	has	
gained widespread use in cardiopulmonary rehabilitation 
programs	as	one	measure	of	fitness.	Most	of	the	time	
the	subject	does	not	attain	his	maximal	exercise	capacity	during	the	6MWT;	instead	they	adjust	their	own	intensity	
of exercise and can rest or stop according to their will. 
However, as most of the daily activities are performed 
at submaximal levels of exertion, the 6 minute walk 
distance	may	better	reflect	the	functional	 exercise	level	
for daily activities.
Human Activity Profile: 	The	human	activity	profile	
(HAP) was originally developed to measure the quality 
of life achieved by patients in rehabilitation programs 
and used as a measure of activity level in a variety of 
healthy and impaired populations. The activity items of 
the HAP are based on estimated metabolic equivalents 
(METs). One MET is the approximate amount of oxygen 
consumed by an average person at rest. The HAP 
comprises of 94 self-report items. Each item represents 
a common activity requiring a known amount of average 
energy expenditure (i.e. MET). Items with the lowest 
item numbers (e.g. Items1,2) have the lowest MET 
requirements, while items with the highest item numbers 
(e.g. Items 93,94) have the highest MET requirements. 
The respondent answers each item with one of three 
possible responses: Still Doing  This Activity; Have 
Stopped Doing This Activity; or Never Did This Activity . 
The	different	variables	in	HAP	scale	are:	Maximum	
Activity Score(MAS) is the highest oxygen-demanding 
activity that the respondent still performs, which 
interprets	 that	it	is	the	best	estimate	of	respondent’s	
highest level of energy expenditure, in comparison 
with	peers	of	same	age	and	gender.	Adjusted	Activity	
Score(AAS) is a measure of usual daily activities that 
means	it	is	the	best	estimate	of	respondent’s	 average	level	
of energy expenditure. Activity Age is the age at which 
50% of healthy adults of a given age and sex surpass 
a given MAS which provides an age equivalent for the 
respondent’s	 activity	level.	Fitness	classification(FC)	 is	
a	translation	 of	AAS	into	a	general	classification	 of	the	
respondent’s	 level	of	fitness	and	thus	provides	a	general	
classification	 of	fitness	level	in	comparison	 with	peers	
of	same	age	and	gender.	Activity	classification(AC)	 is	a	
translation	 of	the	AAS	into	a	general	classification	 of	the	
respondent’s	 level	of	activity	and	thus	provides	a	general	
classification	 of	activity	level	in	comparison	 with	peers	
of same age and gender.

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Data was presented as mean and standard deviation. 
The data was calculated using the nonparametric 
correlation (Spearman). Statistical analysis was 
performed	using	Graphpad	instat3	software.
DISCUSSION
In the last decade, many studies have been conducted 
to	evaluate	the	6MWT	in	healthy	adults	in	order	to	provide	
reference	values	for	the	6MWD.					 In	the	present	study,	
a cross-sectional design in the age group 40-60years (40-
50f:25, 40-50m:25, 51-60f:25, 51-60m:25). It was found 
that in gender wise classification the mean distance 
walked in the age group of 40-60 years of females  was 
382.8 ±44.769 . All the means in age and gender wise 
classifications	 of	HAP	parameters	 are	mentioned	 in	table	
no.1&2	respectively.	 The	correlation	 values	of	the	distance	
with	the	HAP 	parameters	are	mentioned	in	table	no.5&6.Further it was seen that heart rate recovery after 
exercise	reflects	changes	in	the	autonomic	 tone	
of sympathetic withdrawal and parasympathetic 
reactivation. It also has certain prognostic implication. In 
the	present	study	no	significant	 relationship	 was	found	
between	HRR1	and	distance	covered	by	the	subject	
and HRR3 and the distance. This is probably due to 
the fact that the distance covered did not stimulate the 
sympathetic	 and	parasympathetic	 activity	as	the	subjects	
were allowed to walk at their pace and did not exert too 
much during the activity. However, in the age group of 
40-60 years of females 	there	was	a	significant(p=0.0472) 	
correlation between HRR1 and the distance covered. This 
is probably explained by the fact that in females there is 
early stimulation of parasympathetic activity due to the 
factors playing the role in the menopausal state. Due 
to the lack of estrogen, progesterone and testosterone, 
parasympathetic activity gets disturbed and hence 
may	affect	its	stimulation.	 Activity	age	according	 to	
human	activity	profile(HAP)	 index	is	an	age	equivalent	
for the respondents activity level, is found to have 
Indian Journal of Physiotherapy and Occupational Therapy, January-March 2019, Vol.13, No. 1          175      
significant	 correlation	 with	distance	in	case	of	females 
in the age range of 40-60 years  i.e, it was extremely 
significant(p=<0.0001).	 This	is	probably	due	to	the	fact	
that physical activity of an individual is dependent on 
his physiological age as it needs the balance of various 
systems in the body.  Similar pattern was observed when 
distance	was	correlated	 with	fitness	classification	 and	
activity	classification.	 This	is	probably	due	to	the	fact	that	
fitness	classification	 and	activity	classification	 according	
to	human	activity	profile	index	is	a	general	classification 	
of	fitness	level	and	activity	level	in	comparison	 with	
peers of same age and gender.

CONCLUSION
The	study	concludes	 that	there	is	no	significant	
relationship between the HRR1 and the distance covered 
and between HRR3 and the distance covered except for 
in the age group of 40-60 years females where it was 
found	to	be	significant.
