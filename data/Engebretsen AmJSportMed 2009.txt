Abstract  
Objective:  Survey on the frequency, characteristic s and causes of injuries incurred in 
competition and/or training duri ng the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games.  
Design: Prospective recording of injuries. 
Setting: 29th Olympic Games 2008 in Beijing, China. 
Participants: National team physicians or responsible  Chief Medical Officers of 92 national 
teams with 9672 (88%) athletes; a ll physicians of the medical stations at the Olympic venues and 
of the polyclinic in the Olympic village. 
Main Outcome Measures:  Frequency, characteristics and causes of injuries.   
Results: 1055 injuries were reported, resulting in an incidence of 96.1 injuries per 1000 
registered athletes. About half of  the injuries (49.6%) we re expected to prevent the athlete from 
participating in competition or training. The most prevalent diagnoses were ankle sprains and thigh strains. A quarter of the injuries were incurred during training and 72.5% in competition. One third of the injuries were caused by contact with another athlete, fo llowed by overuse (22%) 
and non-contact incidences (20%). Injuries were reported from all sports but their incidence and 
characteristics varied substantiall y. In relation to the number of re gistered athletes, the risk of 
incurring an injury was highest in taekw ondo, football, hockey, handball, weightlifting and 
boxing (all >
15% of the athletes), and lowest for sailing, canoe/kayak, rowing, synchronised 
swimming, diving, fencing and swimming. Conclusion: The data indicate that the injury survei llance system covered almost all of the 
participating athletes, and the results highlight areas  of high risk for sport injury such as the in-
competition period, the ankle and thigh, and specifi c sports. The identification of these factors 
should stimulate future research an d subsequent policy change to prevent injury in elite athletes.

INTRODUCTION  
 
The Olympic Games are the largest world sport event with over 10´000 pa rticipating athletes 
from more than 200 countries. The International Olympic Co mmittee (IOC) is increasingly 
emphasising the protection of the athletes’ health and the prevention of injuries. As has been shown previously,
1 2 standardized assessment of sports injuries provides not only important 
epidemiological information, but also directions  for injury prevention, and the opportunity for 
monitoring long-term changes in the frequency and circumstances of injur y. As part of a long-
term sports injury prevention project, the IO C decided to conduct an injury surveillance study 
during the Olympic Games 2008 in Beijing.  
 
Injury surveillance studies have been performed in several single-sports tournaments, such as 
football,1 3-8 rugby,9-13 karate,14-16 ice hockey,17 18 volleyball,19 beach volleyball,20 handball,21 
tennis,22 cycling,23 and athletics24. For multi-sport events, however only eight studies were found 
in the literature, including three on disabled athletes.25-27 
 Martin et al
28 registered all medical contacts and encount ers due to injuries and illnesses of 3028 
athletes who participated in the 1985 Junior Olympics in 13 different sports. Laskowski et al29 
analysed all medical contacts and treatment requir ed by the 6243 participants  in 21 sports at the 
1994 Star of the North Summer Games. Cunningham and Cunningham30 surveyed the injuries of 
5106 participants competing in 19  sports during the 1994 Austra lian University Games. Greene 
and Bernhardt31 studied the injuries of 31580 athletes pa rticipating in ten sports of the Badger 
States Summer Games of three consecutive years 1994-96.   
During the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens,
32 the incidence and characteristics of injuries in all 
eight team sport tournaments (f ootball, handball, basketball, fi eld hockey, baseball, softball, 
water polo and volleyball) were recorded using an injury surveillance system established in 
football1 2 4-7 and handball.21 Since the compliance with the procedure was excellent and the 
quality of the data obtained high,32 the injury surveillance system was modified to be applicable 
for both individual and team sports.33 The IOC injury surveillance system proved feasible and 
useful for individual sports in a pilot study during the 11th World Championship in Athletics.24 
 
The aim of the present study was to analyse the fr equency, characteristics and causes of injuries 
incurred in competitions and/or traini ng during the Olympic Games 2008 in Beijing.

A detailed description of the applied methodol ogy has been published by the Beijing Olympics 
Study Group.33 In summary, the physicians and/or Ch ief Medial Officers of the National 
Olympic Committees (NOCs) were asked to report  daily all newly incurred injuries (or the non-
occurrence of injuries) on a standardised injury re port form. Injuries were additionally reported 
by the Local Organising Committee (LOC) physicians at the medical  stations at the different 
Olympic venues and at the polyclinic in the Olympic Village.   
Definition of Injury  
An injury was defined as any musculo-skeletal complaint (traumatic and overuse) newly incurred 
due to competition and/or training during period of  the XXIX. Olympiad in Beijing that received 
medical attention regardless of the consequences with respect to absence from competition or 
training.
33 This injury definition includes five aspect s: (a) all injuries that received medical 
attention (not only time-loss injuries), (b) newly incurred (pre-existing, not fully rehabilitated 
injuries should not be reported;  re-injuries (injurie s of the same location and type) should be 
reported only if the athlete has retu rned to full participation afte r the previous injury), (c) in-
competition and training injuries, (d) during the Olympic Games (9 to 24 August 2008, except 
football, for details see “Implementation”), and (e ) exclusion of illnesses and diseases. If multiple 
body parts were injured or multiple types of inju ry in the same body part were incurred in one 
incident, this is counted as one injury with two diagnoses.33  
 
Injury report form  
The injury report form33 required documentation of the fo llowing information: athlete’s 
accreditation number, sport/discipline, round/heat/t raining, date and time of injury, injured body 
part, type and cause of injury and estimated duration of the subsequent absence from competition 
and/or training. Definitions of th ese parameters were stated on th e back of the form. The injury 
report form was available in seven languages (English, French, Chinese, Spanish, German, 
Russian, Arabic). The English version is published elsewhere.33 
 
Confidentiality and ethical approval  
The athletes’ accreditation number  was only used to avoid duplicate reporting from NOC and 
LOC physicians, and to provide information on age,  gender, sport and national federation of the 
athlete from the IOC database. All information wa s treated strictly confidential, and the injury 
reports were made anonymous afte r the Olympic Games. Ethical a pproval was obtained from the 
Oslo University School of Medicine Ethical Committee. 
 
Implementation and data collection 
Three months prior the 2008 Olympic Games, the NOCs were informed about the study by the 
IOC. The medical representatives of all part icipating NOCs received a booklet with detailed 
information on the study one month before the Ga mes and were requested to participate in the 
project. All NOC physicians and therapists and the chairpersons of the Medical Commissions of 
the Summer Olympic International Sports Federatio ns were invited to an instructional meeting 
two days prior the opening of the Games in Be ijing. During this meeting the NOC physicians 
were informed about the background and aims of the study, and instructed on the completion and 
return of the injury report form by the Study Gro up. Questions of the partic ipants were answered, 
and the instructional booklet and the injury repo rt forms were distributed. During the Olympic 
Games, members of the Study Group repeatedly met with or phoned the physicians of NOCs with 
more than 50 athletes to motivate daily compliance with form submission. 
 
In general, the NOC chief physician was responsible for reporting the injuries of their athletes. 
For a few large NOCs more than one physician retu rned injury report forms (for calculation of 
response rate and coverage, these were counted as  one report form). One NOC returned all forms 
at the last day of the Games. One NOC did not re port the injuries in a specific sport, another 
NOC reported only injuries in two sports. Th e NOC physicians could submit the completed 
injury report forms to a locked mailbox at the IOC Medical Commission o ffice in the Polyclinic 
of the Olympic Village, or submit them by ema il or fax to the IOC study office in Beijing. For 
football, the collection of the forms was slightly  different since the ma tches started prior the 
official opening, most venues were not in Beijin g and all football team had their own physician. 
Following the established procedure in FIFA competitions,1 2 4 6 7 the forms were collected after 
each match by the FIFA Medical Officer at the venue and returned to the IOC study office.  
 
In order to receive also information about inju red athletes of NOCs that  did not have a team 
physician or therapist, injuries re ports were additionally collected fr om the medical stations at the 
38 different Olympic venues and the polyclinic in the Olympic Village. Medical stations at the 
venues were requested to report on a slightly modified injury report form (additional info on 
NOC of the injured athlete) on all days a competition took place in  the respective venue. During 
the Games, a member of the Study Group visited th e medical stations at the different venues in 
Beijing to instruct them on accurate completion of  the forms and to motivate daily compliance of 
submission. Venues outside Beijing (football, saili ng, equestrian) were contacted via email and 
phone. Daily injury information was also received  from the polyclinic in the Olympic Village. 
However, this information was extracted from the local database and included only accreditation 
number of the athlete, location and type of  injury. Thus, information on circumstance 
(competition/training) and cause of injury and resulting time-loss in sport are missing for these injuries. In case of duplicate reporting, informa tion from the NOC physici an was preferred to 
LOC physician´s report, and information from the venue and polyclinics were summarized. 
 
Data analysis  
The IOC provided a list of athletes registered for the 2008 Olympic Games; the competition 
schedule was available on the internet (http:/ /en.beijing2008.cn). The response rate of the NOC 
physicians was determined by dividing the number of received forms by the number of expected forms (number of NOCs which returned at least one  injury report form multiplied with 16 days). 
The coverage of athletes and of  injuries was assessed regarding the number of athletes in the 
respective NOC in the analysis, and comparing the proportion of injuries reported by NOC 
physicians and other sources for NOC s of different sizes. The differe nt mode of data collection in 
football and the reduced number of athletes re ported on in two NOCs were regarded in these 
calculations.  
All data were processed using Excel and SPSS. Statistical methods app lied were descriptive 
statistics, frequencies, cross-tabulations, t-test and chi2-test. Significance was accepted at p<0.05.  
 
 
RESULTS  
 
Response rate and coverage of athletes  
The physicians or responsible therapists of 92 national teams with 9672 (88%) athletes took part 
in the study and returned a total 1314 injury report forms. With re spect to the returned forms the 
average response rate of 75.1%, but regarding the number of at hletes covered by the team 
physicians´ reports the response ra te was 79.9%. In relation to all registered athletes the daily 
coverage by team physicians´ reports was 69.1% . In addition, 264 (72.5%) reports from medical 
stations at the different Olympi c venues and all daily reports from the polyclinic in the Olympic 
Village were received.

The coverage of athletes by NOC physicians corresponded closely to the amount of injuries they 
reported (for details see Table 1). Overall, 787 (74.6%) injuries were reported by the NOC physicians, 16 by medical representatives of the international sport federa tion at the venue, 127 
injuries from medical stations at the venues and 234 from the pol yclinic (109 in juries by more 
than one source of informati on). The percentage of injuri es reported by NOC physicians 
decreased with the size of the national team, si nce small teams often do not include a physician.  
 
Frequency and diagnosis of injuries  
A total of 1055 injuries were reported, equiva lent to an incidence of 96.1 injuries per 1000 
registered athletes. Since 46 injuries had multiple locations or types, 1108 diagnoses were named 
(for details see table 2). The most prevalent di agnoses were ankle sprain s (n=81; 7.3%) and thigh 
strain (n=75; 6.8%). About half of the diagnos es (n=600; 54.2%) affected the lower extremity, 
upper extremity (n=218; 19.7%), trunk (n=176; 16.1%) and head (104; 94%). Thigh (13.3%) and 
knee (12.1%) were most commonly injured, followed by the lower leg and ankle. Head injuries (9.5%) were also frequent, mainly diagnos ed as skin lesions or contusions.

Circumstances and causes of injury  
Information on circumstance and cause of injury was available for 858 (81.3%) injuries. The 
majority of injuries (n= 623; 72.6%) were in curred in competition, te n during warm-up for 
competition and 225 (26.2%) during training. The injuries incurred during warm-up prior to 
competition were analysed as injuries during co mpetition. Injuries in training and in competition 
differed significantly in all inju ry characteristics (location, type , cause and subsequent time-loss 
from sport) and with regard to the diffe rent sports (for details see Table 3).  
 One third of the injuries (n= 282; 32.9%) was caused by contact with another athlete. Non-
contact trauma (n=172; 20.0%) an d overuse either w ith gradual (n= 78; 9.1%) or sudden onset 
(n=110; 12.8%) were also frequent causes of injury. Some injuries  were due to contact with an 
object (n= 115; 13.4%) and r ecurrence of previous in jury (n=47; 5.5%). Othe r potential causes of 
injury (playing field conditions (n=15), weather conditions (n= 8), equipment failure (n=5), 
others (18)) were rarely stated.  
 
Time-loss from sport after injury  
Information in relation to time-loss from sport after injury was availabl e for 844 (80%) injuries. 
About half of the injuries (n=419;  49.6%) were expected to preven t the athlete from participating 
in competition or training. Physicians estimate d that 275 (33.0%) injuries would result in an 
absence from sports up to one week, 93 (11.2%) in an absence for more than  a week but less than 
a month and 41 (4.9%) for more than 28 days abse nce. In ten cases the duration of absence was 
not specified.  
 The 41 injuries with an estimated time-loss of  more than four weeks was comprised of 13 
fractures (foot (n= 4), clavicle (n= 3), knee (n= 2), arm, wrist, hand and pelvis), eight ligament 
ruptures (knee (n= 6), ankle (n= 2)), five dislocations (shoulder  (n= 2), knee, elbow and wrist), 
three ruptures of Achilles tendon, three sprains (a nkle, knee and shoulder), six muscle injuries 
(thigh (n= 4), hip and lower leg), two complex lesions of the joints (shoulder, knee) and one 
concussion. Out of the 221 injuries for which in formation about time-loss was not specified at 
least further 22 were suspected to be severe base d on the type of injury (10 fractures, 8 ligament 
ruptures, 4 complex injuries with ligament ruptures). 
 
Injuries in different sports  
Injuries were reported from all sports (for deta ils see Table 3). In relation to the number of 
registered athletes, the risk of incurring an injury was highest in football, taekwondo, field 
hockey, handball, weightlifting and boxing; and lowest for sailing, canoe/kayak, rowing, 
synchronised swimming, di ving, fencing and swimming. 
 For most sports, injuries in training and competition were reported, but in substantially different 
proportions. No in-competition injury was reported from archery, canoe/kayak, diving shooting 
and synchronised swimming. Although incidence of in juries in these spor ts was low, it is 
interesting to note that training  injuries were reported. The pr oportion of trainings injuries was 
high in table tennis, tennis, swimming, gymnastics, beach volle yball, equestrian, modern 
pentathlon and athletics. A high percentage of competitions injuries were incurred in boxing, 
water polo, hockey, handball weig htlifting, baseball and judo.  
 Consequently, also the causes of injury differed between the sports. Overuse was a frequent cause (>40% of the injuries) in rowing, modern pentat hlon, sailing, shooting, tennis, beach volleyball, 
triathlon, athletics, weightlifti ng, swimming and badminton. Contact with another athlete was the 
cause of more than 50% of the injuries in boxing, judo, water polo, handball, taekwondo, 
wrestling and football. In baseball and hockey contact with a moving object (ball, stick) was the cause in more than half of the injuries. A non-c ontact trauma was frequently incurred by cyclists, 
riders, shooters, tennis, and volleyball players.  Time-loss injuries were reported from all sports  except canoe flat-wat er, diving, sailing and 
synchronised swimming. The risk of incurring a time-loss injury was highest in football, 
taekwondo, handball, weightlifting, boxing, tr iathlon, and athletics (see table 3).

(b) information missing for 197 injuries 
 
The fractures were incurred by six (4.8%) taekwondo, five (1.8% ) boxers, ten ( 0.5%) track and 
field athletes, two track cyclists , two gymnasts, two judoka, two tria thlon athletes, one rider, one 
synchronised swimmer, one wrestler, six (1.2%) f ootball, four (3.0%) handball, two hockey, two 
water polo, two volleyball, one softball and one table tennis player. The dislocations and ruptures 
of tendon or ligament affected four (3.2%)  taekwondo, eight (2.1 %) judoka, five (2.0%) 
weightlifter, five (1.5%) wres tler, seven (0.3%) track and fi eld athlete, two BMX and one 
mountain bike cyclists, a boxer, a diver, a fencer , a triathlon athlete, seven (2.1%) handball, four 
(1.4%) basketball, five (1.3%) hockey, three (0.6%) football, two volleyball, a baseball, a 
badminton, a beach volleyball, a table tennis and a water polo player. Conc ussions were reported 
from boxing (n= 2; 0.7%), football (n= 3; 0.6%), baseball, basketball, hoc key judo, taekwondo, 
cycling road and slalom canoe/kayak (each n=1). 
  
Age and gender of injured athletes 
The age of the injured athletes ranged betwee n 15 and 53 years with no significant difference 
between men and women (mean= 25.7; sd= 4.75; missing: 122). In 549 (54.2%) cases the gender 
of the injured athlete was male and in 464 ( 45.8%) female (missing: 42). These characteristics 
were similar to the age (mean= 25.9; sd= 5.48; range: 12-67) and gender distribution of all 
registered athletes (male: 57.6%; female: 42.4%). 
  
D
ISCUSSION  
 
This study aimed to analyse all sp orts injuries of athletes participating in the Olympic Games 
2008. To the authors’ knowledge th is is the first surv ey on injuries during the Olympic Games 
including all sports.  The injury surveillance system
32 proved to be accepted by the NOC and the LOC medical 
personnel and to be feasible in a large multi-spor t event. The data indicate that the injury 
surveillance system covered almost all participat ing athletes. The NOC physicians and therapists 
of 92 national teams covering 88% of the register ed athletes took part in the study. The NOCs 
with more than fifty athletes returned 80% of the daily injury report forms. For NOCs with less 
than fifty athletes, the response rate was lower,  because some reported only if an athlete was 
injured. In addition to the injury reports from the NOCs, daily reports were received from the 
medical stations at the Olympic venues and the polyclinic in the Olympic Village. The 
percentage of injuries reported from the venues and the polyclinic increased for NOCs with fewer 
athletes, since small NOCs often do not have medical personnel. The tota l rate of injuries 
increased from large NOCs to smaller NOCs, proba bly for the same reason. It is assumed that 
due to the lack of own medical care in smaller teams, the athl etes had more injuries and/or 
consulted the medical facilities offered during the Olympics also for pre-existing injuries.  
However, since athletes from NOC with less than  ten athletes represente d less than 5% of the 
total population, this bias can be neglected. On the other hand, some participating NOCs and 
some medical stations at the Olympic venues did not return forms on all days. Thus, it is 
estimated that the injury incidence is slightly higher than reported.  
 
Approximately 10% of registered athletes incu rred an injury during the 2008 Olympic Games. 
This injury rate was co nsiderably lower than those of the 1985 Junior Olympic Games (25% of 
2871 athletes sought medical attention)28 and of the 1994 Australian University Games (19.5% of 
5106 athletes incurred an injury which required medical attention),30 but substantially higher than 
for the 1994 North Summer Games (55 of 6243 athletes received medical attention)29 and for the 
Badger States Summer Games 199-96 (285 of 31,580 athletes suffered a reportable injury)31. 
Although these studies surveyed injuries in larg e multi-sport events, the characteristics of the 
athletes varied substantially between them and to the present study. Therefore, a comparison can 
only demonstrate the wide range of injury rates in different sport events. Only one study on 
sports injuries during the Olym pic Games was found in literature.32 At the 2004 Olympic Games 
in Athens, all injuries incurred during team sports competitions were recorded using the same 
injury definition and a simila r mode of data collection.32 33 The total number of matches (2004: 
488; 2008: 498) as well as the number of all in -competition injuries (2004: 378; 2008: 333) and 
time-loss injuries in competition (2004: 147; 2008: 150) were similar in the 2004 Olympic 
Games and the present study. With respect to the si ngle sports, the number of time-loss injuries in 
competition was similar in the 2004 and the 2008 Olympics for football, handball, baseball, 
softball and water polo; lower for basketball (which  might be partly due to a rule change) and 
field hockey, and higher for volleyball. In compar ison to previous studies using a similar injury 
definition and surveillance system during single spor ts tournaments, comparable injury rates have 
been reported for football, 1 4 6 7 handball21 and athletics24. 
 
About half of the injuries affect ed the lower extremity, with contusions, sprains and strains being 
the most common types. This is in agreemen t with most publications  on sports injuries.28 29 30 31 
32 The diagnoses covered a wide spectrum, however ankle sprains and thigh strain were the most 
prevalent diagnoses as usua lly in sport. It is worth to mention, that 10 % of the injuries affected 
the head, mainly diagnosed as skin lesions or contusions, but also tw elve concussions were 
reported. The risk of concussion is a major concer n in certain sport, an d it diagnosis, treatment 
and return-to-play gui delines have been the focus of  recent consensus statements.34 35 About half 
of the injuries were reported to result in time -loss from sport, which is comparable to other 
studies using the same injury definition and similar assessment methods. 1 4 6 7 21 24 32  
 The majority of injuries were incurred during competition and one quarter during training which is in agreement with a study on injuries during 2007 World Athl etics Championships using the 
same injury surveillance system.
24 Injuries in training and in competition differed significantly in 
all injury characteristics and with  regard to the different sports. In general, contact with another 
athlete was the most frequent cause of injury, followed by non-contact trauma and overuse. Other 
potential causes of injury such as equipment failure, field and weather conditions were rare. 
However, the causes of injury differed substa ntially between the spor ts, and thus injury 
prevention programmes should be tailor-made to th e injury profile of the respective sport. 
 
Injuries were reported from all sports with the highest injury risk in football, taekwondo, field 
hockey, handball, weightlifting, boxing, triathlon, and athletics. Laskowski et al29 found the 
highest percentage of injured athletes in judo, power lifting, and track an d field; Cunningham and 
Cunningham30 in hockey, taekwondo, and football. Greene and Bernhardt31 observed the highest 
injury rates in basketball, cycling, wrestl ing, roller hockey and football. Martin et al28 reported 
the most encounters for field hocke y and football players. Although th ere is a certain variation, it 
can be concluded that teams sports (such as football, handball, basketball and hockey) and 
martial sports (especially taekwondo and wrestli ng) have a relatively high injury risk. On the 
other hand, the lowest injury risk during th e Beijing Olympics was observed for sailing, 
canoe/kayak, rowing, synchronised swimming, diving, fencing and swimming which is also in 
agreement with the literature.28 29 30 31 
 
Limitations of the study and future research  
The injury definition and methods applied have been discussed in detail in another publication.33 
However, some limitations of the present study  should be mentioned. Time-loss for sport was 
based on the physician´s estimate of the number of days that the athlete will not be able to 
undertake their normal training pr ogramme or will not be able to compete. A follow-up of the 
injured athletes could improve the validity of this data,33 but was impractical because small 
NOCs have no associated medical personnel. The causes of injury were  described in given 
categories, and a more sophisticat e analysis of injury mechanisms might provide more detailed 
information for the development of preventive programmes.36 For example, incidences of contact 
injuries should be studied with respect to the ade quacy of rules to protect the athletes from injury 
and potential rule violation;37 38 motion analysis might help to understanding of the mechanisms 
of non-contact injuries.39 The present study focused exclusively on injuries incurred in training 
and competition. Future studies should also incl ude pre-existing (chronic) injuries and other 
medical conditions (such as illnesse s or disease) since they also can  significantly affect the health 
and performance of the athletes.   
C
ONCLUSION  
The injury surveillance system proved to be accept ed by all involved medical personnel and to be 
feasible in a large multi-sport event. The data in dicate that the injury su rveillance system covered 
almost all participating athletes. The consistent  findings with previous studies demonstrate the 
high quality of the data obtained. About 10% of the athletes incu rred an injury during the 2008 
Beijing Olympic Games, half of them a time-loss in jury. The diagnoses, causes and risk of injury 
differed substantially between the sports. Ther efore, injury prevention programmes should be 
tailor-made to the injury profile of the respectiv e sport. In future Olympic Games, the injury 
surveillance should be continued and, if possible,  extended with respect to follow-up of severe 
injuries, more sophisticated analys is of injury mechanisms, and th e inclusion of chronic injuries 
and sport-related illnesses.
