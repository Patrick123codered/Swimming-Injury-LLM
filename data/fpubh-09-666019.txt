and swimming instructors (SI). An online survey addressing occupational disorders was
conducted among 435 instructors (256 FI and 179 SI). In one su bgroup (57 FI and 42
SI), cardiorespiratory ﬁtness levels were evaluated using maximal oxygen consumption
(˙VO2max) as an indicator. Daily workload was assessed by monitoring the heart rate and
perception of exertion (using the Borg scale). Of the two gro ups, FI exhibited a higher

both FI and SI. Regarding the daily workload, female SI had si gniﬁcantly higher mean
heart rate and mean heart rate to maximal heart rate ratio com pared to female FI, but
no signiﬁcant differences between male FI and SI were found. No signiﬁcant differences
were observed between the perceivedexertion of FI and SI. Pr eventive strategies for the

INTRODUCTION
The ﬁtness industry is booming: the last 10 years have shown a rapid increase in the number of
ﬁtness club members and employees, with almost 750,000 ﬁtnes s employees in Europe alone ( 1).
In particular, the ﬁtness industry includes both ﬁtness and/ or swimming pool centers. In ﬁtness

Merati et al. Occupational Disorders in Sport Instructors
FI work with individual clients to design, explain, and
demonstrate various exercises and routines, or they teach g roup
classes where they organize and lead ﬁtness lessons lasting 30–
90min. In these classes, instructors may set the music and
choreography to exercise sequences, while often also using
speciﬁc exercise equipment (e.g., stationary bicycles, weig hts,
etc.). SI generally help people learn how to swim, improve
swimming skills, and exercise in water. Moreover, they are
also specialized in teaching water aerobics classes during w hich
they perform aerobic exercises along with the water-immerse d
participants. These classes focus on aerobic endurance, crea ting
anenjoyableatmospherewithmusic.
Both FI and SI professions are physically demanding. Most
of the time, FI and SI ﬁnd themselves having to carry out
the exercises themselves while teaching, and they may work
nights, weekends, holidays, and may even have to travel to
diﬀerentgymsortoclients’homestoteachclassesortocondu ct
personal training sessions. However, despite the numerous
health-related advantages of physical activity and exercis e, the
risk of occupational disorders among FI and SI has been poorly
addressed by academic research. To date, a high prevalence
of musculoskeletal injuries in FI has been described ( 2–7):
most of the injuries were to lower arms and lower back
(12.9%), and they were associated with the number of times per
week the instructors exercised. No clear relationship betw een
musculoskeletal disorders and sex has been uncovered thus
far(7).
Inadditiontooverallstressonthemusculoskeletalsystem, FI
and SI actively have to make use of their voices during classe s
and rely on their voices in a similar way that vocal performers ,
classroomteachers,salespeople,andothersinvocallydeman ding
professions do ( 8). FI and SI have reported voice diﬃculties
that appear to be the result of an interaction between both
environmentalandphysiologicalstressplacedonthevoicegi ven
thatspeaking/shoutingandvigorousexerciseoftenhavetoo ccur
simultaneously during classes ( 9–11). Indeed, for FI and SI the
voice is an essential professional asset used not only to provi de
education and direction but also to motivate and encourage
class participants to persevere ( 12). The vocal eﬀectiveness of
the instructor has a direct inﬂuence on the satisfaction of c lients
and keeps them motivated to return. Furthermore, the amount
and type of verbal motivation required are often driven by the
ﬁtness genre ( 8). There are also several factors that can add
additional vocal strain, because instructors often vocali ze with
musicandothernoisesourcesinthebackgroundandoftentea ch
in acoustically poor spaces ( 12). As such, several papers found
thatﬁtnessinstructorsexperiencedmorehoarsenessandepis odes
of voice loss during and after instructing and had a signiﬁca ntly
higher prevalence of laryngeal nodules ( 8,9,12). Finally, gender
was shown to impact the occurrence of vocal disorders with
femalesbeingmostcommonlyaﬀected( 13).
Since studies on the occupational disorders experienced by
FI and SI are limited, the primary purpose of this study was
to investigate the 2-year prevalence of occupational disorde rs
experienced by FI and SI employed in various ﬁtness center
companies through a self-reported questionnaire. In additio n,
we assessed the ﬁtness levels, workloads, and perceived exer tionduring a typical workday of SI and FI in order to explore the
possible factors associated with occupational disorders in the se
occupations. In particular, the possible eﬀects of sex, instruc tor
type,andyearsofworkexperienceontheobservedoccupational
disorderswereconsidered.
METHODS
Study Design
Inordertoassessthe2-yearprevalenceofoccupationaldisord ers
experienced by FI and SI, a retrospective, cross-sectional, se lf-
reporting study was conducted. Subsequently, to investigat e
physical ﬁtness and daily workload during a typical workday of
FIandSI,aprospective,cross-sectional,substudywasperfor med.
The outcome of the study was the prevalence of occupational
disorders among FI and SI. We calculated a sample size taking
the expected proportion of cases from previous literature data
on musculoskeletal ( 7) and vocal disorders ( 8–11,13) among
FI. The calculation led to a corresponding number of 270 and
354 individuals, respectively (which included a predicted 20%
rejection rate), which was needed to estimate the prevalence of
musculoskeletalandvocaldisorders.
Participant Screening
Participantswererecruitedfromvariousﬁtnesscentersloc atedin
the North of Italy. These centers employed both FI (e.g., danc e
aerobics, step aerobics, spinning, pilates, yoga, low-back pa in
exercise classes, strength training, boxing/kickboxing) and SI
(e.g.,wateraerobics,swimmingcourses,mother/babyswim ming
courses).Thequestionnaireswerecollectedfrom2008to20 10by
activatingthecommunicationchannelsofthesportscenters and
getting University students of the Faculty of Exercise Scienc es in
Milan to directly contact their colleagues at the sports cente rs
where they attended classes. The inclusion criteria were be ing
an FI or SI instructor and teaching a minimum of one class
a week. The exclusion criterion was being unable to ﬁll out
the questionnaire, of which the English translation can be
found in the SupplementaryMaterial . Potential participants’
e-mail addresses were provided by the head of each center.
The responders were contacted by email where they were fully
informedaboutthestudy’sproceduresandthebeneﬁtsandris ks
associated with participation. A consent form was sent to the
participant viae-mail which then had to be signed and e-mailed
back by the participant. At this point, the online survey was
e-mailed to the participant who had agreed to participate and
met the above inclusion criteria. Participants who agreed to also
participate in the next part of the study (i.e., the physical ﬁtnes s
assessment) were contacted by phone to organize the laborato ry
testinganddailyworkloadmonitoring.
The Online Survey
The online survey was created according to the guidelines
provided by Artino et al. ( 14). Subjects were requested to
complete the survey within a 2-week period. The data retrieved
from the online questionnaires was subsequently entered in a
protected database, from which the data was reorganized in
tabular form for the purpose of descriptive statistics. The surv ey

requested information regarding personal physical data as we ll
as the frequency, duration, and time period (early morning,
morning, afternoon, or evening) of class participation. For t he
purposes of this study, all self-reported occupational disorde rs
related to their work during the last 2 years were asked by
having the participant answer the following question: “Have y ou
experienced any occupational disorder as a FI or SI during the
last 2 years?” ( 7). In the case of a positive response, participants
had to specify each injury and the type of injury (acute/overus e)
in accordance with the deﬁnitions provided by a consensus
statement regarding disorder registration ( 15). A “disorder” was
deﬁned as any condition causing pain and/or limiting activit y.
Only those participants who saw a physician for their disorders
were asked to report a diagnosis. Participants who did not see a
physician were asked to report the location of the disorder. Th e
extent of the disorder was examined by contingency question sregardingthelimitation(s)thattheinjuryplacedonactivi ty.The
surveytook20–25mintoﬁllout.
Physical Fitness Assessment
Participants’ physical ﬁtness was assessed using maximal oxyg en
consumption assessment ( ˙VO2max) in the laboratory of the
UniversityofMilanuponindividualappointment.
Thecardiopulmonaryexercisetestingwasperformedafterthe
physical assessment session during work in order to avoid the
possible carryover eﬀect of fatigue on the subsequent working
days. Oxygen consumption ( ˙VO2), carbon dioxide production

constant ambient conditions (i.e., a temperature of 22 ±2◦C
and humidity of <70%). The protocol consisted of 3min at 50
W/min (warm-up and familiarization), followed by an increas e
of 20W every min until exhaustion. Achievement of ˙VO2max
was considered as the attainment of at least two of the followi ng
criteria: (1) a plateau of ˙VO2levels despite increasing speed; (2)
a respiratory exchange ratio above 1.1; and (3) a heart rate (H R)
of±10 bpm of age-predicted maximal HR (i.e., 220 −age) (16).
HR was recorded during the entire test using an HR monitor
(Polar RS800, Polar Electro, Kempele, Finland). Maximal HR at
exhaustionwasconsideredasHR max.
Daily Workload Monitoring
Each participant was equipped with the HR monitor and
instructed to wear it during their typical workday for 1 week.

their normal daily working routine and to maintain their usu al

The Borg CR100 scale ( 18) was selected to rate the perceived
exertion of a typical lesson. A verbal-anchored scale was
provided to the participants who were instructed to use it
30min after the end of their workday. Each participant was
preliminary familiarized with the Borg CR100 scale, including
anchoringprocedures.
Statistical Analysis
Respondents with missing data were excluded from the analysis.
Descriptive statistics (mean ±standard deviation) for the
outcome measures were calculated. The normality of the
distribution was checked using the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test .
Since all anthropometric variables were normally distribute d,
diﬀerences between male and female FI and SI were checked
using an unpaired Student’s t-test. A Chi-square test was used
to compare the questionnaire’s variables of educational lev el,
professionalinformation,andjobcharacteristicsbetween FIand
SI groups. Diﬀerences between the perceived exertion after the
maximally fatiguing workday and the perceived exertion 30min
after the end of the lessons of FI and SI were studied using the
Student’s paired t-test. Intra- and intergroup diﬀerences (gender

RESULTS
Participant Screening Results
The study population included 472 participants of which 435
instructors completed the online survey, (response rate: 92.2 %).
Ninety-nine subjects (57 FI and 42 SI) agreed to also participat e
in the next phase of the study during which their ﬁtness
level, workload monitoring, and perceived exertion of a typica l
workday were measured. The design of the study is shown
inFigure1.
Online Survey Results
Table1shows the demographics of the participants. The
participants in each group were similar in age, height, body
mass, and body mass index (BMI). Only a small percentage of
the participants had been active in their profession >10 years.
The number of weekly work hours was <10h for more than
half of all FI and between 10 and 30h per week for all SI. The
presence of preexisting pathologies was not investigated in th is
study. Most of the participants ( ∼70%) stated that they partake
in both competitive and/or noncompetitive sports outside of
their profession for an average of 5.4 ±4.2h per week. In Italy,

Overall, a total of 621 musculoskeletal disorders and 521
other types of disorders were reported in the study of 157
FI (61% of 256 FI who completed the survey) and 155 SI
(86% of 179 SI who completed the survey), that experienced
two or more injuries during the last 2 years. Figure2
illustrates the 2-year prevalence of occupational disorders that
occurred in the FI and SI careers, divided into musculoskelet al
and other disorders. The percentages of ankle, knee, and
wrist sprains, shoulder dislocations, contusions, muscle pu lls
and contractures, lower back pain, and articular pain were
signiﬁcantly higher in the FI group vs. the SI group ( p
=0.032). Non-musculoskeletal diseases such as bronchitis,
sore throat/aphonia, and headache were signiﬁcantly more
common in the FI group ( p=0.014), whereas warts and
upper respiratory tract infections were more frequent in the SI
group(p=0.025).

Rating of Perceived Exertion Results
The perceived level of exertion after a typical workday was 72. 3
±16.2AU (i.e., arbitrary units in the CR100 scale, a point
scale up to 100 with 100 being the maximum possible level of
exertion)( 18)inFIand72.0 ±18.0AUinSI,withnosigniﬁcant
diﬀerences between the groups. Figure3 shows the perceived
physical exertion of a typical lesson conducted by FI and SI.
About 50% of the SI group and 60% of the FI group reported
feeling that their typical lesson was physically “hard,” with no
signiﬁcant diﬀerences between groups. A signiﬁcantly higherpercentage of SI participants described the physical exertion of
their lesson as “very hard” ( p=0.042 between groups, χ2test
forpercentages).
DISCUSSION
To the best of our knowledge, the present study is one of the
ﬁrst that investigated the prevalence of occupational disorde rs
among FI andSI. Inparticular, we observed thatFI hada higher
2-year prevalence of musculoskeletal occupational disorders,
whereas SI experienced more acute and chronic voice disorders .
Moreover, since FI and SI have to cope with physical exertion
andpsychologicalstress,wehaveprovidedobjectivedataont heir
physicalﬁtnesslevelandworkloadduringatypicalworkday.
Regardingmusculoskeletaldisorders,weobservedthatmuscle
tightness (i.e., a shortening of a muscle), ankle, knee, and w rist
sprains, shoulder dislocations, contusions, low-back pain, and
articular pain were very common among FI. Our results are
in line with previous ﬁndings on FI occupational health ( 3–
5,7,19). Hickey and Hager ( 19) showed that the most common
chronic injuries in aerobic dance instructors were tendini tis,
repetitivestraininjury,patello-femoraldiseases,andmedi altibial
syndromes, followed by ankle sprain and low-back pain, as
suggested by Rothenberger et al. ( 3). Also, du Toit et al. ( 4) and
Bratland-Sanda et al. ( 7) reported that the lower-limb injuries
were very common, with the ankle (32.8%) and the knee (20%)
being the most common sites of injury. Generally, these types o f
injuriesareclassiﬁedasoveruseinjuries,resultingfromr epetitive
force applied to a tissue, joint, or ligament. Bratland-Sanda
(7) stated that the greater risk of lower-limb musculoskeletal
disorders in FI is related to the monotonous exercise modalit y,
which is a primary risk factor for overuse injuries. In additio n,
Sohl and Bowling ( 17) reported high-intensity training classes,
unsuitable ﬂoors, shoe type, high number of workouts per day,
diﬃcult choreography, and insuﬃcient warm-up as the factors
that may contribute to more occupational disorders of the lowe r
limbs. Finally, Scharﬀ-Olson ( 20) indicated that the number
of weekly classes was an additional variable associated wit h
musculoskeletaldisorders.Infact,fouraerobicdancesess ionsper
week increasedthe injury incidence from 43% to 66% compared
to subjects who exercised three times per week or less ( 20).
On the contrary, we found that SI had a lower prevalence of
musculoskeletaloccupationaldisorders.Thiswasnotunexpect ed
seeing as SI work is largely done standing (e.g., classic swim
classes) or is anti-gravitational (e.g., during water imme rsed
aerobicclasses).
With regard to the other disorders, the present investigation
found that both FI and SI are at a higher risk of developing
both acute and chronic voice diﬃculties associated with the
development of sore throat, aphonia, and bronchitis. These
results corroborate previous research that found that 58
and 12% of group ﬁtness instructors experience hoarseness
and voice loss immediately following classes ( 20). It seems
reasonable to associate these disorders with the typical
demands of the job that require loud verbal instructions
while performing exercises, thereby making the control of

breathing and airﬂow movement more stressful. Indeed, it
has been demonstrated that the interaction between both
environmental and physiological stress leads FI and SI to
assume a hyperfunctional behavior that could also be worsene d
by postural misalignment, breathing patterns, and work
environmentandthereforeleadtotheadoptionofcompensator y
vocal behaviors ( 21). This has been observed especially in
young and inexperienced instructors who risk developing
voice overuse and laryngeal diseases in the long run ( 22).
Another incidental factor may be the poor air quality (e.g.,
dryness, dust) in the workplace that may cause allergic react ions
or sinus infections ( 23). Finally, the use of chlorine-based
products to sanitize swimming water in daily life may aﬀect
the respiratory health of SI ( 24). Moreover, we observed
that SI are at a higher risk to develop headache and warts
compared to FI. Regarding headaches, we hypothesize that the
warm temperatures and humidity typical of swimming pool
environments may play a role, especially in individuals prone
to migraine attacks ( 25). Regarding warts, it is well known that
swimmingpoolsmaybeamorefavorableenvironmentforthese
typesofinfections( 26).
Regarding the ﬁtness level assessment, we are now able to
provide evidence of the physicalﬁtness anddaily workload of FI
and SI. In particular, we found that FI and SI showed the same
˙VO2maxduring a graded maximal test and HR during a typical
workday. Therefore, the aerobic ﬁtness level was comparable
between FI and SI subjects, suggesting that both groups are
probably exposed to a similar workload, and thus training,during a workday. Our results are similar to those found in
the study of Wanke et al. ( 27), who assessed the work-related
cardiovascular loads in professional dance teachers. They f ound
that, depending on the dance style (e.g., jazz, modern dance,
ballet, etc.), the average HR load during the lessons ranged
between 56.7 and 63.6% of the individual HR max. Interestingly,
we found a signiﬁcantly higher HR meanin women during a
typical workday in SI with respect to FI. We could therefore
speculate that female SI are more often involved in aqua gym
classes or similar training sessions, which require active physical
participationfromtheinstructor,whereasmaleSIaremoreli kely
to be devoted to swimming instruction or training, which doe s
notincludeactivephysicalinvolvement.
This study had some limitations. Firstly, the questionnair e
we used was custom-made and has not yet been validated
nor checked for internal consistency. After its design, the
questionnaire was only submitted to a small group of ﬁtness
experts,whoevaluatedwhetherthequestionseﬀectivelycaptu red
the topic under investigation. The data obtained with this
questionnaireshouldthereforebeconsideredaspilotdata.
Secondly, due to the paucity of research in this area, the
ﬁrst part of this study was designed as a cross-sectional and
exploratory study. Although this design is less expensive and
can be performed within a shorter period of time, some
confounding factors such as history of injuries and work
habits prior to data collections cannot be controlled. There fore,
antecedent–consequent relationships as well as occupational
disorders and relative risk cannot be established through
Frontiers in Public Health | www.frontiersin.org 7 June 2021 | Volume 9 | Article 666019
Merati et al. Occupational Disorders in Sport Instructors
this design. Thirdly, it was not possible to perform analysis
of diﬀerences between respondents and nonrespondents. A
possible selection bias is that the prevalence of injuries and
musculoskeletal pain might have been higher among the
respondents compared to the nonrespondents, thus aﬀecting
the results and the external validity of the study. Finally, the
self-reporting of injuries and musculoskeletal pain is also a
limitation, since this method makes it impossible to verify th e
injurylocationandtypebyathirdparty.However,theassessm ent
of physical ﬁtness of FI and SI as well as daily workload and
theirperceivedexertionarevaluableinformationtofocuso nand
when designing future studies. We therefore suggest that fu ture
research considers these factors to conduct more meaningfu l

CONCLUSION
In conclusion, a high 2-year prevalence of instruction-relat ed

be considered as an occupational hazard. Guidelines on the
maximum weekly instruction load are therefore recommended
