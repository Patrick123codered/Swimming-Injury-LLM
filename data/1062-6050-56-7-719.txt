Context: The National Collegiate Athletic Association
(NCAA) has sponsored men’s swimming and diving since 1937.
Background: Routine examinations of men’s swimming
and diving injuries are important for identifying emerging
injury-related patterns.
Methods: Exposure and injury data collected in the NCAA
Injury Surveillance Program during the 2014–2015 through2018–2019 academic years were analyzed. Injury counts, rates,
and proportions were used to describe injury characteristics, and
injury rate ratios were used to examine differences in injury rates.
Results: The overall injury rate was 1.56 per 1000 athlete-
exposures (AEs) for swimmers and 1.52 per 1000 AEs for divers.Shoulder (27.0%) injuries accounted for the largest proportion of
all swimming injuries, and most injuries were attributed to overusemechanisms (42.6%). Shoulder (23.3%) and trunk (23.3%)injuries accounted for the largest proportion of all diving injuries,and most injuries resulted from surface contact (32.6%).
Conclusions: Findings were consistent with existing litera-
ture on swimming and diving. The need for continuedsurveillance, coupled with more robust participation by swim-ming and diving programs was also highlighted.
Key Words: collegiate, sport-related, surveillance
Key Points
/C15Overall, competition and practice injury rates were similar in men’s swimming.
/C15The most common speciﬁc injuries in men’s swimming were biceps tendinitis, shoulder impingement, rotator cuff
tear (partial or complete), and rotator cuff tendinitis.
/C15In both men’s swimming and men’s diving, most injuries were attributed to the shoulder or trunk and were classiﬁedas non-time loss injuries.
The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA)
has sponsored men’s swimming and diving since1937.
1In recent years, participation has continued to
grow, with an estimated 444 sponsored teams and 9800
athletes competing2in 2018–2019. Despite the large number
of NCAA student athletes and steady increases in member-ship over the years, few studies have explored the
epidemiology of collegiate swimming- and diving-related
injuries.
3,4An updated investigation is needed to appraise the
overall health and safety of this population and to assess
temporal patterns in injury incidence within this group.
The NCAA initiated an injury surveillance system to
monitor injuries within collegiate athletics5,6in 1982. After
its evolution to an electronic platform, this system iscurrently known as the NCAA Injury Surveillance Program
(ISP). The NCAA ISP has collected data on men’s
swimming and diving
4since 2009–2010. The most recent
study using these data identiﬁed similar injury rates betweenmen’s swimming and men’s diving.4The overall injury rate
in men’s swimming was approximately 1.5 injuries per 1000
athlete-exposures (AEs); and in men’s diving, approximately2 injuries per 1000 AEs.
4It was also reported that most
injuries in swimmers and divers were shoulder related andthat injuries were most commonly classiﬁed as overuse andnoncontact mechanisms.

Routine examination of injury incidence in this population
is necessary to highlight areas that may warrant furtherattention and to inform the implementation of targetedinterventions aimed at injury prevention. As such, the purposeof this study was to describe the epidemiology of sport-relatedinjuries among men’s swimming and diving student-athletes

2018–2019 athletic seasons were analyzed in this study.
The methods of the NCAA ISP have been reviewed andapproved as an exempt study by the NCAA Research
Review Board. In brief, athletic trainers (ATs) at partici-
pating institutions contributed exposure and injury data
using their clinical electronic medical record systems. A
reportable injury was one that occurred due to participationin an organized intercollegiate practice or competition and
required medical attention by a team AT or physician,
regardless of time lost. Scheduled team practices andcompetitions were considered reportable exposures for this
analysis. Data from 7 (2% of membership) participating
programs in 2014–2015, from 4 (1% of membership) in
2015–2016, from 8 (2% of membership) in 2016–2017,
from 8 (2% of membership) in 2017–2018, and from 23(5% of membership) in 2018–2019 qualiﬁed for inclusion
in analyses. Qualiﬁcation criteria are detailed further in the
methods article within this special issue.

Classifying Injuries and Athlete-Exposures by
Swimming Versus Diving
Injured athletes were identiﬁed as either swimmers or
divers when injury records were submitted by the AT. Forinjury records with unknown athlete type, it was assumed
that the athlete was a swimmer if the corresponding activity
at the time of injury was reported as backstroke,
breaststroke, butterﬂy, freestyle, or medley. The athlete
was assumed to be a diver if the corresponding activity wasreported as 1.0-m board, 1.0-m platform, 3.0-m board, 3.0-
m platform, 5.0-m platform, 7.5-m platform, or 10.0-m
platform. Injury records without an identiﬁable athlete typewere not retained in the analysis (n ¼11). Combined AEs
were collected for swimming and diving teams in the
NCAA ISP. Previous researchers studying this population
determined that on average, 87% of athletes on swimming
and diving team rosters were swimmers, whereas 13% weredivers.
4Injury rates for swimming and diving were
calculated separately according to their respective distribu-
tion of AEs.Statistical Analysis
Injury counts and rates per 1000 AEs for each athlete
type (swimmers, divers) were examined by event type
(practice, competition) and time lost (time loss [TL], non–time loss [NTL]). Poststratiﬁcation sample weights bysport, year, and division are established within thesurveillance system to compute national estimates of injuryevents on the basis of the sampled teams. An AE wasdeﬁned as 1 athlete participating in 1 exposure event.Weighted and unweighted rates were estimated; however,results have been presented in terms of unweighted rates(unless otherwise speciﬁed) due to low frequencies of
injury observations across levels of certain explanatory
variables. Temporal trends in injury rates (pooled forpractices and competitions) across the study period wereevaluated using rate proﬁle plots stratiﬁed by athlete type.Injury counts and proportions were examined by body partinjured, mechanism of injury, injury diagnosis, and activityat the time of injury. Respiratory infections (n ¼40) were
not included in analyses due to reporting inconsistencies(by program and year) across the study period. Injury rateratios were used to examine differential injury rates across
event types. The injury rate ratios with associated 95%
conﬁdence intervals (CIs) excluding 1.00 were consideredstatistically signiﬁcant. All analyses were conducted usingSAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute).
RESULTS
A total of 339 men’s swimming and diving injuries
(swimmers: 296; divers: 43) from 218 050 AEs (swimmers:189 704; divers: 28 346) were reported to the NCAA ISP
during the 2014–2015 through 2018–2019 athletic seasons
(rate: swimmers ¼1.56/1000 AEs; divers ¼1.52/1000
AEs). This equated to a national estimate of 13 521 injuriesoverall (swimmers: 10 956; divers: 2 565; Table 1). Acrossthe study period overall, there were no signiﬁcantdifferences in swimming injury rates by event type(practice, competition). Differences in diving injury ratesby event type were not examined due to a low number ofTable 1.

competition-related injuries (n ,10) reported across the
study period. In swimmers, injury rates remained relativelystable between 2014–2015 and 2016–2017, then increasedsharply during 2017–2018 before falling again in 2018–
2019 (Figure A). The diving injury rates appeared to
decrease across the study period (Figure A). However,injury rates for divers in 2015–2016 and 2016–2017 werepotentially unstable due to low numbers of reported injuriesduring these years (n ,5). Accordingly, estimated injury
rates corresponding to these years are illustrated in Figure
A as open circles and connected to other annual estimateswith a dotted line, and these estimates should be interpretedwith caution.
Time Loss
In both men’s swimming and diving, NTL injuries
represented a larger proportion of all reported injuries thanTL injuries (swimmers: NTL: 51.3%, TL: 35.5%, missing:
13.2%; divers: NTL: 51.2%, TL: 32.5%, missing: 16.3%).
In men’s swimming, TL injuries accounted for 34.3% ofreported practice injuries and 50.0% of competitioninjuries; whereas in men’s diving, TL injuries accountedfor 35.3% of reported practice injuries and 22.2% of
competition injuries. Overall TL injury rates for swimmers
remained relatively stable between 2014–2015 and 2016–2017, then increased sharply in 2017–2018, followed by adecrease in 2018–2019 (Figure B).
Injury Characteristics
Injuries to the shoulder (27.0%) and trunk (16.2%)
accounted for the largest proportions of all men’sswimming injuries reported during the study period (Table
2). Among shoulder injuries, nearly half (47.5%) were
NTL, approximately a third (30.0%) were TL, and roughlya quarter (22.5%) had missing TL data. Similarly, a greaterproportion of trunk injuries involved NTL (NTL: 50.0%;TL: 33.3%; missing TL data: 16.7%). The most commonly
reported mechanisms of injury were overuse (42.6%) and
noncontact (18.9%) injuries. Overuse injuries accounted fora larger proportion of practice injuries (43.4%) thancompetition injuries (31.8%), whereas noncontact injuriesaccounted for a larger proportion of competition injuries
(27.3%) than practice injuries (18.3%). Most men’sswimming injuries reported during 2014–2015 through2018–2019 were strains (19.6%) and inﬂammatory condi-
tions (18.6%). Strains were more prevalent among reported
competition injuries (36.4%) than practice injuries (18.3%),whereas inﬂammatory conditions were more prevalentamong reported practice injuries (19.0%) than competitioninjuries (13.6%). The most commonly reported speciﬁc
injuries during the study period were biceps tendinitis
(shoulder) (7.8%; Rate ¼1.21 per 10000 AEs), shoulder
impingement (4.7%; Rate ¼0.74 per 10000 AEs), rotator
cuff tear (partial or complete) (3.4%; Rate ¼0.53 per 10000
AEs), and rotator cuff tendinitis (3.4%; Rate ¼0.53 per
10000 AEs).
Injuries to the shoulder (23.3%) and trunk (23.3%)
accounted for the largest proportions of all men’s divinginjuries reported during the study period (Table 3). Injurieswere most commonly attributed to surface contact (32.6%),
noncontact (30.2%), and overuse (20.9%) mechanisms.
Most men’s diving injuries reported during the study periodwere strains (18.6%) and inﬂammatory conditions (16.3%);no speciﬁc injury was observed to be notably prevalentamong all reported diving injuries.
Injuries by Swimming- and Diving-Specific Activities
Most injuries in men’s swimming between 2014–2015
and 2018–2019 occurred during freestyle swim (34.1%),
conditioning (16.9%), and breaststroke swim (10.8%).
Injuries occurring during freestyle and breaststroke eventswere more prevalent among reported competition injuriesthan practice injuries (Table 4). Most injuries in men’sdivers during the study period occurred during unspeciﬁed
diving activities (44.2%).
SUMMARY
This study aimed to describe the epidemiology of NCAA
men’s swimming- and diving-related injuries reported to
the NCAA ISP between the 2014–2015 and 2018–2019academic years. Injury rates in men’s swimming remainedrelatively stable and low during the ﬁrst 3 years of the study

period before ﬂuctuating during the ﬁnal years of the study.
The observed ﬂuctuations in the ﬁnal 2 years of the study
may be reﬂective of variation in AT documentation
practices.8The relatively low number of participating
schools during the 2017–2018 academic year may predis-
pose overall trends to vary more dramatically in reaction to
small differences in AT reporting practices. Furthermore, itis salient to note that during the ﬁnal year of the study
period, participation increased almost 3-fold, due largely to
revised recruitment strategies (for instance, support and
communication from the NCAA Sport Science Institute). It
is reasonable to suggest that the estimates associated with2018–2019 may be a more appropriate representation of the
injury burden in this population than estimates from
previous years. The overall men’s swimming injury rateobserved in this study was comparable to previous reports
of this population.
4However, the competition injury rate in
men’s swimming was notably lower in the present studythan in previous reports.4Despite the relative stability, the
changes observed among competition injuries as well as the
observed ﬂuctuations in the ﬁnal years of the study may
also be reﬂective of changes in training patterns. High
intensity interval training (HIIT), which generally refers to
repeated short to long bouts of high-intensity exercise
interspersed with recovery periods,9had become a popular
style of training among strength coaches in the previous 5
years.10HIIT has been studied in several populations and
found to be a highly effective training technique in
endurance sports.11,12In sprint-distance triathlon partici-
pants, HIIT has been shown to both increase muscularperformance and improve athletic performance in swim,
cycling, and running time.
9Although outside the scope of
information collected by the NCAA ISP, changes in overalltraining techniques (such as a transition from long periods
of low-speed swimming to a HIIT approach) may be an
important area of future study in traditional enduranceTable 2. Distribution of Swimmer Injuries by Body Part, Mechanism, and Injury Diagnosis; Stratified by Event Typea

sports such as swimming. There were insufﬁcient data to
examine temporal patterns in competition injury incidence
among swimmers in the present study. However, future
researchers may examine more closely the trajectories of
competition injury incidence in this population to determine
whether the pattern is maintained and to identify temporal
nuances. Such examinations will be critical in identifying
rules and policy changes that have been effective in
reducing the injury burden among NCAA men’s swimming
athletes.
The NTL injuries accounted for over half of all reported
swimming injuries across the study period.13This may be
unsurprising given the prevalence of overuse injuries,
which often do not initially require missed participation.14
The prevalence of NTL shoulder injuries in swimming maybe of particular concern. In a previous study of actively
competing competitive swimmers, 91% reported a history
of shoulder pain and 80% reported pain during activity on a
constant, daily, weekly, or monthly basis.
15Given the
observed prevalence of shoulder pain among actively
training swimmers, the incidence of shoulder injury mayeven be greater than that observed in the present study.
Because overuse injuries are often chronic and may beassociated with cycles of remission and exacerbation,
documenting only the cases that required medical attention
and intervention by an AT may not fully capture the
prevalence of shoulder pain in this population. When
addressing overuse and chronic pain, clinicians andresearchers alike may seek to identify cases of chronic
shoulder pain as opposed to acute injury presentations.
16
Similarly, the observed distribution of swimming injuries
across body parts may be expected when considering the
dynamics of the sport. Given that swimmers use their upper
extremities to propel themselves through the water, it is not
surprising that injuries were mostly attributed to the
shoulder, trunk, and hip and groin, as opposed to theextremities (eg, hand and wrist, elbow, foot, ankle, knee).
Notably, most swimming injuries were attributed to
noncontact or overuse mechanisms. These types ofmechanisms have been known to lead to the development
of inﬂammatory conditions such as bicep tendonitis, rotator
cuff tendonitis, or bursitis.

competitive swimming and the typical nature of injuries
reported in men’s swimming, it is unsurprising that the 3most reported speciﬁc injuries were in fact biceps tendonitis(shoulder), shoulder impingement, and rotator cuff tendi-nitis.
17,18It is important to note that swimming athletes may
also experience concomitant shoulder injuries due to themultifactorial etiology (strength imbalances, glenohumeraljoint laxity, scapular dyskinesia) of overuse shoulder
pain.
18–20On the basis of the existing literature surrounding
the prevalence of shoulder injury,13the necessary stress and
strain on the shoulder to be competitive—and the difﬁcultyin implementing injury prevention programs for a multi-factorial injury that is often overuse—may involve multipleanatomical structures and involve individualized muscularimbalances and form variations. It may be reasonable tosuggest that in addition to screening for risk factors such asrange of motion deﬁcits, muscular imbalances, and historyof injury, clinician and research focus should be aimed
towards secondary injury prevention strategies. This may
include monitoring fatigue and recovery as well asaddressing the cycle of remission and exacerbation withinoveruse injuries. Previous studies have indicated that arepetitive strain on the shoulder and a high prevalence ofshoulder injury are associated with competitive swim-ming.
15,21Coupled with the multifactorial pathology of
shoulder injury in swimming (which may involve multipleanatomical structures,
22muscular imbalances,23and form
variations24), it may be reasonable to suggest that in
addition to screening for risk factors (such as excessive and/
or limited range of motion,24,25muscular imbalances,23and
history of injury), clinicians and researchers should alsofocus on secondary injury prevention strategies. Suchstrategies may include monitoring workload
26,27as well
as addressing the cycle of remission and exacerbationwithin overuse injuries.
16Given that whole-body movement and coordination is
necessary in swimming, it is important to identify thatinjury to the shoulder may be a functional manifestation ofunderlying core weakness.
24,28–30This observation in
previous literature (in both swimming24,28and overhead31,32
athletes) may be further supported by the ﬁnding that afterthe shoulder, the trunk and the hip and groin were also
prevalently injured structures in the current study. There-
fore, the observed distribution of injuries along the kineticchain among NCAA men’s swimming athletes in thepresent study point to the importance of the interactionamong the shoulder, trunk, and hip and groin and mayindicate a relationship between the inherent risks of injurywithin these structures.
28,30,33
The overall men’s diving injury rate in the present study
was lower than previously reported in this population.4
Given the observed frequencies of diving injuries reportedacross the study period, it is difﬁcult to contextualize theseﬁndings. The most commonly reported injuries among
men’s diving occurred in the shoulder and trunk, which is
consistent with previous reports within this population.
4It
is important that the biomechanics of diving during takeoff(contact with the surface of the diving board or platform),ﬂight, and entry are inherent factors that contribute toinjury.
34During takeoff, ﬂight, and entry, divers perform
complex extension, ﬂexion, and rotational movementswithin the trunk.
34Just before entering the water, divers’
shoulders are uniquely abducted and ﬂexed in a vulnerable
position whereby glenohumeral joint stability may be
compromised.34During entry, divers’ shoulders (abducted
and ﬂexed) and wrists (dorsiﬂexed, pronated, and radiallydeviated) bear signiﬁcant gravitational force of impact,breaking the surface tension of the water while being placedin an unstable position.
34The competitive nature of the
sport demands that athletes consistently practice andTable 4. Distribution of Injuries by Injury Activity; Stratified by Athlete Type and Event Typea

develop complex aerial movements, putting them at risk of
developing both strains through noncontact mechanismsand inﬂammatory conditions through overuse mechanism.
35
It may be noted that over half of all reported injuries in thepresent study were attributed to these mechanisms.Therefore, the ﬁndings of the present study are largelyconsistent with expectations given the biomechanicaldemands of diving activities.
In considering the results of the present study, there exist
limitations applicable to both swimming and diving injuriesthat warrant targeted attention and discussion. First, NCAAISP participation among men’s swimming and divingprograms was notably low throughout the study period.Despite the similarity in participation with previous
surveillance-based investigations of NCAA men’s swim-
ming,
4the limited participation among NCAA men’s
swimming programs in the current study not only limitsthe analytical ﬂexibility of the data collected (as notedthroughout the present study), but also the external validityof the ﬁndings. Whereas sports injury surveillance is aneffective tool to examine temporal patterns in injuryincidence, healthy participation in surveillance programsis needed to facilitate such investigations. As such, it iscritical to continue efforts aimed at increasing ISPparticipation among men’s swimming and diving programs.Second, in considering the injury rates reported in thepresent study, it is imperative to acknowledge thatexposure-time ascertainment remains a challenge in sportsinjury surveillance, particularly for individualized sportswith nontraditional athletic seasons, such as swimming anddiving. Swimming and diving are unique sports, andtherefore, swimmers and divers are subjected to inherently
different degrees of injury risk. As one example, swimmers
perform repetitive movements at varying intensities,whereas divers are tasked with performing highly technicalaerial maneuvers at a comparatively lesser volume. Thesedifferences notwithstanding, swimming and diving aretypically recognized as 1 team within member institutions.As such, computation of position-speciﬁc at-risk exposuretime is particularly challenging, and although AEs may beestimated on the basis of roster sizes (as done herein), thispractice remains far from ideal. Incorporating wearablehealth instruments to capture athletes’ time spent practic-ing, distance and strokes swum, number and type of dives,or cardiovascular and muscular exertional indices maymore precisely describe and quantify at-risk exposure timein this population.
36,37The NCAA ISP in its current form is
not well positioned to accommodate such measures, andsuch nuanced measurement may require adaptations insports injury surveillance (separately capturing at-riskexposure time for swimmers and divers) or small-sample
studies.
Routine surveillance of collegiate men’s swimmers and
divers allows researchers to describe and highlight injurypatterns, which in turn are disseminated to provide thesports medicine community with current and practicalinformation. As discussed above, this critical process willbe more effective with more robust participation in sportsinjury surveillance programs. Our ﬁndings demonstrateunique injury characteristics in NCAA men’s swimmingand diving. The results observed in this study, coupled withthe inferential limitations discussed above, highlight theneed for further study of men’s swimming and divinginjuries yet also offer avenues for additional data collection
and targeted examination.
