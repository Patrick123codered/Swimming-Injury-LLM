Finnish summary 
Diss. 
 
In sports with different exercise-loading characteristics, acute and overuse injury 
profiles and gender differences in injuries were investigated. In addition, training-
related risk factors for overuse injuries in endurance athletes were studied. This 
twelve-month retrospective questionnaire study comprised Finnish elite cross-
country skiers (n=149), swimmers (n=154), long-distance runners (n=143) and soccer 
players (n=128) aged 15–35 years. Questionnaires were sent to the athletes in each 
sports at the end of the 2006 competition season. Athletes who ended their sports 
career because of injury were studied in more detail by means of a telephone 
interview (n=20) 7-11 months after the questionnaire. Over 70% of soccer players and 
one-third of endurance athletes had sustained at least one acute injury during the 
past twelve months. In soccer players and cross-country skiers the most common 
acute injury site was the ankle. In skiers, acute and overuse injuries occurred mainly 
in sports other than their own sports and the same was true for acute injuries in 
swimmers. However, overuse injuries in swimmers mainly originated from 
swimming, with the shoulder region as the most common anatomical site. Nearly 
every second athlete reported at least one overuse injury, with the highest injury 
frequency, most commonly in the foot, occurring among long-distance runners. 
Soccer players and runners reported absences of nearly two months on average from 
training and competitions owing to acute or overuse injury. Male athletes had higher 
prevalence of at least one acute injury, and among runners males had more 
commonly at least one overuse injury than females. Among endurance athletes, 
vigorous training, defined as more than 700 hours/year, and rest and recovery time 
of less than two days a week in the training season predisposed to overuse injury. 
Older athletes had higher risk for overuse injury, and especially tendon overuse 
injury. Female athletes (13%) ended their career more often because of injury than 
male athletes (5%). The most prevalent injury was in the knee, shoulder or ankle. 
Most sports career terminators (70%) reported injury-related mild or moderate 
permanent disability. In conclusion, type of loading was strongly associated with the 
anatomical location of an overuse injury. In cross-country skiing and swimming a 
significant proportion of acute injuries occurred in other than the athlete’s main 
sports. Vigorous athletic training without sufficient rest and recovery time may be a 
risk factor for an injury, especially an overuse injury. Severe injuries may terminate 
an athlete´s sports career and cause permanent disability.

Urheiluvammat suomalaisilla huipputason hiihtäjillä, uimareilla,

Väitöskirjatutkimuksen tavoitteena oli selvittää eri tavoin kuormittavien 
urheilulajien vammaprofiilia ja vammojen eroja sukupuolten välillä. Sen lisäksi 
tutkittiin harjoitteluun liittyviä rasitusvammojen riskitekijöitä kestävyysurheilijoilla. 
Suomalaiset 15-35 -vuotiaat mies- ja naishuippu-urheilijat osallistuivat 12 kuukauden 
retrospektiiviseen kyselytutkimukseen. Urheilijat olivat maastohiihtäjiä (n=149), 
uimareita (n=154), kestävyysjuoksijoita (n=143) ja jalkapalloilijoita (n=128). Kysely 
lähetettiin urheilijoille vuonna 2006 kilpailukauden jälkeen. Ne urheilijat, jotka 
ilmoittivat lopettaneensa kilpaurheilunsa urheiluvamman takia, haastateltiin 
puhelimitse 7-11 kuukautta postikyselyn jälkeen (n=20). Jalkapalloilijoista yli 70% ja 
kestävyysurheilijoista joka kolmannelle sattui vähintään yksi äkillinen vamma 
edellisen vuoden aikana. Jalkapalloilijoiden ja maastohiihtäjien yleisin äkillinen 
vamma kohdistui nilkkaan. Maastohiihtäjien ja uimareiden äkilliset vammat ja 
hiihtäjien rasitusvammat tapahtuivat pääosin muissa lajeissa kuin heidän omassaan. 
Uimareiden rasitusvammat olivat pääosin peräisin uinnista ja tyypillisesti vamma oli 
olkapään alueella. Lähes joka toisella kyselyyn vastanneista urheilijoista oli ollut 
vuoden aikana vähintään yksi rasitusvamma ja kestävyysjuoksijoilla niitä oli eniten. 
Juoksijoiden yleisin rasitusvamma oli jalkaterän alueella. Jalkapalloilijat ja juoksijat 
joutuivat olemaan pois harjoittelusta ja kilpailuista keskimäärin lähes kaksi 
kuukautta äkillisten vammojen tai rasitusvammojen takia. Naisurheilijoihin 
verrattuna miehillä oli useammin vähintään yksi äkillinen vamma. Vähintään yhden 
rasitusvamman esiintyminen oli miesjuoksijoilla yleisempää kuin naisjuoksijoilla. 
Runsas harjoittelu (yli 700 tuntia/vuosi) ja alle kahden päivän viikoittainen lepoaika 
harjoittelukaudella altisti kestävyysurheilijoita rasitusvammoille. Vanhemmilla 
kestävyysurheilijoilla oli suurempi riski saada erityisesti jänteen rasitusvamma. 
Naisista 13% ja miehistä 5% lopetti urheilu-uransa vamman takia. Näillä urheilijoilla 
vammat kohdistuivat yleisimmin polveen, olkaniveleen tai nilkkaan. Yli 70% 
vamman vuoksi urheilu-uransa lopettaneista urheilijoista raportoi vammasta 
aiheutuneen pientä tai kohtalaista pysyvää haittaa toimintakyvylle. Tämän 
tutkimuksen perusteella voidaan todeta, että kuormituksen laatu on suoraan 
yhteydessä rasitusvamman esiintymiselle. Hiihtäjien ja uimareiden äkillisistä 
vammoista suurin osa tapahtuu muussa kuin omassa lajissa. Etenkin 
kestävyysurheilijoilla runsas harjoittelu vähäisen palautumisen lisäksi altistaa 
rasitusvammoille. Urheilija voi joutua lopettamaan urheilu-uransa vakavan vamman 
vuoksi ja vamma voi aiheuttaa urheilijalle myös pysyvää haittaa.

1 INTRODUCTION 
 
 
Regular physical activity is essential for optimal body function and health. 
Physical activity is associated with reduced risk for premature morbidity and 
mortality (Kujala et al. 2003a, Kujala 2004, Nelson et al. 2007). In addition, exercise improves aerobic and functional capacity and muscle strength among healthy individuals and those with chronic disease (Schjerve et al. 2008, Kujala 
2009).  Moderate-intensity activity (150 minutes/week), vigorous physical 
activity (75 minutes/week) or aerobic activity in episodes of at least 10 minutes throughout the week have a positive effect and reduces the risk for many adverse health outcomes (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 
2008).  
However, sports participation carries a risk for injuries and in some cases 
can lead to permanent disability (Bahr & Holme 2003).  Vigorous physical 
activity particular may have adverse health effects (van Mechelen et al. 1996). /g3
Although permanent disabilities are uncommon (Kujala et al. 1995b,  Kujala et al. 2003b), the effect of long-standing athletic activity on the development of osteoarthritis should not be neglected (Kujala et al. 1995a, Kujala et al. 2003a). 
Numerous sports-related injuries occur each year, resulting in disability and 
time lost from training in addition to substantial medical costs (McMaster et al. 1998; Murphy et al. 2003). Treatment of sports injuries is often difficult, expensive and time consuming (Parkkari et al. 2001, Kujala et al. 2003b). The 
incidence of sports injuries is high; fortunately, severe injuries are rare (Kujala 
et al. 2003b).  
In Finland, during 2009, 348 000 sports-related injuries were sustained by 
people over age 15 (Haikonen & Parkkari 2010). Numerically, this represents 
the largest category (32%) of injuries reported that year. Sports-related accidents 
were sustained by men more often (68%) than women (32%). Injury risk was 
high in floorball, soccer and ice hockey. A smaller injury risk was observed in 
cross-country skiers and walkers (Haikonen & Parkkari 2010).   
There is a general consensus that the incidence of injury is greater in 
competition than training sessions, especially in soccer (Faude et al. 2005, Hägglund et al. 2009), and previous injury when coupled with inadequate 
18 
rehabilitation, is a risk factor for subsequent injury (Taunton et al. 2003, 
Hägglund et al. 2006). Various methods of preventing sports injuries, such as 
use of insoles, external joint supports and multi-intervention training programs, have been proposed (Parkkari et al. 2001, Aaltonen et al. 2007, Pasanen et al. 2008). Injury prevention remains an important goal for clinicians and 
researchers. 
Our aim was to study the occurrence and consequences of athletic injuries 
in sports with different loading patterns to determine specific injury profiles. We also studied gender differences in sports injuries. Training-related risk factors for an overuse injury were studied among endurance athletes. Athletes 
who reported ending their sports career were interviewed in more detail on the 
mechanisms and consequences of injuries. The target group of this study 
comprised Finnish top-level cross-country skiers, swimmers, long-distance 
runners and soccer players. A twelve-month retrospective study design was 
used.

2.1 Sports injuries   
  “Sports injuries” is a name applied to all types of damage occurring in the 
course of sporting activities (van Mechelen et al. 1992b). Injuries are variously 
defined. The most common definitions are based on time lost from training or 
competitions, or on medical treatment, defined as injuries requiring treatment 
by a physician. However, this may or not result in time lost from training or 
competitions (Brooks & Fuller 2006). 
No consensus exists on definitions of acute and overuse injury (Parkkari et 
al. 2001), and hence definitions vary across studies.  In some studies,  all injuries 
are grouped together, as in Junge et al. (2009)  where the definition (traumatic 
and overuse) was any new musculoskeletal complaint sustained due to competition and/or training that received medical attention irrespective of whether or not it led to absence from competition or training. In the study by 
Yard et al. (2009), a reportable injury was an injury that occurred as a result of 
participation in an organized competition or practice, required medical attention, and resulted in restriction on participation for one or more days beyond the day of the injury. Many of the definitions of a sports injury are based on studies of soccer injuries (Junge & Dvorak 2000, Arnason et al. 2004, Faude et al. 2006). A running-related injury has been defined as an injury to muscles, joints, tendons, and/or bones attributed by the runner to running 
(Macera et al. 1989).  
The problems of definition make it difficult to compare studies (van 
Mechelen et al. 1992b). Differences in study designs also render comparison between studies difficult.  However, how sports injuries are defined is 
important, since the definition used constitutes the basis for research on such 
injuries (van Mechelen 1992b, Junge & Dvorak 2000, Brooks & Fuller 2006) . It 
also guides the data collection and influences the application of the study outcome to sports and exercise medicine (van Mechelen 1992b, Junge & Dvorak 2000, Brooks & Fuller 2006). 
20 
2.1.1 Acute and overuse injuries in sport 
 
Junge and Dvorak (2000)  have defined an acute injury as an injury caused by a 
macrotrauma or as an injury which caused a trauma, the reason being, e.g., 
tackling, kicking or running. Faude et al. (2006) classified a traumatic injury as 
an injury which was caused by a single traumatic incident. An acute injury has also been defined as any injury or condition which did not exist prior to the date of injury occurrence (Giza et al. 2005). In many studies, an acute sports 
injury is defined as injury with a clear onset as a result of trauma, and which 
has occurred in training or competition  (Arnason et al. 2004, Hägglund et al. 
2009),  and has caused at least one day away from training and/or competitions 
(Hawkins & Fuller 1999, Arnason et al. 2004, Alonso et al. 2009) . An acute injury 
has also been described as any physical injury that keeps an athlete away from 
at least one training session or competition, or needs a physician’s care 
(Söderman et al. 2001, Orchard & Seward 2002).  
An overuse injury is defined as an injury which is caused by the 
consequences of repetitive microtraumas  (Junge & Dvorak 2000) . Lüthje et al.  
(1996)  defined an overuse injury as a pain syndrome of the musculoskeletal 
system appearing during physical exercise without any known trauma, disease, 
deformity or anomalia that have given previous symptoms. An overuse injury 
has also been described as an injury with an insidious onset with a gradually increasing intensity of discomfort without an obvious trauma (Arnason et al. 2004). The injury causes worsening pain during or after exercise and 
continuation of loading causes even worse pain and may stop exercise 
completely (Brukner & Bennell 1997, Beck 1998). A chronic injury has also been classified as any injury with insidious progression that existed prior to the date of the injury’s occurrence or an exacerbation of a previously existing condition (Giza et al. 2005).   
2.1.2 Types of acute and overuse injuries  
 
Acute injuries 
 
Sports injuries can be classified according to injury type and tissue. Acute injuries usually occur to the muscle, ligament, or skin. Bone or joint injuries are 
rarer, but can also be more severe (Brukner & Khan 2006). Cramps, strains with 
different grades, and contusion are common acute injuries in the muscle (Brukner & Khan 2006). Cramp is a sudden muscle contraction which is painful and may occur in any muscle, but mostly the calf. The etiology of muscle cramp 
is poorly understood (Maquirriain & Merello 2007). Muscle strain is most 
prevalent in sudden acceleration or deceleration (Pleacher & Glazer 2005). Highest grade muscle tears can be very damaging. The most common strain among athletes is hamstring strain (Croisier 2004). Contusions can result from a direct blow, especially in team sports such as soccer, football, ice hockey and 
21 
basketball. The most common site of muscle contusions is the thigh (Chomiak et 
al. 2000).  
Ligament injuries are strains of various grades from stretched fibers to a 
complete ligament tear with excessive joint laxity (Pleacher & Glazer 2005, Brukner & Khan 2006). Ankle and knee ligament injuries in particular are 
common (Arendt and Dick 1995, Baumhauer et al. 1995, Hägglund et al. 2009). 
Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries are among the most severe knee injuries, limiting training and competition time (Dugan 2005). Moreover, severe injuries in the knee increase the risk for degenerative joint disease (Thelin et al. 2006). Skin injuries include abrasions and lacerations (Basler et al. 2004). Acute 
tendon injury can be a sudden tear of the tendon, the rupture usually occurring 
in an older athlete with history of injury of the tendon (Brukner & Khan 2006). 
The most common acute tendons injuries are either partial or complete rupture 
of the Achilles and supraspinatus tendons (Kannus & Natri 1997). Dislocations 
and subluxations of joint injuries can occur after trauma. The shoulder joint has 
the greatest range of motion of any joint in the body and as a result is 
particularly susceptible to dislocation and subluxation (Good & MacGillivray 
2005). Joint injuries can also result from surrounding joint capsule or ligament injuries (Brukner & Khan 2006). A bone fracture can occur from a direct blow or a fall. Soft tissue damage is often associated with fracture. Also articular cartilage defects may occur in severe joint injuries. Major nerve injuries are 
unusual in athletes. However, the ulnar nerve and the peroneal nerve can be 
injured from a direct blow (Brukner & Khan 2006). Concussion with mild 
traumatic brain injury can be induced by hits and blows on the head. 
 
Overuse injuries 
 
Overuse injuries can occur to the same tissues as acute injuries, but the pathology of these injuries is different. The most common overuse injury occurs to the tendon and is called tendinopathy (Khan et al. 1999). It is prevalent in the 
Achilles, patellar and rotator cuff tendons. There is no clear understanding of 
the pathology of tendinopathy (Khan et al. 1999). Another common overuse injury among athletes is situated in the bursae. Bursae such as the subacromial bursa and greater trochanteric bursa can become irritated and inflamed (Adkins 
& Figler 2000, Pleacher & Glazer 2005). Another overuse injury prevalent 
among athletes is a stress fracture, which is a result of a microfracture in bone caused by repetitive physical loading (Bennell et al. 1996, Iwamoto & Takeda 2003, Snyder et al. 2006). The most common stress fractures occur to the tibia, metatarsals, fibula, tarsal navicular and femur (Iwamoto & Takeda 2003, Laker 
et al. 2007). Among ballet dancers, figure skaters and gymnasts repetitive bone 
stress in the spine may lead to a spondylolysis. Although upper limb stress 
fractures are less common than those of the lower limbs, stress fractures occur 
in sports where athletes are dominantly using an upper limb such as in swimming and tennis (Brukner 1998). 
Overuse injuries in the muscle are focal tissue thickening, chronic 
compartment syndromes and muscle soreness (Pleacher & Glazer 2005, Brukner 
22 
& Khan 2006). Overuse damage to muscle fibers are a result of repetitive 
microtrauma. Focal areas, such as tissue thickening, can be palpated and can 
cause local pain. Overuse damage can also negatively affect rapid contraction 
and relaxation of the muscle (Brukner & Khan 2006). Chronic compartment 
syndrome is the most prevalent in the lower leg (Brukner & Khan 2006). 
Compartment syndrome can also be located in the forearm in, e.g., tennis 
players. Intracompartmental pressure increases and may cause local muscle 
swelling. The thigh fascia prevents expansion of the muscle and impairs the 
blood supply (Englund 2005, McDonald & Bearcroft 2010). Muscle soreness, 
known as delayed onset muscle soreness, is typical 24 to 48 hours after 
unaccustomed physical activity. The etiology of delayed onset muscle soreness 
is still poorly understood (Herbert et al. 2011). 
Joint overuse injuries are inflammatory changes associated with repetitive 
loading, and are known as synovitis or capsulitis. Examples of such injuries are 
sinus tarsi syndrome of the subtalar joint and synovitis of the hip joint (Adkins 
& Figler 2000, Brukner & Khan 2006). Skin overuse injuries are blisters and 
calluses. A blister can occur at any site of friction with an external source, such 
as shoes or sports equipment (Basler et al. 2004).  Dermatologic complaints are 
common among athletes, for example long-distance runners (Jaworski 2005). 
Nerve entrapment syndromes occur as a result of swelling in the surrounding 
soft tissues. Examples of the latter overuse injuries are entrapments in the 
peroneal nerve, suprascapular nerve, posterior tibial nerve at the tarsal tunnel 
and interdigital nerves, a condition known as Morton´s neuroma. Nerve 
entrapment represents an uncommon but important cause of lower limb pain, 
especially among runners (Peck et al. 2010) . Overuse injuries in ligaments are 
rare (Brukner & Khan 2006).  
 
2.1.4 Severity of injuries 
 
In their review, van Mechelen et al. 1992b describe severity according to six 
criteria: the nature of the sports injury, the duration and the nature of treatment, 
sporting and working time lost, permanent damage and costs. Injury severity is 
correlated with the loss of time from training or/and competition. The severity 
of injury and time loss due to injury is defined in many different ways (Table 1). 
 
2.1.5 Recurrent injuries  
 
Fuller et al. (2006) stated in their consensus statement that a recurrent injury 
was an injury of the same type and occurred to the same site as the index injury. 
A recurrent injury occurred after an athlete´s return to full participation from 
the index injury. Moreover, “early recurrence” was defined as a recurrent injury 
that occurred within two months of an athlete´s return to full participation, 
“late occurrence” if the injury occurred 2 to 12 months after full participation 
and “delayed recurrence”, if the injury occurred over 12 months after full 
participation. A recurrent injury has also been defined as an injury that occurs 
to a location on the body that previously sustained the same type of injury 
23 
(Waldén et al. 2006, Swenson et al. 2009), and occurred on the same side as the 
previous injury during the season (Waldén et al. 2006). A subsequent injury was 
defined as any injury to the same or a different body part that occurred after the runner´s initial injury (Rauh et al. 2006). Brooks and Fuller (2006) state that an injury reported as recurrent on the above-mentioned definitions may not be a 
true recurrent injury, as the injury may be in the same muscle group but in a 
different location in the muscle.  /g3

2.2 Injury incidence and prevalence 
 
 
Data obtained from epidemiological studies of sports injuries are necessary for 
developing different strategies for injury prevention and rehabilitation (Brooks 
& Fuller 2006). The most basic measure of injury occurrence is a simple count of 
injured persons (Caine et al. 2006). Other common measures are relative 
24 
proportions of injuries and incidence of injuries (Brooks & Fuller 2006). Injury 
incidence has also been calculated as the number of new sports injuries divided 
by the amount of exposure to injury (Orchard & Seward 2002). Incidence is the occurrence of new cases of injuries in an athlete during a specific period of time (Phillips 2000, Caine et al. 2006, Knowles et al. 2006b), or the number of new 
injuries during a period divided by a total number of sportspeople during that 
time (van Mechelen et al. 1992b, Phillips 2000). 
The injury incidence rate is commonly calculated as the number of injuries 
sustained divided by total time-at-risk, e.g., injuries/1000 exposure hours (Caine et al. 2006). It can also be calculated as injuries/1000 player hours 
(Hawkins & Fuller 1999) or injuries/1000 matches or injuries/1000 athletes-
exposure (Caine et al. 2006). van Mechelen and co-workers (1992b) preferred to 
calculate the incidence of sports injuries in relation to exposure such as hours.  
Rates are then more comparable between different studies. 
 In sports epidemiology, the prevalence of injury is the proportion of 
athletes who have an existing injury at any given point in time (Knowles et al. 
2006b) or the proportion of athletes in a population-at-risk who have an existing 
injury at any given point in time (Caine et al. 2006) .  Prevalence is thus used as 
an estimate of how common a condition is in a population over a certain period of time.  
 
 
2.3 Types of exercise-related loading in different sports  
 
 
Physical loading modalities can be classified into five different exercise loading 
groups: repetitive (non-impact), repetitive (low-impact), high-magnitude, odd-
impact and high–impact (Nikander et al. 2005).  Swimming and cycling 
represent non-impact repetitive sports, cross-country skiing and long-distance 
running represents repetitive low-impact exercise loading, soccer as a contact 
sport represents the odd-impact loading modality, and volleyball is considered to represent high-impact exercise loading (Nikander et al. 2005). As participants in these sports have been selected as a target group in this thesis, their injury profile is reviewed in more detail.  
 
2.3.1 Cross-country skiing 
 
Cross-country skiing is an endurance sport with low-impact exercise loading 
and consists of repetitive pliant movements without impact. Cross-country 
skiing is a common sport in the Nordic countries. However, it is not very 
widely spread; also, studies on skiing injuries are few (Orava et al. 1985, 
Eriksson et al. 1996, Morris & Hoffman 1999, Engebretsen et al. 2010). 
Nowadays there are two dissimilar skiing techniques: the classic technique, 
using traditional diagonal strides and the skating technique, where ski-skating 
predominates. In the classic skiing technique, the spine is loaded from 
25 
repetitive extension to deep flexion movements while in the skating technique 
the spine is held in a more stable and more vertical position (Eriksson et al. 
1996, Bahr et al. 2004). In addition, in the classic style, rotational loading on the low back is common. 
The minimum length of competition skis is the height of the skier minus 
100 mm and the minimum width 40 mm. Skis must weigh at least 750 g per 
pair.  Two poles of equal length must be used with one pole held in each hand. 
Maximum pole length must not exceed the competitor’s height, nor be below the hips (measurements are taken by placing the tip of the pole on the ski in front of the binding). However there are no limitations with regard to the 
material and make of ski boots and bindings. Competition can vary from sprint 
skiing competitions (0.8 – 1.8 km), which are held over  a short period during 
the same day with a short resting time, to long competitions such as the 30 
kilometers in women and 50 kilometers in men in one day (International Ski 
Federation, FIS 2011). 
Cross-country skiing has been recommended as a safe sport and suitable 
activity for physical fitness (Smith et al. 1996). Cross-country skiing is also 
advocated for rehabilitation (Smith et al. 1996). Previous reports have shown a low number of skiing-related injuries in cross-country skiing (Sandelin et al. 1980, Orava et al. 1985, Renstrom & Johnson 1989). The incidence of injuries in cross-country skiing reported in different studies varies between 0.2-3.0 per 
thousand skier days (Westlin 1976, Sandelin et al. 1980, Renstrom & Johnson 
1989, Hunter 1999) or 1.3-2.2 injuries per 1000 exposure hours among the 
Finnish national population aged 15 and over (Haikonen & Parkkari 2010).  
The existence of two different techniques, increased velocity and new 
equipment may increase the number of injuries in cross-country skiing, 
especially among those using the skating technique (Butcher & Brannen 1998).
 
Earlier studies have shown that typical injuries in cross-country skiers are 
localized in the low back (Mahlamäki et al. 1988, Eriksson et al. 1996, Bahr et al. 2004,  Bergstrøm et al. 2004). Some authors have reported that the diagonal (classic) skiing style causes more low back pain to the skier than the skating- skiing style (Eriksson et al. 1996, Bergstrøm et al. 2004, Alricsson & Werner 
2005). However, conflicting rates of low back injury between the skating and 
classic techniques have been reported (Eriksson et al. 1996, Butcher & Brannen 
1998, Bahr et al. 2004).  
Injury to the ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) of the metacarpophalangeal 
(MCP) joint of the thumb (skier´s thumb) is the one of the most common acute 
injury in the upper extremities. It happens when skier falls and the ski pole 
forces the thumb to deviate radially (Renstrom & Johnson 1989, Fricker & 
Hintermann 1995).  
Two-thirds of all injuries in cross-country skiers are overuse injuries 
(Bergstrøm et al. 2004). According to Morris and Hoffman (1999), most overuse 
injuries are caused by errors of technique or by equipment. The other common 
overuse injuries in cross-country skiers are the leg (medial tibial syndrome), the 
ankle (Achilles tendon) and the great toe in the metatarsophalang joint (MTP, 
26 
skier's toe) (Renstrom & Johnson 1989, Fricker & Hintermann 1995,  Morris & 
Hoffman 1999). Usually, injuries are located in the muscles and tendons 
(Sandelin et al. 1980, Renstrom & Johnson 1989). Orava et al. (1985) reported that only 40% of overuse injuries in skiers originated in cross-country skiing. It indicates that cross-country skiing is a safe sport in itself. 
   
2.3.2 Swimming 
/g3
A popular physical activity such as swimming is also an endurance sport which 
has a great number of movements without ground impact. This sport represents the repetitive, non-impact loading modality. In swimming the repetitive loading focus is on the upper extremities. A swimmer performs more than one million strokes annually with each arm and over 90% of the 
propulsive force comes from the upper extremities, and involves repetitive 
overhead movements (Pink & Tibone 2000, Sein et al. 2010). Pink & Tibone 
(2000) reported that elite swimmers with intensive training and competition 
may perform over 2500 overhead movements in a day. To get further in the 
water, the swimmer must use large arm moments (Sein et al. 2010).   
In swimming the most common competition techniques are freestyle, 
backstroke, breaststroke and butterfly, each of which has its own rules. The 
competition swimming pool is 25 or 50 meters long. Since the beginning of 2010 
all swimsuits must be made from textiles and for men may not extend above 
the navel or below the knee, while for women a swimsuit may not cover the 
neck or extend past the shoulder or below the knee (Fédération Internationale 
de Natation, FINA 2011).  
There are many swimming competition seasons during the year. A 
competition event varies from 20 seconds (50 m freestyle) to 14 minutes (1500 m 
freestyle). Swimmers enter many competitions during one or two days and 
resting times between competitions may be short.  
The incidence of at least one swimming injury has been reported to vary 
from 22% to 37% in young elite athletes (Baxter-Jones et al. 1993,   Maffulli et al. 
2005). Bak et al. (1989) reported 0.9 injuries per swimmer per 1000 hours of 
swimming. Wolf et al. (2009) in turn reported an injury incidence of 3.9 injuries 
per 1000 exposures in swimmers. The most common musculoskeletal problem 
among competitive swimmers is shoulder pain (Richardson 1987, Pink & 
Tibone 2000, Wolf et al. 2009, Sein et al. 2010). The reported incidence of 
shoulder injury during one year in swimmers has varied from 26% to 35% (McMaster & Troup 1993, McMaster et al. 1998, Wolf et al. 2009). Overuse shoulder injury in swimmers may be the aetiology leading to instability and 
impingement of the shoulder (Richardson 1987, Allegrucci et al. 1994,  Bak & 
Fauno 1997, McMaster et al. 1998, Pink & Tibone 2000, Weldon & Richardson 
2001) 
Another common location of overuse injuries is the knee (Richardson 
1987,   Rodeo 1999) and the groin (Grote et al. 2004), especially in swimming the 
breaststroke. Low back injuries are also common among swimmers, especially 
27 
swimming the butterfly, because body position in the water is maintained by 
the low back (Richardson 1987, Ferrell 1999). 
 
2.3.3 Long-distance running 
 
Long-distance running represents the repetitive, low-impact exercise loading modality. In long-distance running, the structures of the lower extremities are exposed to a large number of repetitive forces (van Mechelen 1992a, Hreljac 
2004, Laker et al. 2007). 
Running has become a popular form of exercise (van Mechelen 1992a, 
Parkkari et al. 2004, Wen 2007) for which many health benefits have been reported, including a positive effect on cardiovascular health (Thompson et al. 
2007, Schjerve et al. 2008).   Requa et al. (1993) found a higher risk for injury 
from running than, e.g., team sports on the recreational level, whereas Parkkari 
et al. (2004) found running to be safer than team sports.   
 In track and field, long-distance running is usually meant when athletes 
compete distances 3000 meters and over. Long-distance running in particular measures a person´s aerobic fitness. A runner’s number of competitions varies according to his/her race distances. If an athlete competes only in the marathon 
(42.195 km) he/she usually has fewer competitions a year than an athlete 
competing in a 3000-meter event (International Association of Athletics Federations, IAAF 2011).  
Among runners, overall injury incidence rates of from 13 to 17 per 1000 
athletes exposure (Rauh et al. 2000, Rauh et al. 2006), and overall injury rates of 
from 37% to 56% over twelve months  (van Mechelen 1992a, Taunton et al. 2003) have been reported. The incidence rate of overuse injury in runners varies from 2.5 to 12 injuries per 1000 hours of training (Lysholm & Wiklander 1987, van Mechelen 1992a) or from 24% to 68% over twelve months (Lysholm & Wiklander 1987, Marti et al. 1988, Macera et al. 1989, Wen et al. 1997). Injuries in long-distance runners are mainly overuse injuries because of the amount of 
repetition of the same movement (van Mechelen 1992a).  
The etiology of overuse injuries is multifactorial. Overuse injuries may be 
caused by anatomical (Lysholm & Wiklander 1987, Hreljac 2005) or biomechanical factors (Rolf 1995, Hreljac 2005). Running distance, training 
program and exercise type, rapid increase in training intensity or weekly 
running distance has been shown to be associated with running injuries (Lysholm & Wiklander 1987, Marti et al. 1988, Tenforde et al. 2011). Among runners, most of overuse injuries are located in or below the knee - mainly in the knee, lower leg  and ankle (van Mechelen 1992a, Taunton et al. 2002, 
Taunton et al. 2003). The most common overuse running injuries are Achilles 
tendinopathy and patellofemoral pain syndrome (Taunton et al. 2002, Knobloch 
2008).  
   
28 
2.3.4 Soccer 
 
Soccer is a contact sport involving jumping, reversing, rotation, and high risk 
for impacting loads and sprains, and thus represents the odd-impact loading 
modality.  
Soccer is one of the most popular leisure-time and elite physical activities 
globally. Soccer teams have eleven players, one of whom keeps goal. Players wear a shirt, shorts, knee-high socks, shin guards and football boots.  The ball is 
a 68-70-cm sphere and air-filled.  Playing field is 100–110 meters long and 64–75 
meters wide.  A soccer game consists of two halves, lasting 45 minutes each, with a pause between halves lasting not longer than 15 minutes. Soccer is played on grass or artificial turf (Fédération Internationale de Football 
Association, FIFA 2011).  
Soccer studies have shown 13-28 injuries per 1000 match hours or 1-12 
injuries per 1000 training hours (Lüthje et al. 1996, Faude et al. 2005, Giza et al. 
2005, Hägglund et al. 2005, Jacobson & Tegner 2007, Hägglund et al. 2009). 
Injuries are located mainly in the thigh, the knee, the shin and the ankle, 
and are usually contusions and muscle strains or ligament sprains (Kujala et al. 1995b, Junge et al. 2004a, Faude et al. 2005, Jacobson & Tegner 2007). More than 
half of all the acute injuries in soccer are caused by contact with other person, 
for example during tackling situations (Engström et al. 1991,   Hawkins & Fuller 1998, Junge et al. 2004a, Junge et al. 2004b, Faude et al. 2005). Soccer players have fewer overuse injuries than acute injuries, and acute injuries have been the 
main focus of studies (Sandelin et al. 1985, Kujala et al. 1995b, Junge et al. 2004a,  
Hägglund et al. 2009). The reported incidence of overuse injuries varies between 6%-41% (Lüthje et al. 1996,  Peterson et al. 2000, Faude et al. 2005, Giza et al. 2005, Hägglund et al. 2005, Waldén et al. 2005, Ekstrand et al. 2006,  Jacobson & Tegner 2007). The most common anatomical locations of soccer overuse injuries are the knee, lower leg, groin, and low back (Lüthje et al. 1996, Söderman et al. 2001, Hägglund et al. 2005,  Waldén et al. 2005). 
 
 
2.4  Gender differences in sports injuries 
  Generally, patterns of injuries in athletes have been assumed to be more sports-specific than gender-specific. So far, most sports injury studies that have 
investigated gender differences have focused exclusively on knee injuries 
(Arendt & Dick 1995,   Dugan 2005). To date, only a few sports injury studies 
have compared acute injury rates (Kujala et al. 1995b) or overall injury rates (de 
Loës et al. 2000,   Sallis et al. 2001) between genders.  
Previous studies have found rather similar overall injury rates in men and 
women (Lanese et al. 1990,   Sallis et al. 2001). Controversially some sports and 
recreation-related injury studies have shown males to have 1.3-4 times higher 
sports- and recreation-related injury risk than their female counterparts (Conn 
29 
et al. 2003,  Dempsey et al. 2005, Knowles et al. 2006a, Haikonen & Parkkari 
2010). Studies have also reported a higher incidence of soccer-related injuries 
among girls than boys (Elias 2001, Powell & Barber-Foss 2000, Tenforde et al. 2011). However, male athletes have been shown to have a higher risk for severe sports-related injuries than female athletes (Conn et al. 2003). 
Despite gender similarity in the overall injury rate, females have sustained 
more injuries in the hip (Satterthwaite et al. 1999, Sallis et al. 2001), lower leg and shoulder than male athletes, while men have sustained more injuries in the thigh than women (Sallis et al. 2001). In marathon runners, Satterthwaite et al. (1999) noticed that males had 1.6-fold greater risk for hamstring and 1.9-fold 
greater risk for calf injuries compared to female runners.   
de Loës et al. (2000) reported that overall risk of knee injury in 12 sports 
was significantly higher for males than females (0.52 vs. 0.39). Dugan (2005) 
reported that female athletes have a higher risk for a knee injury in jumping 
and cutting sports than male athletes in similar sports. Arendt and Dick (1995) 
also found that knee injuries were more prevalent among female than male 
athletes in soccer. Malinzak et al. (2001) proposed that the cause of these gender 
differences may be that females tend to have increased loads on the anterior cruciate ligament. This loading pattern may increase the ACL injury rate among female athletes.  
 
2.5 Risk factors for sports injuries  
 
 
Risk factors for acute injuries in soccer (Arnason et al. 2004, Ekstrand et al. 2006,  
Faude et al. 2006) are well documented. Several studies have investigated the 
risk factors for overuse injuries in long-distance running (van Mechelen 1992a, 
Taunton et al. 2002, Taunton et al. 2003, Hreljac 2004, Wen 2007), with special 
reference to lower extremity injuries (Macera 1992, Rolf 1995, Wen et al. 1997, 
Hreljac et al. 2000) The risk factors for other sports, such as in swimming, and cross-country skiing are poorly understood. Only a few studies of cross-country skiing (Butcher & Brannen 1998) and swimming (McMaster & Troup 1993) have reported injuries, but usually the risk factors for acute and overuse injuries have 
not been investigated separately.   
The factors hypothesized to contribute to the development of sports-
related injuries can be divided into two categories: extrinsic and intrinsic factors. This distinction is commonly made in the literature (Taimela et al. 1990, 
Rolf 1995, van Mechelen et al. 1996, Bahr & Holme 2003, Murphy et al. 2003, 
Reinking et al. 2007).  
 
2.5.1 Intrinsic risk factors 
 
Intrinsic factors refer to individual biological and psychosocial characteristic 
predisposing a person to the outcome of a musculoskeletal injury. Such factors 
30 
include gender, age, anthropometrics, anatomical factors, training years, injury 
history, menstrual status, physical fitness, and psychological factors (Taimela et 
al. 1990,  van Mechelen et al. 1996, Bahr & Holme 2003, Murphy et al. 2003, Reinking et al. 2007, Wen 2007).  
Many studies have reported that gender is a risk factor for an injury and 
has some effects on the incidence of injuries. These results are conflicting: in 
some studies females have been found to have greater risk for an injury (Hosea et al. 2000, Powell & Barber-Foss 2000, Rauh et al. 2006), especially knee injuries (Arendt & Dick 1995), while in others male athletes have been reported to be more injury prone than female athletes (Hägglund et al. 2009). There are also 
studies that have found no gender difference in injury risk (Baumhauer et al. 
1995,  Bennell et al. 1996). Women have a lower muscle power and the greater 
laxity in the joint than men. This may also lead to the injuries among female 
athletes. 
Among runners, older athletes with more experience were less affected by 
injury (Marti et al. 1988, Taunton et al. 2003). Other studies have found no 
differences between age and injury rate (Wen et al. 1997, Engebretsen et al. 
2010). Runners with more than ten years experience had increased risk for an overuse injury, especially Achilles tendinopathy (Knobloch et al. 2008). 
The relationship between body size, height, weight and body mass index 
(BMI, [kg/m
2]) and risk for an injury is controversial. van Mechelen (1996) 
reported that BMI was not associated with injury risk. Messier et al. (2008) 
found, among runners, that greater body weight was related to larger knee joint 
loading and therefore may be a risk factor for a joint injury. In addition, Thelin 
and co-workers (2006) reported a greater BMI to increase risk for knee 
osteoarthritis.  
Anatomical factors, e.g., leg length inequality, have been reported to be a 
risk factor for lower extremity overuse injury among runners (Wen et al. 1997). 
The role of the range of motion of the joints as a risk for injuries is unclear. Previous injury, e.g., in the hamstring, groin, knee and ankle, have been shown to be a risk factor for an injury in athletes (Walter et al. 1989, Dvorak et al. 2000, Bahr & Holme 2003, Taunton et al. 2003, Arnason et al. 2004, Croisier 2004, 
Engebretsen et al. 2010). 
Among female athletes, menstrual status may influence to the risk for an 
overuse injury. Vigorous training among female athletes, especially when 
accompanied by low energy intake may lead to menstrual disturbances 
(Torstveit & Sundgot-Borgen 2005, Nichols et al. 2006) and  increase the risk for 
injury. Younger age at menarche and a history of irregular menstrual periods 
are associated with increased risk for stress fracture (Kelsey et al. 2007). 
Psychological factors and pressures in turn may increase the risk for menstrual 
disturbances (Brukner & Khan 2006). 
/g3
2.5.2 Extrinsic risk factors 
 
Sports-related risk factors such as type of sport, exposure, nature of event, and 
role of opponents and team mates have been reported (van Mechelen et al. 1996, 
31 
Kujala et al. 2003b). The amount of exposure time has found to be an important 
risk factor for an injury (van Mechelen et al. 1996). In many studies sudden 
increased training or running distance (Walter et al. 1989, Taunton et al. 2003, Tenforde et al. 2011) or running volume (Lysholm & Wiklander 1987) has also been shown to be a risk factor for injuries.  However, Hreljac et al. (2000) found 
no differences between distance run weekly between those who had never 
sustained an overuse lower limb injury attributed to running and those that had sustained at least one overuse injury attributed to running.  
Training errors without enough resting and recovery time and fatigue are 
one of the most important risk factors for an athlete (Taimela et al. 1990,  van 
Mechelen et al. 1996). In team sports, especially in soccer, contact situations 
present risk for an injury (Faude et al. 2006). Injuries are more prevalent in 
soccer matches compared to training in both men and women (Faude et al. 
2005, Hägglund et al. 2009). Equipment, such as shoes, skies and poles, can also 
be a risk factor for an injury. However, Butcher and Brannen (1998) found no 
relationship between equipment and the occurrence of injuries. Training surface 
has been found to be associated with injury risk (Wen 2007). A hard training 
surface increases the risk for stress fractures (Laker et al. 2007).  Knobloch et al. (2008) reported that sand increased the relative risk for mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy by tenfold, while asphalt running decreased it. However, Fuller et al. (2007) found no major differences in the incidence, severity, nature or cause 
of match injuries between playing on natural grass or on artificial turf by either 
male or female soccer players. In addition, climate may play a role in the 
susceptibility to an injury (Taimela et al. 1990). 
 
 
2.6 Sports career termination due to injury 
 
 
Injuries can in severe cases terminate an athletic career in sports. The definition 
of ending a sports career has been described as ending sport at a level where the athlete has practiced and actively competed (Kleiber & Brock 1992). Studies on sports career termination are few, and have usually focused on the psychological factors rather than the role of sports-specific injuries. Most of the 
studies concerning the psychological factors are quantitative and concern, e.g., 
self-esteem and life satisfaction (Perna et al. 1999, Thing 2006, Brown et al. 2009). Studies have also usually focused on either male or female athletes (Drawer & Fuller 2001, Söderman et al. 2002, Thing 2006).   
The role of injuries as a reason for ending an athletic career in sports has 
been little studied. Kettunen et al. (2001) reported that every fifth athlete in a 
sample of former elite male athletes had terminated their career because of an 
injury, and in the study by Drawer & Fuller (2001) injuries accounted for as much as 47% of such cases. Nearly half of Finnish ice hockey players reported that one of the reasons for ending their career in sports was an injury (Vuolle 2008). Studies on this issue have mainly concentrated on team sports like soccer 
32 
(Drawer & Fuller 2001, Söderman et al. 2002), where severe injuries, such as 
ACL injuries, are more common (Söderman et al. 2002, Waldén et al. 2011b). 
There is a lack of studies focusing on athletes who terminate their sports career, and how sports-related injury has influenced this decision.

3 AIMS OF THE STUDY 
 
 
Despite the many sports injury studies there is limited data comparing injury 
profiles in sports with differing loading patterns, injury profiles between 
gender, risk factors for overuse injury and the influence of injuries on career 
termination in one and the same study. 
The main goal of this study was to investigate the consequences of sports 
injuries in sports with different exercise-loading characteristics . The athletes 
represented Finnish top-level men and women cross-country skiers, swimmers, 
long-distance runners and soccer players. 
 
The specific aims of this thesis were: 
1. To compare the occurrence of sports injuries and type of acute and 
overuse injuries, recurrent injuries, and severe injuries between sports 
(I).  
2. To compare the occurrence of sports injuries and types of acute and 
overuse injuries between the genders (II).   
3. To investigate the risk factors for overuse injuries in endurance athletes 
(III). 
4. To describe the injuries which were associated or caused the athletes to 
terminate their sports career (IV).

4 MATERIALS AND METHODS 
 
Finnish top-level cross-country skiers, swimmers, long-distance runners and 
soccer players in 2005 - 2006 were recruited to our twelve-month retrospective 
study. The data were collected with a self-report sports injury questionnaire 
which was sent to the athletes after each competition season.  The study design 
is shown in Figure 1.   
4.1 Athletes 
 
 
The best Finnish male and female cross-country skiers were drawn from the 
ranking list of the Finnish Ski Association. The best swimmers over different 
swimming distances in a 50-m pool in 2005, according to the Fédération 
Internationale de Natation (FINA) points system, were drawn from the Annual 
Yearbook of the Finnish Swimming Association (2005). Similarly, all the female 
and male runners whose personal record in 2005 was better than the C level in 
one of the running distances from 1 500m to the marathon were drawn from the Annual Yearbook of the Finnish Athletics (2005) and included in to the study. Also, male and female soccer clubs who played in the Finnish Premier league were drawn from the list posted on the Football Association of Finland website 
(www.veikkausliiga.com). Members of the teams at the beginning of the season 
were invited to participate. This process yielded 1 200 top-level female and 
male athletes (age 15 - 35 years), representing four different sports and loading 
modalities, three endurance sports and one team sport. They comprised 300 
cross-country skiers, 268 swimmers, 265 long-distance runners and 367 soccer 
players (21 teams). After excluding participants over 35 years of age and soccer 
teams with a low response rate, the final study target group consisted of 1 075 
athletes (Figure 1). 
The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of University 
of Jyväskylä.

4.2 Questionnaire 
 
 
The sports injury questionnaire (21 pages) was mailed to the above-mentioned 
athlete groups after a competition season (Appendix I). The postal 
questionnaire also included sports-specific questions (Appendix II). The 
questionnaire was sent to the cross-country skiers in April 2006, to the 
swimmers in July 2006, to the long-distance runners in September 2006 and to 
the soccer players in October 2006. We re-sent the questionnaire after one 
month to those athletes who did not respond on the first occasion.  
 
4.2.1 Questionnaire (Study I-III) 
 
The questionnaire included items on anthropometry, training history, and 
training and competition volume. The questionnaire included separate items on 
training hours and frequency per week during the training and competition 
seasons as well as on the length of the training and the competition season. On 
the basis of these six questions, the total number of exposure hours per year 
was estimated (Appendix I).  
The structured questionnaire also asked the athletes for details of up to 
five of the most severe acute and overuse injuries they had sustained during the 
past 12 months. In addition, questions were asked about injury location, date of 
injury, the type of exercise that caused the acute injury and injury-related 
possible adverse effects on sports performance. Athletes were also asked about 
the situation (training or competition) in which the injury occurred. The 
questionnaire included an item about possible previous acute or overuse 
injuries in the same anatomic location during the past 12 months. The athletes 
were also asked about absence from training or competition because of acute or 
overuse injury during the past 12 months. Injury rates are reported as number 
of injuries per 1000 exposure hours, i.e. hours of any type of exercise, including 
competitions. Injury rates were calculated separately for acute, overuse and all 
injuries. Female athletes were also asked about their menstrual cycle. In 
addition to the questions concerning all athletes there was sports-specific 
questions. Table 2 shows the basic characteristics of the study group. 
This questionnaire had earlier been validated by comparing questionnaire 
and interview responses after a one-week interval among 54 subjects from 
different sports. The reliability of the background information questions was 
excellent: the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) varied from 0.96 to 0.99 
(p<0.001). The reliability of sports and training information was good or 
excellent (ICC = 0.81 to 0.95, p<0.001). The reliability of questions concerning 
acute and overuse sports injuries during past twelve months varied from 
moderate to good (ICC = 0.75 to 0.88, p<0.001) (Karhula & Pakkanen 2005, 
Eloranta & Tittonen 2006).

4.2.2 Analysis of non-responders (Study I) 
 
To investigate the reasons for non-response, in winter 2007, four months after 
the postal questionnaire, we sent a further one-page questionnaire to the long-
distance runners (99 athletes) who had not responded to the former. The questionnaire contained three questions. The first two questions asked whether the athlete had sustained an acute or an overuse injury during the past twelve months and, if so, how many. The last question concerned the reason not for 
responding the first postal questionnaire. The most commonly reported reason 
for non-response was the length of the questionnaire. 
 
4.2.3 Telephone interview (Study IV)  
 
Seven to eleven months after the first questionnaire, in spring 2007, a semi-
structured questionnaire interview was carried out with athletes who, in the 
postal questionnaire, had reported terminating their sports career because of 
injury in (n=27). Twenty (74%) gave permission for a telephone interview 
(Appendix III).  
The interview included structured and open questions. The injury that 
had influenced the athlete’s decision to end the sports career was studied as 
well as possible non-medical reasons. Detailed information on  the injury which 
had caused them to end the sports career was asked and also what kind of 
treatment and rehabilitations they had received, what disabilities, if any, the 
injury had caused in their life, and whether they still exercised and on what 
level (Appendix III).  
 
 
4.3 Sports injury types and sports career termination 
 
 
The term acute injury was defined as an acute sports injury occurring suddenly 
or accidentally, interrupting the exercise or the competition of the athlete, or 
causing an identifiable trauma. An acute injury is any physical injury that keeps 
the athlete away from at least one training session, or competition, or needs a 
physician’s care (Söderman et al. 2001, Orchard & Seward 2002). The term 
overuse injury was defined as an injury that causes pain during exercise 
loading without any noticeable external cause of injury. The injury gradually causes worsening pain during or after exercise. Pain becomes worse when loading is continued and may prevent exercise completely (Brukner & Bennell 
1997, Beck 1998).  
A recurrent injury was defined a repeat of an acute or overuse injury that 
had been sustained in the same part of the body prior to embarking on the sports career. Time loss was defined as the time athletes were not able to 
participate in training or competitions or the time the athlete needed for 
medical care. Both acute and overuse injuries were classified into three different 
39 
categories: minor  injury,  involving no time loss, 1-3 days time loss, 4-6 days time 
loss; moderate injury,  involving 1-3 weeks time loss; and major injury,  involving 
over 3 weeks but less than 3 months time loss, over 3 months but less than 6 
months time loss, and over 6 months time loss.   
The term "sports career termination" was defined as ending a career in 
sports at a level where the athlete has practiced and actively competed (Kleiber 
& Brock 1992). The sports career was considered ended, including where the 
athlete continued to participate in the same sports, but at a lower level (less 
targeted), or if the athlete had changed sports. 
A menstrual irregularity was defined as 6 menstruations or less per year 
or totally missing menstruation (Bennell & Alleyne 2006).  
 
 
4.4 Statistical analysis 
 
 Statistical analyses were performed with the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS), version 13.0 (study I), version 15.0 (study II – III), and with 
PASW Statistics, version 18.0 (study IV) (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA). 
Frequencies, proportions, mean and standard deviations (SD) were used as descriptive statistics. Pearson chi-square statistics, t-tests and analysis of variance were applied to calculate statistical differences in distributions 
between the different sports. p ≤ 0.05, two-tailed was considered a statistically 
significant threshold. 
/g3
Study I  
 
In the post hoc between-group comparisons, the Bonferroni correction was 
used, and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of the percentages of injuries were calculated with Confidence Interval Analysis software (CIA, University of Southampton, United Kingdom).   
 
Study II 
 
Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied to calculate statistical differences in 
gender distributions and between different sports. Poisson regression was used to calculate the sports-adjusted injury risk between genders. The associations were expressed using relative risks (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI).  
 
Study III 
 
Analysis of variance (ANOVA) with sex and sports as covariates in the 
between-sports analysis and gender as a covariate in the within-sports analyses 
was used to compare athletes without and with tendon, joint, muscle or all the 
other overuse injuries identified. The results of the analyses of the risk factors 
40 
for injuries were adjusted for gender and sports (covariate-adjusted) except for 
the risk factors within each sports, which were as adjusted only by gender, and 
menstrual status, which was adjusted only by sport. Logistic regression models were used to analyze the association between covariates and injuries. Gender and sports were used as covariates in all the logistic regression models. When 
investigating the risk factors for injuries between the different sports, 
swimming was used as the reference sport in all the logistic regression models, except for injuries to the upper extremities, where the corresponding reference sport was running. The associations were expressed using odds ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI). From a clinical point of view, we 
categorised the significant training-related risk and supportive factors for an 
injury.  
 
Study IV 
 
Structured questions were analysed by using descriptive statistics such as frequencies, proportions, means and standard deviations (SD). The non-structured questions from the interview were analysed descriptively.

5 RESULTS 
 
 
The questionnaire was returned by 59% of the cross-country skiers, 62% of the 
swimmers, 62% of the runners, and 55% of the soccer players. The final study group, with a completed questionnaire, consisted of 149 (52%) cross-country skiers, 154 (58%) swimmers, 143 (55%) long-distance runners, and 128 (50%) 
soccer players (Figure 1, see page 35). The proportion of females was 54% 
(n=312) and that of males 46% (n=262). There were differences in age between the responders and non-responders both among the cross-country skiers (23 years [y] vs. 24 y, p=0.024) and swimmers (19 y vs. 20 y, p<0.001), but not 
among the long-distance runners (both 25 y, p=0.85) or soccer players (both 22 
y, p=0.29). No differences were observed between responders and non-
responders in success according to the national ranking lists for the year 2005. 
Reported mean exercise exposure time during the previous twelve month 
was greater among the swimmers (767 exposure hours per year [h/y]) than 
cross-country skiers (564 h/y, p<0.001), long-distance runners (554 h/y, 
p<0.001), or soccer players (560 h/y, p<0.001). Specific training information for 
the male and female athletes in the different sports is given in Table 2 (see page 
37) and other data, e.g. warming up and other exercises, are given in Table 3.   
5.1 Profile of sports injuries (I) 
  
5.1.1 Acute injury 
 
Two hundred and twenty-five athletes (39%, n=225) reported at least one acute 
injury, and a total of 432 acute injuries. The injury rate among soccer players 
during past twelve months was higher than that among skiers (73% vs. 28%, 
p<0.001), swimmers (32%, p<0.001), or long-distance runners (29%, p<0.001). 
Sixty-seven percent of soccer players with an acute injury had two or more 
acute injuries. This was statistically higher than the corresponding percentages 
42 
for cross-country skiers (37%, p=0.001), long-distance runners (44%, p=0.012) or 
swimmers (49%, p=0.036).

 Acute injury rate per 1000 exposure hours was 0.73 among cross-country skiers, 1.01 among long-distance runners, 1.10 among swimmers, and 3.37 among soccer players. When the four sports groups were combined there were no 
differences in exposure hours between injured and uninjured athletes (mean 
589 h/y vs. 628 h/y, p=0.097).  
The most typical acute injury of all acute injuries in the cross-country skiers 
(25%) and soccer players (24%) was the ankle (Table 4). The injury rate in the 
knee was also significantly higher in soccer players (0.98) compared to skiers 
(0.22, p=0.048) (Table 5). In the long-distance runners, the most prevalent acute 
injury occurred to the foot (24%) and,  in the swimmers, to the back (18%) (Table 
4).  
Soccer players had a significantly higher injury rate (3.39) in the lower 
extremities than swimmers (0.91, p<0.001) and skiers (1.64, p<0.001) (Table 5). In addition, runners (2.68) had a higher injury rate in the lower extremities than 
swimmers (0.91, p=0.003) (Table 5). Swimmers had a greater number of acute 
injuries in the upper extremities than cross-country skiers, long-distance 
runners, or soccer players (Table 4). However, the only difference in the injury 
rate per 1000 exposure hours in the upper extremities was found between 
soccer players and long-distance runners

Nearly forty percent (38%) of the injured athletes reported acute muscle cramps 
or muscle strains. Soccer players (34%) more commonly had contusions than the other sport athletes (runners: 7%, p=0.001; skiers: 17%, p=0.041, swimmers: 18%, p=0.049). Soccer players reported more ligament injuries than swimmers 
(55% vs. 25%, p<0.001) or long-distance runners (55% vs. 20%, p <0.001). Only 
soccer players reported injuries to the knee meniscus. The proportion of athletes with at least one acute injury type is shown in Figure 2.   
 
 
FIGURE 2 The proportion of acute injuries sustained by athletes reporting at least one acute injury (n=225). 
 
  Eighty percent of cross-country skiers’ acute injuries occurred in a sports (including roller skiing) other than their own sports and over one-third (35%) of them occurred while running. Nearly sixty percent of swimmers’ acute injuries 
(58%) also occurred in a sports other than in their own.
 
Fifty-three percent of swimming injuries were related to swimming 
freestyle. Half of runners’ acute injuries occurred in running (49%). The most 
common reason for an acute injury in soccer players occurred in tackling (32%), 
collisions with other player (23%) and running (21%). In soccer, defenders (33%) 
and strikers (33%) most commonly reported at least one acute injury during the 
past twelve months.  
Half of the soccer players’ (49%) acute injuries occurred during matches, 
which was more common than in the case of cross-country skiers (17%, 
p<0.001), long-distance runners (13%, p<0.001) or swimmers (9%, p<0,001). 0 5 10 15 20 25 30Meniscus in juryWoundLuxationFractureLigament ruptureMuscle crampUnidentified painMuscle strainContusion (Bruise)Ligament strain

Most of the acute injuries occurred when playing on either natural grass (52%) 
or artificial turf (38%). Every second acute injury in soccer (54%) occurred in a 
contact situation. Soccer players reported equal occurrence of acute injuries in the first and the second half of matches (49%, 51% respectively). 
 
5.1.2 Overuse injury 
 
Two hundred and ninety-two (51%, n=292) athletes reported at least one 
overuse injury, and a total of 433 overuse injuries. There was no difference in 
the overuse injury rate between long-distance runners (59%), swimmers (51%) and cross-country skiers (50%) in the past twelve months. However soccer players had a lower overuse injury rate than long-distance runners (42% vs. 
59%, p=0.005). The overuse injury rate per 1000 exercise hours was 1.35 in cross-
country skiers, 1.48 in swimmers, 1.67 in long-distance runners, and 1.69 in 
soccer players. Thirty-nine percent of cross-country skiers, 38% of long-distance 
runners, 35% of swimmers, and 28% of soccer players with an overuse injury 
had two or more overuse injuries. 
The most typical location of all overuse injuries in the long-distance 
runners, soccer players and cross-country skiers was the foot (41%, 28% and 
22%, respectively) (Table 6). Among the long-distance runners with one overuse 
injury, 20% was located in the Achilles tendon. In the swimmers over 75% with at least one overuse injury had an overuse injury in the shoulder region. Swimmers reported overuse injuries in the shoulder more commonly than 
cross-country skiers (p<0.001) (Table 6), and the overuse injury rate per 1000 
exposure hours in the upper extremities was also higher among swimmers (Table 7). Soccer players had a higher overuse injury rate in the back (0.69) compared to runners (0.18, p=0.011). The injury rate in the lower extremities was higher in soccer players, runners and cross-country skiers compared to swimmers (Table 7). 
Nearly fifty percent (47%) of long-distance runners, 41% of cross-country 
skiers, and 35% of soccer players reported at least one overuse injury in the 
tendon. Runners had tendon injuries more commonly than swimmers (28%, p=0.011). In swimmers, the most typical overuse injury was a joint injury (34%). A joint overuse injury was more prevalent in swimmers than in cross-country 
skiers (16%, p=0.011), soccer players (15%,  p=0.013) or long-distance runners 
(13%, p=0.001). The proportions of the different types of overuse injury type reported by all the athletes are shown in Figure 3 (see page 47).

FIGURE 3 The proportions of overuse injuries sustained by athletes reporting at 
least one overuse injury (n=292). 
 
 
Over eighty percent (81%) of swimmer’s overuse injuries were related to their own sports, and over forty percent (42%)  of swimming injuries were sustained 
in freestyle events. Cross-country skiers reported that 61% of all overuse 
injuries occurred in sports other than in their own. Among the overuse injuries 
which occurred in cross-country skiing (n=51), 67% occurred in skiing with the classic technique and 33% in skiing with the skating technique. Overuse injuries of the low back sustained in skiing were more frequent with the classic (59%) 
than skating technique (12%). Runners whose main distance was over 3000 
meters had at least one overuse injury (60%) more often than runners with a distance below 3000 meters (40%, p=0.011).   
5.1.3 Severity of injuries   
 
Over half of the acutely injured soccer players (56%) had a major injury and 
more than 3 weeks lost from training and competition (Figure 4). In ten cases 
(16%) the injury was so severe that it caused over 3 months’ absence from 
training and competition. Among soccer players, the main reported reason for 
absence from training and competition over three weeks was an acute knee 
injury (40%) or ankle injury (24%). Nearly fifty percent (46%) of long-distance runners had a major acute injury (Figure 4), the main site being the foot (47%) and in six out of nine such cases the injury was to the Achilles tendon (67%). In 
turn, 65% of injured swimmers, and 49% of injured cross-country skiers had 
only minor injuries (time loss 6 days or less) (Figure 4).  01020304050

FIGURE 4 Time loss from training and competition by sport among athletes 
with an acute injury. Soccer players had higher prevalence of major injuries compared to cross-country skiers and swimmers (p<0.001), and long-distance runners had higher prevalence of major injuries compared to swimmers 
(p=0.004) and skiers (p=0.019). 
 
 
Soccer players had significantly longer mean loss of time (56 days/year, [d/y]) 
from training and competition due to an acute injury compared to cross-
country skiers (17 d/y, p <0.001) and swimmers (56 d/y vs. 12 d/y, p<0.001). 
No difference in time lost was observed between soccer players and long-
distance runners (56 d/y vs. 44 d/y, p=0.35). However, long-distance runners 
reported more time loss during the past twelve months than either skiers 
(p=0.019) or swimmers (p=0.004).  
A similar trend was seen among athletes with an overuse injury. Again, 
soccer players and runners had longer absences from training and competition 
compared to skiers and swimmers. Over half of injured runners (52%), and 41% 
of soccer players had sustained a major injury during the past twelve months 
(Figure 5). The main reported reason for absence from training and competition 
was a foot overuse injury, including the Achilles tendon, both in long-distance 
running (46%) and in soccer (41%). Achilles tendon injury caused the most time 
lost among runners (20%). 
Sixty-six percent of skiers reported only a minor injury (Figure 5). The 
reported mean time lost from training and competition due an overuse injury 
was longer in the long-distance runners than cross-country skiers (53 d/y vs. 10 
d/y, p<0.001), or swimmers (53 d/y vs. 11 d/y, p<0.001). No difference in time 
lost was observed between long-distance runners and soccer players (53 d/y vs. 
48 d/y, p=0.65). However, soccer players (48 d/y) reported longer mean time lost than swimmers (11 d/y, p=0.001) or skiers (10 d/y, p<0.001).  0 %20 %40 %60 %80 %100 %

5.2.4 Recurrent injuries 
 
Thirty-seven percent of the runners’ acute injuries were recurrent. In the cross-
country skiers the proportion of recurrent injuries was 42%, in swimmers 43%, 
and in soccer players 32%. Among the skiers, every third recurrent injury was 
located in the ankle (30%) or back (30%). Seven out of eight recurrent injuries to 
the ankle were ligament strains and ruptures. In the swimmers, the most 
common recurrent injury was located in the back (24%), while, as among the 
runners, recurrent injuries were also located in the foot (22%) and ankle (22%). 
In soccer players the most common anatomical site of a recurrent acute injury 
was the ankle (34%), and 48% of ankle injuries were reported to be ligament 
strains and 38% ruptures. 
Over fifty percent (55%) of the swimmers’ overuse injuries were recurrent, 
mostly located in the shoulder region (59%), and 38% of shoulder injuries were 
reported to joint injuries. Runners and skiers reported an equal amount of 
recurrent injuries (37% and 34%, respectively). Among the runners the overuse 
recurrent injuries were most commonly in the foot (36%) and were usually 
tendon injuries (82%). Skiers reported overuse recurrent injuries equally to the 
low back, knee, calf and foot (20%). Twenty percent of soccer players had a 
recurrent overuse injury. The most common injury site was the back (38%) and 
the foot (31%).

5.2 Gender differences in sports injuries (II) 
 
 
During the past twelve months, female athletes trained on average less than 
men (566 h/y vs. 636 h/y, p=0.002), especially in soccer (445 h/y vs. 584 h/y, 
p=0.001). However, female athletes, especially in cross-country skiing and long-
distance running, did more stretching (80%) than male athletes (71%, p=0.015). 
Female athletes also did additional exercises more often than male athletes (67% 
vs. 56%, p=0.011), especially the skiers (64% vs. 35%, p<0.001). 
 
Acute injury 
 
A significantly higher proportion of male (92%) than female soccer players (79%, p=0.037) reported at least one injury (acute and overuse together) during past twelve months. The same trend was also seen in long-distance runners, 
among whom 82% of male and 68% of female runners reported at least one 
injury (p=0.060). More male than female athletes reported at least one acute 
injury (44% vs. 35%, p=0.022), and especially in soccer (84% vs. 64%, p=0.010) 
(Figure 6). However, after acute injuries were calculated per 1000 exposure hours (training and competition hours during year combined), no difference between men (1.53) and women (1.43, p=0.70) was found.   
Among the athletes with at least one acute injury we found only a few 
gender differences in injury location. A higher proportion of female than male athletes had an acute injury in the heel (6% vs. 1%, p=0.045). However, 4% of the male but none of the female athletes had an acute injury in the upper back (p=0.028). Muscle injuries were more common in male than female athletes with 
at least one acute injury (44% vs. 31%, p=0.048). Female athletes had a higher 
rate of acute ligament injury than male athletes (46% vs. 33%, p=0.044), and in 
soccer (71% vs. 42%, p=0.005). The rate of acute injury in the ankle per 1000 
exposure hours was significantly higher in female than male athletes (0.86 vs. 
0.44, p=0.014), especially among soccer players (1.47 vs. 0.61, p=0.010). 
 Overuse injury 
 
The only gender difference in overuse injury in the different sports was found 
in the long-distance runners, where male runners had a higher prevalence of at 
least one overuse injury than females (69% vs. 51%, p=0.035) (Figure 6). No 
difference was found between men and women when the proportion of overuse 
injuries was calculated per 1000 exposure hours (1.31 vs. 1.73, p=0.16).

FIGURE 6 The proportions of acute and overuse injuries by sport between male 
and female athletes (A: at least one acute injury, O: at least one overuse injury). Male runners more often had an overuse injury than females (p=0.035). Male soccer players more often had an acute injury than females (p=0.010).  
 
 
A higher proportion of male athletes had overuse injuries in the posterior thigh than females (8% vs. 1%, p=0.005), especially soccer players (17% vs. 0%, p=0.020). After adjustment for sports, male athletes were at increased risk for 
posterior thigh overuse injuries compared to females (RR 5.82, 95% CI 1.28 to 
26.39, p=0.022 ). In addition, more males reported toe (4% vs. 0%, P=0.016) and 
upper back (4% vs. 1%, p=0.036) overuse injuries than females. A higher 
proportion of female athletes had overuse injuries in the ankle (9% vs. 3%, p=0.032), and wrist (5% vs. 1%, p=0.051) than males. After adjustment for sports, the risk for an overuse ankle injury was greater in females than males (RR 3.05, 95% CI 1.004 to 9.27, p=0.049). Among cross-country skiers, a higher 
proportion of female than male skiers had overuse injuries in the heel (14% vs. 
0%, p=0.035). No gender differences were observed in the proportion of overuse injuries by tissue type. Ankle overuse injuries per 1000 exposure hours were significantly more common in female than male athletes (0.21 vs. 0.04, p=0.024). 
When acute and overuse injuries of the ankle and the knee in all sports 
were combined, no differences were found in the proportion of injured athletes between females (49%) and males (41%, p=0.13), except in female and male soccer players (75% vs 54%, p=0.025). 
Menstrual irregularities were reported by 40 (13%) women and these were 
more common among long-distance runners (26%) than soccer players (6%, 
p=0.002) or swimmers (6%, p=0.001). Cross-country skiers (16%) reported   
menstrual irregularities more often than swimmers (6%, p=0.049) and the same 
trend was seen in soccer players (6%, p=0.072). Athletes with menstrual 020406080100

irregularities more commonly had at least one overuse injury compared to 
athletes with regular menses (63% vs. 49%, p=0.10). However, among cross-
country skiers, a difference in overuse injuries between athletes with regular and those with irregular menses (46% vs. 85%, p=0.010) was found. Females with fewer than 6 menses during past year or no menses at all had a higher  
prevalence of at least one overuse injury in the lower extremities (92%) 
compared to females with regular menses (67%, p=0.012).   
5.3 Risk factors for overuse injuries among endurance athletes (III)  
  
All overuse injuries 
 
The endurance sports in this study were cross-country skiing, swimming and 
long-distance running. Athletes with at least one injury were on average one 
year older than those with no injury (gender- and sports-adjusted means, 22 y 
vs. 21 y, p=0.013). This was especially evident in long-distance runners (gender- 
adjusted means 25 y vs. 23 y, p=0.007).  
The average number of training camp days (p=0.035) was higher and 
weekly resting and recovery days during the training season (p=0.006) lower in 
athletes who had an injury than those without an injury. The covariate-adjusted 
mean of exposure hours was higher in the athletes with an injury compared to those with no injury (p=0.12). The menstrual cycle had begun on average earlier 
in athletes with than those without injury (p =0.025). Athletes (gender-adjusted) 
with low BMI (less than 21) had more overuse injuries in the lower extremities 
(p=0.015), especially in the foot (p=0.010). 
Sports, gender, age, training camp days during the year, and weekly 
resting and recovery days in the training season  were  entered into a logistic 
regression analysis to identify independent predictors for injuries. According to 
our multivariate model, age increased the risk for an injury (OR 1.06/year; 95% 
CI 1.01 to 1.11, p=0.022) and the number of weekly resting and recovery days in 
the training season had a preventive effect (OR 0.66/day; 95% CI 0.44 to 0.995, 
p=0.047). Odds ratios for all overuse injuries are shown in Table 8 (see page 55). 
From a clinical point of view, we also categorised the significant training-
related risk and supportive factors for an injury. Risk for an injury was increased in athletes with less than two weekly resting and recovery days 
during training season (OR 5.16; 95% CI 1.89 to 14.06, p=0.001), and in athletes 
with over 700 exposure hours during year (OR 2.10; 95% CI 1.21 to 3.61, p=0.008 
increased in athletes with more than 12 years of active training (OR 1.67; 95% CI 
1.11 to 2.52, p=0.014). 
 
 
 
 
 
53 
Tendon injuries 
 
Ninety-two athletes (21%, 92/441) had 102 tendon injuries. The most common 
anatomical sites for a tendon injury were the Achilles tendon (23%), knee region 
(21%), and shoulder region (15%). The risk for tendon injury was 2.26 -fold (95% 
CI 1.26 to 4.04, p=0.006) in long-distance runners compared to swimmers. One-
fifth of the cross-country skiers had at least one tendon injury.  
Athletes with a tendon injury were on average two years older than 
athletes without such an injury (gender- and sports-adjusted, p<0.001). Exposure hours during the past year were not associated with tendon injuries, but athletes with at least one tendon injury compared to athletes without such 
an injury on average reported fewer weekly resting and recovery days during 
the training season (p=0.026). Athletes with a tendon injury had started their 
sporting career one year later (p=0.049), but reported more years of active 
training (p=0.003) than athletes without such injury. The number of kilometres 
run during the past year were not associated with a tendon injury when 
runners with or without a tendon injury were compared (3331 km vs. 3172 km, 
p=0.61). Athletes with lower BMI had more tendon injuries than athletes with 
higher BMI (p=0.004).  
 Odds ratios for tendon overuse injuries adjusted by sport, gender and age 
are shown in Table 8 (see page 55). 
 
Joint injuries 
 
Fifty-nine joint injuries occurred in 50 athletes. In half of the runners  (6/12) and 
over forty percent (6/13) of the skiers, the joint injury occurred to the knee. In swimmers, nearly sixty percent (20/34) of joint injuries were in the shoulder region. Athletes with a joint injury on average reported a lower number of 
competitions than athletes without a joint injury (p =0.013). The mean number of 
kilometres swum during the past year was higher in swimmers with at least 
one joint injury than in swimmers without such an injury (1750 km vs. 1437 km, 
p=0.031). 
Sports, gender, age, BMI, exposure hours during a year, and number of 
competitions  were  entered into a logistic regression analysis to identify 
independent predictors for joint injuries. The number of competitions during 
the past year was a preventive factor for a joint injury (OR 0.95/unit decrease; 95% CI 0.91 to 0.0995, p =0.029). Specific odds ratios are shown in Table 8 (see 
page 55). 
Athletes with a BMI higher than 21 were more prone to a joint overuse 
injury (p=0.001) than athletes with a BMI lower than 21. There was also a trend 
towards more low back overuse injuries among athletes with higher BMI 
(p=0.064).  
 
 
  
54 
Muscle injuries 
 
Eighty-nine muscle injuries occurred in 75 athletes (17%, 75/441). The most 
common anatomical sites for a muscle injury were the shin and calf combined 
(25%), low back (20%) and shoulder region (20%). Nearly sixty percent (58%) of 
swimmers’ muscle injuries were in the shoulder region, while both runners and 
skiers had the most shin and calf muscle injuries (39%, 33%, respectively). Low 
back muscle injuries (30%) were also common among skiers. Athletes with a muscle injury were slightly heavier than those without a muscle injury 
(covariate-adjusted mean 67 kg vs. 65 kg, p =0.052), and a tendency (p=0.064) for 
athletes with a lower BMI to report a muscle injury was found. 
Sports, gender, age and weight were entered into a logistic regression 
analysis to identify the risk factors for muscle injury. The only risk factor found 
for a muscle injury was weight (OR 1.04/kg increase, 95%CI 1.001 to 1.08, p=0.043). The odds ratios are shown in Table 8 (see page 55). 
 
 
5.4 Sports career termination due to injury (IV) 
 
 
Fifty-two athletes (9%, 52/548) reported to terminating their sports career. The proportion of athletes ending their career was higher among females than males (13%, 40/304 vs. 5% 12/244, respectively, p<0.001). Of the athletes who had ended their sports career, over forty percent (42%) were swimmers, 23% long-
distance runners, 19% soccer players, and only 15% cross-country skiers (Figure 
7). In soccer, all the athletes who did not continue playing were female.

Eleven athletes reported total 18 acute injuries as the main or contributory 
reason. Half of the acute injuries occurred to the knee, and were severe ligament 
injuries and contusions. Another common injury was an ankle ligament injury. Fourteen athletes reported 20 overuse injuries as the reason for ending their career. The overuse injuries were located mainly in the shoulder region (30%) 
and in the knee region (25%), and were mainly joint injuries. 
Athletes who reported to ending their sports career because of injury were 
an average two and a half years older (24 y vs. 22 y, p=0.006) than those who continued the sport. The incidence of acute (2.96 vs. 1.41, p=0.015) and overuse injuries (2.76 vs. 1.36, p=0.015) per 1000 exposure hours in athletes who ended 
their career was higher than in the ones who continued their career. However, 
no difference in mean exposure hours between athletes who continued and 
athletes who terminated their sports career was found (617 h/y vs. 622 h/y, 
p=0.92). Athletes who ended their sport reported fewer competitions during the 
past year (13 vs. 23, p<0.001) and fewer training camp days (9 vs. 21, p=0.008) 
than athletes who continued their sports career. Athletes who ended their 
career reported slightly more time away from training and competitions 
because of an acute injury (66 d/y vs. 34 d/y, p=0.055) and significantly more because of an overuse injury (83 d/y vs. 27 d/y, p<0.001) than athletes who continued in their sport. Most of the athletes who terminated their sports career (70%, 19/27) reported that the injury caused mild or moderate permanent 
disability.  
 
Telephone interview 
 
Twenty out of 27 athletes gave permission for a telephone interview (Figure 1, see page 35). Eleven of the 20 athletes had stopped their sports career completely and four had made a come-back in the same sports at a lower level. Five of the twenty athletes (25%) were continuing their sports career on the same level as earlier. Two of them had only minor injuries and three had 
undergone surgery and recovered well enough to be able to continue their 
sports career. Altogether, fifteen athletes (12 female, 3 male; 3 cross-country skiers, 5 swimmers, 3 long-distance runners and 4 soccer players) were interviewed in more detail. 
All the swimmers who ended their career had a shoulder injury. The 
diagnoses of the shoulder injury were various (i.e. fracture/luxation, nerve compression). All the soccer players who had ended their career were female and had an acute knee ligament injury. Three of them had an ACL injury in both knees. Among the cross-country skiers, the main reason to end the career 
was a stress fracture in the shin or hip region. In long-distance runners, the 
injuries were occurred mainly to the knee or low back. The reasons were 
recurrent knee menisci injury and patella luxation. In addition to the injury, 
other reasons such as studying, lack of motivation and pregnancy influenced the decision to end the career. In twelve athletes, a severe acute or overuse injury caused a loss of time from training and competition of over 30 days, with 
a mean of 132 d/y (range 30-270 days).

6 DISCUSSION 
  Our twelve-month retrospective study was designed to investigate injury profiles among Finnish top-level athletes in four sports with different exercise-loading characteristics (cross-country skiing, swimming, long-distance running, 
and soccer). The study was carried out with a postal questionnaire (Appendix I, 
II) sent after the competition season and asking about training habits and possible injuries during the past twelve months. A telephone interview (Appendix III) was conducted seven to eleven months after the postal 
questionnaire with athletes who reported having ended their sports career 
because of injury. 
 
Strengths and limitations 
 
The designs of the different sports-related injury studies differ, which renders 
comparison between studies difficult (Westlin 1976, Sandelin et al. 1980, 
Renstrom & Johnson 1989, Hunter 1999, Junge & Dvorak 2000, Taunton et al. 
2003,  Maffulli et al. 2005, Brooks & Fuller 2006). In seeking to determine the 
etiology of injuries and possible means of injury prevention, it seems crucial to 
draw a distinction between acute and overuse injuries. In addition, sports-specific analyses are needed to determine the specific risk factors for the injuries typical to individual sports in order to help in their prevention.  
Our study used retrospective self-reports to document injuries, as it is very 
difficult to organize a prospective standardized nation-wide survey to cover a 
range of individual sports, along with a standardized examination conducted 
by a physician and standardized recording of the risk factor for all the separate 
injuries. Our data-gathering methodology means that some limitations need to 
be kept in mind when interpreting the results. First, some suspected risk factors 
for injuries are difficult or impossible to study with a postal questionnaire. 
Secondly, retrospective survey studies suffer from two main categories of recall 
bias: memory decay, which means loss of information due to failure to recall the event, and the telescoping effect, which is the tendency to remember events in 
58 
the past as if they occurred closer to the present than they actually did (Harel et 
al. 1994). 
In their review, Walter and Hart (1990) concluded that retrospective 
surveys are less likely to provide accurate incidence data because of they rely on athletes’ responses and thus on diagnoses that lack verification by a 
physician. Junge and Dvorak (2000) found that the one-year incidence of 
injuries reported retrospectively was significantly lower than that documented on the basis of weekly follow-up examinations. However, in their methodological study on skiing and snowboarding injuries, Flørenes et al. (2011) found that retrospective athlete interviews was the best method to detect 
injuries sustained during one World Cup season better than prospective 
registration by team medical staff. Gabbe et al. (2003) in turn reported both 
overreporting and underreporting in a self-report survey. In particular, minor 
injuries may have been underreported. Also, according to Gabbe et al. (2003), 
recall accuracy declines as the level of detail requested increases. The exact 
diagnosis of an injury can be difficult. In the present study memory bias with 
respect to an injury type or diagnosis is possible. Therefore we did not analyse 
injuries more specifically. It is also difficult for athletes to separate different types of injuries, such as a joint, a ligament, a muscle or a tendon injury. However, while there may be limitations on the accurate recall of injuries, athletes tend to have close relations of co-operation with physicians regarding 
their medical problems, and  also know about more their injuries than other 
laymen.  
Moreover, our questionnaire was validated and its reliability found to be 
accurate when evaluated against interview data (see methods, page 34) 
(Karhula & Pakkanen 2005, Eloranta & Tittonen 2006). Questions which were 
accurate or unclear were not used. Our questionnaire was also sent 
immediately after the competition season, while elite athletes usually keep a 
training diary, which can be expected to improve the accuracy of the questionnaire data collection. Further, ending a sports career is such a “big thing“ in an athlete’s life, that it is reasonable to assume that the athlete can accurately remember the possible injury in question. A further strength in 
studying athletes who ended their sports career was the use of a telephone 
interview by semi-structural questionnaire, which gave additional and more 
specific information about the reasons for termination.   
The response rate was low, although comparable to other retrospective 
epidemiological sports injury studies (Maffulli et al. 2005,   Rauh et al. 2006). 
One reason for the low response rate may have been the length of the 
questionnaire, which was 21 pages long. Long-distance runners responded to 
their one-page questionnaire that its length was the main reason for non-
response. The somewhat low response rate of the soccer players might be due 
to the fact that we sent the questionnaire after the competition season, when the 
members of each team were having a break from training and competition. 
However, to avoid using biased data, we excluded the teams with a low 
response rate. 
59 
The athletes who participated in the study were on a high competitive level. In 
this respect, it was reasonable to compare different types of sports. Also, the 
method was the same for all the sports studied, and each sport was represented by nearly same number of athletes. In addition, no association between position in the ranking list and response rate was found between responders and non-
responders. Admittedly, we do not have exact knowledge on whether those 
who did not respond had fewer injuries; however, but this possible selection bias should be rather similar in all sports.  
  
6.1 Profiles of sports injuries 
 
 
The number of subjects with at least one acute injury was highest in the soccer 
players. Half of the acute injuries occurred during matches. Earlier studies have 
found a high prevalence of injuries sustained during matches (Faude et al. 2005, 
Hägglund et al. 2009).  Incidence of the overuse injuries was highest in the long-
distance runners. Interestingly, among cross-country skiers both acute and 
overuse injuries occurred mainly in sports other than their own event. This has 
been reported earlier for overuse injuries (Orava et al. 1985), but not for acute injuries. The acute injuries of the swimmers occurred mainly when practising another sport, while their overuse injuries occurred mainly when swimming. This is in the line with earlier studies on acute injuries (Baxter-Jones et al. 1993) 
and overall injuries (Wolf et al. 2009), although acute and overuse injuries have 
not usually been differentiated or the type of training context specified. 
Swimmers had more acute and overuse injuries in the shoulder region 
than the athletes in the other sports. In turn, a high proportion of acute and 
overuse injuries were located in the lower extremities in cross-country skiers, 
long-distance runners and soccer players. Among skiers and runners the main 
acute and overuse injury location was the foot, including the Achilles tendon. 
Type of loading was strongly associated with the anatomical location of an overuse injury, as shown by the difference in shoulder injury incidence between swimmers and cross-country skiers. In our study, the proportions of shoulder injuries in cross-country skiers were much lower than has been reported earlier 
(Smith et al. 1996). 
 
Cross-country skiing 
 
According to the review by Smith et al. (1996), the incidence rate of injuries in 
skiers has varied from 0.5 to 5.6 injuries per 1000 skier-days. In our study, the  
acute injury rate among skiers was counted in exposure hours, and was lower 
than in an earlier Finnish population-based study, where it varied from 1.3-2.2 
per 1000 exposure hours (Haikonen & Parkkari 2010). Because of 
methodological differences, our incidence rate cannot be directly compared to 
the earlier results, but it can be compared to the rates in the other sports 
60 
included in our study. Our acute and overuse injury rate per 1000 exposure 
hours in skiers was lower than in the other sports. Also both acute and overuse 
injuries originating in their own event were rare in skiers. Our findings are in accordance with earlier findings (Sandelin et al. 1980, Orava et al. 1985, Renstrom & Johnson 1989). 
Acute and overuse injuries in skiers occurred mainly in the lower 
extremities. The most common acute injury was in the ankle. Smith et al. (1996) reported that the most common location of traumatic injuries was in the knee and the second most common in the ankle. However, in our study, ankle injuries were three-fold compared to knee injuries. In skiers, ankle injuries may 
be common due to training for a sports other than their own, such as running. 
We found only a few skiers with an injury in the shoulder region, although the 
shoulders are intensively load during skiing. In contrast, Smith et al. (1996) 
reported that every third of skiers’ upper extremity injuries occurred to the 
shoulder. They also reported that every third of skiers had an acute injury in the 
upper extremities; such injuries were observed in only eleven percent of our 
sample of skiers.  Two-fifths of our athletes’ acute injuries were ligament 
injuries, sprains and strains; this finding is in line with Smith et al. (1996).  
Orava et al. (1985) reported that the most common overuse injury among 
skiers was the foot in addition to the back and knee. In our study, the skiers had at least one overuse injury usually in a tendon or muscle. In Orava et al. (1985) 
the most prevalent injury types occurred in bone and muscle.  
In cross-country skiing two dissimilar techniques are used. In particular, 
the skating technique, with increased velocity and novel equipment, may 
increase the number of injuries (Butcher & Brannen 1998). The literature 
exhibits conflicting opinions regarding the injury rate linked to the skating and 
classic techniques in cross-country skiing (Eriksson et al. 1996, Butcher & 
Brannen 1998, Bahr et al. 2004). In our study, overuse injuries of the low back 
were significantly more frequent when skiers were using the classic technique. Due to low number of the acute and overuse injuries in the cross-country skiers tht originated in their own event, we did not have enough statistical power to study the possible effect of skiing style on the injury rate in more detail. 
  
 
Swimming 
 Over thirty percent of our swimmers had at least one acute injury, which is in line with earlier findings (Baxter-Jones et al. 1993, Maffulli et al. 2005, Wolf et al. 2009). As in Baxter-Jones et al. (1993), our swimmers’ acute injuries occurred more often in another sports than their own main event. The same trend was 
seen in the study by Wolf et al. (2009) where nearly 40% of overall injuries were 
the result of other activities. In Wolf et al. (2009) the overall injury rate of 
collegiate swimmers, including both men and women, were 3.9 injuries per 
1000 exposure hours. In our swimmers the injury rate was smaller (2.6 injures per 1000 exposure hours). The differences may due to the different definitions used. An exposure was defined in Wolf et al. (2009) as participation in one 
game, one practice, strength training, or conditioning session, or one cross-
61 
country activity, whereas we combined annual exposure hours from reported 
training hours per week in training and competition seasons. 
The most common acute injuries were located in the back, knee, and 
shoulder region. As expected, swimming injuries commonly were localised in the upper extremities, especially in the shoulder region. Similarly, earlier 
studies have reported a shoulder injury among every third swimmer with a 
swimming-related injury (McMaster & Troup 1993, McMaster et al. 1998, Wolf et al. 2009). Larger proportions of shoulder injuries and pain have also been reported (Richardson 1987). The differences in numbers may be due differences in methods and definitions of injuries. Bak et al. (1989) investigated shoulder 
pain over one year, as in our study, while McMaster and Troup (1993) and 
McMaster et al. (1998) reported current shoulder pain. In the study by 
McMaster and Troup (1993), athletes were asked if they had ever had shoulder 
pain.   
The considerable incidence of an overuse injury in the shoulder is 
understandable because a swimmer performs more than one million strokes 
annually with each arm. In addition, almost all of the propulsive force comes 
from the upper extremities. Incorrect biomechanics, errors of technique and the large number of repetitive movements can cause microtrauma to structures in the shoulder, and thus influence the occurrence of overuse injuries (Richardson 1987, Pink & Tibone 2000). Studies have proposed that overuse may lead to 
instability and impingement of the shoulder (Allegrucci et al. 1994,   McMaster 
et al. 1998, Pink & Tibone 2000, Weldon & Richardson 2001). In addition, a high 
shoulder range of motion can decrease stability of the glenohumeral joint, along 
with muscular imbalance, which has been suggested to be important factor in 
the development of an overuse injury (McMaster et al. 1998,  Weldon & 
Richardson 2001). However, a swimmer has to have a good flexibility to be able 
technically to perform the best movements in the water. Limitations in the 
range of motion may prevent a swimmer from swimming as efficiently as possible.  
Sein et al. (2010) found only a minimal association between laxity and 
shoulder impingement, but reported supraspinatus tendinopathy as a major 
cause of shoulder pain. However, Sein et al. (2010) found no association 
between swimming stroke and supraspinatus tendinopathy. In our study, only 
one-fourth of shoulder injuries was reported in the tendon; instead, more 
injuries were reported in the joint of the shoulder region. Because our study 
was conducted with a self-report questionnaire, the range of movements, exact 
diagnosis of the injury, the differences between tissue types and the specific 
location of e.g. tendon injuries could not be determined. In swimming and 
skiing, the upper extremities are predisposed to repetitive loading, but, 
interestingly, overuse injuries in the upper extremities were common only in 
swimmers and were sustained while swimming. This is probably related to the 
over-head movements in the water made by swimmers. The next most common 
overuse injuries in swimmers were located in the back and knee. Earlier studies 
have reported that overuse injuries in the above-mentioned sites are due to a 
62 
large amount of swimming training, especially in the butterfly and breastroke 
(Richardson 1987, Ferrell 1999, Rodeo 1999). A poor swimming posture in the 
water may also contribute to musculoskeletal back injury (Ferrell 1999). In our swimmers, unidentified pain was the most common type of acute back pain. Most of the swimmers’ acute injuries were minor, and hence it may be that they 
had not visited a physician and thus not had their injuries diagnosed.  
 
Long-distance running 
 One-year overall injury incidence among our long-distance runners was in line with those earlier reported for marathon runners (2.5 injuries/1000 exposure hours) by Lysholm & Wiklander (1987). However, Walter et al. (1989) found a 
greater incidence than we did. In the study by Walter et al. (1989), only 20 
percent of competitive runners, usually top-level athletes, had more injuries, 
and these were due to excessive training. In addition, fitness and recreational 
runners may have technical errors in running, which may predispose them to 
injury. In addition, in Walter et al. (1989), the injury rate was not counted per exposure hours. Instead, they gave the injury rate in athletes with at least one injury during the twelve-month follow-up as a percentage. Knobloch et al. 
(2008) reported an injury rate among running athletes of 0.08 per 1000 km 
exposure hours over six months. Comparison is difficult because we calculated the injury rate per 1000 exposure hours over a year. 
Long-distance running produces a regular pattern of repetitive impacts 
consisting of moderate ground-reaction-forces (van Mechelen 1992a, Crossley et 
al. 1999, Hreljac 2004). Earlier studies have shown that anatomical factors, training errors, long training distance per week and rapid impact forces may be reasons for running injuries (Lysholm & Wiklander 1987, Rolf 1995, Murphy et al. 2003, Hreljac 2004, van Gent et al. 2007, Messier et al. 2008). Both acute and overuse injuries were common in the lower extremities among our runners. Previously it has been reported that two-thirds of overuse injuries are located in 
the knee, lower leg and ankle in long-distance runners (van Mechelen 1992a, 
Taunton et al. 2002, Taunton et al. 2003, van Gent et al. 2007, Knobloch et al. 2008). Our results for runner’s injuries strengthen these findings, especially the predisposition of the foot to an overuse injury because of its repetitive loading 
while running. However, our runners had a high number of Achilles tendon 
injuries, as in the study by Knobloch et al. (2008). In agreement with our findings, Rolf (1995) and van Gent et al. (2007) also reported in their reviews that foot problems, including the Achilles tendon, were common in runners. Ankle injuries were also common in our study, as in Rolf (1995). However, van 
Gent et al. (2007) reported in their review that the ankle was a less common site 
of lower extremity injury.  A high risk for Achilles tendinopathy in former 
middle- and long-distance runners and tendon rupture in former sprinters 
(Kujala et al. 2005) and master track and field athletes (Kettunen et al. 2006) has been reported.   
 
63 
Soccer 
 
Soccer generates higher ground reaction forces, applied in different directions, 
during jumping, landing, starting and stopping compared to distance running 
(van Mechelen 1992a, Crossley et al. 1999, Hreljac 2004, Nikander 2005) and 
predisposes players to injuries. Our soccer players had a greater injury rate than skiers, swimmers or runners. Over five acute and overuse injuries (combined) occurred per 1000 exposure hours during one year. Söderman et al. (2001) 
found the same injury incidence per 1000 soccer hours.  In the study by 
Hägglund et al. (2003) the injury incidence was slightly greater. Two-thirds of the players´ injuries in our study were acute, also shown in earlier studies in both female (Engström et al. 1991, Faude et al. 2005,  Hägglund et al. 2009) and 
male players (Arnason et al. 2004, Hägglund et al. 2009).  
Beside quick movements and changes in running direction in the field, 
contact situations also increase the amount of injuries. Half of all the acute 
injuries in soccer occurred in matches. Our findings are in line with earlier 
reports, where 44%-58% of acute injuries have occurred during matches (Kujala et al. 1995b, Faude et al. 2005, Tegnander et al. 2008, Hägglund et al. 2009). In the other sports studied, acute injuries in competitions were rare. Half of our 
players’ acute injuries occurred in contact situations, for example during 
tackling situations. However, Engström et al. (1991) and Junge et al. (2004b) reported that on average 80% of acute injuries occurred, in physical contact with another player. Risk taking and aggressive behaviours may be one cause 
of injuries (Engström et al. 1991, Drawer & Fuller 2002). Some acute injuries 
could also be decreased by following the rules of the game in the field. In our study, in line with the study of Faude et al. (2006), strikers and defenders had at least one acute injury more often than players in the other playing position.  
A high incidence of acute injuries (over 80%) in the lower extremities has 
been reported both in elite female and male players (Engström et al. 1991, Arnason et al. 2004,  Faude et al. 2005,  Tegnander et al. 2008). Our players, too, 
most commonly had injuries in the lower extremities. Most of the acute injuries 
in our players were located in the ankle, knee and thigh, again in line with earlier studies (Söderman et al. 2001, Tegnander et al. 2008). The studies by Arnason et al. (2004) and Hägglund et al. (2009) reported the same trend as in 
our study concerning the location of acute injuries, except for ankle injuries, the 
incidence of which was four times lower than in our study. However, in the study by Arnason et al. (2004), injury data were collected prospectively throughout the competition season. Our study also concerned the training season. One-half of our players had at least one acute ligament strain or sprain 
while other common injury types were muscle injuries and contusions. These 
three types of injuries have also been found to be common in other studies 
(Arnason et al. 2004,   Hägglund et al. 2009). The overuse injuries of our players 
were located mainly in the back and the foot. However, groin injuries have been reported to be most common overuse injuries among soccer players (Arnason et 
al. 2004), especially among male players (Hägglund et al. 2009) . Only a few 
groin overuse injuries were reported by our female and male players. Because 
64 
we used a self-report questionnaire, it may be that groin injuries had not not 
been well identified among our athletes. Söderman et al. (2001) also reported 
that groin overuse injuries were rare in female soccer players.  
 
Severity of injuries 
 
Arnason et al. (2004) found 23% of injuries to be severe and time loss from 
training and competition in one season because of overall injuries to be over three weeks. Chomiak et al. (2000) and Tegnander et al. (2008) reported that 17% of soccer players’ injuries were severe and caused over four weeks time away from the sports. Hägglund et al. (2009) reported an even lower proportion 
of severe injuries (10%). In our soccer players the corresponding proportions of 
time lost of over three weeks and over four weeks were much higher for both 
acute and overuse injuries. The reason may be the high number of acute severe 
knee and ankle injuries, such as reported by Darrow et al. (2009). In the long-
distance runners, time loss was commonly due to overuse injuries of the foot, 
mainly in the Achilles tendon, causing nearly two months’ absence from 
training and competition. However, they did not terminate their sports career 
because of the Achilles tendon injury. Although swimmers and skiers had great 
number of injuries, long-term time loss was rare. This may be due the training 
program. Soccer players and runners tend mainly to train their own sports, 
soccer and running. If athletes have an injury in the lower extremities, their 
modified training and cross-training should be tailored individually to return 
them as soon as possible to full training and competitions. This is important to avoid loading the injured site and retain the athlete’s physical fitness despite the injury. Swimmers can usually continue modified swimming when they 
rehabilitate their lower extremities. Swimmers also tend to engage in other dry-
land cross-training exercises outside the pool, such as muscle training. Skiers 
also do a lot of training besides skiing, such as running and other endurance 
exercises, mainly because of lack of snow. These factors may explain swimmers 
and skiers short absences from training.  
 
Recurrent injuries 
 
We found a previous injury in the same anatomic location in nearly 40 percent 
of both acute injuries and overuse injuries when all sports were combined. As 
expected, recurrence of injuries was common in locations where the incidence of new injuries is common. This knowledge is important when rehabilitating injuries in these locations. Recurrent injuries were especially common in swimmers and rarest in soccer players. Previously, the proportion of recurrent 
injuries in soccer during three seasons has been reported to be over 20% 
(Hawkins & Fuller 1999). In our study, the proportion in soccer players was 
nearly 30% and acute recurrent injury was more common than recurrent 
overuse injury. The difference may be partly explained by methodological 
differences between the studies. Swenson et al. (2009) found, as we did, that 
ligament sprains were the most common type of recurrent injury. Many studies 
65 
on athletes and previous injury as a risk factor for a recurrent injury have been 
published (Walter et al. 1989, Dvorak et al. 2000, Taunton et al. 2003, Arnason et 
al. 2004, Croisier 2004,  Faude et al. 2006,   Hägglund et al. 2006, Wen 2007).  
Almost twice as many of our long-distance runners reported a previous 
injury than runners in an earlier study (Marti et al. 1988). These differences may 
at least partly be explained by the possibility that training volume among the 
participants in Marti et al. (1988) may have been lower than in our study.  
Studies on cross-country skiing and recurrent injuries are lacking . Proper 
rehabilitation of the first injury and a good training program are needed to prevent recurrent injuries. Proprioceptive training seems to be necessary for 
both male and female athletes to reduce the risk of recurrent injuries 
(Hupperets et al. 2009), while limited evidence for a reduction in ankle sprain 
recurrences through exercises has also been shown (Handoll et al. 2001).  In 
addition, Zech et al. (2009) concluded in their systematic review that 
proprioceptive and neuromuscular interventions after knee and ankle joint 
injuries can be effective in the prevention of recurrent injuries and improving 
joint functionality. However, the small numbers of studies that have reported 
specific outcomes make the reliability of their conclusions uncertain.  
  
6.2 Gender differences in sports injuries  
  
More male than female athletes had at least one acute injury, and this was 
especially seen among soccer players. In addition, more male than female long-
distance runners had at least one overuse injury. However, we found no 
differences between gender and the number of acute or overuse injuries per 
1000 exposure hours. Only a few gender differences in the anatomical locations 
of injuries were found. The main difference was a greater number of overuse 
injuries in the posterior thigh in male than female athletes, whereas females had 
a greater risk for overuse injuries to the ankle. The risk for such injuries remained after adjustment for sports. Overall, a higher proportion of female soccer players had more combined acute and overuse injuries in the ankle and knee than male players. Among the different sports, female long-distance 
runners reported more menstrual irregularities than the women in the other 
sports. However, it was only among skiers that women with irregular menses had more overuse injuries than skiers with regular menses.   
Male athletes have been reported to be at increased acute injury or overall 
injury risk compared to female athletes (Kujala et al. 1995b, Junge et al. 2004b,   
Knowles et al. 2006a, Darrow et al. 2009, Hägglund et al. 2009). In contrast, Elias 
(2001) showed greater aggregate injury in female than male soccer players, and 
Powell and Barber-Foss (2000) reported more acute injuries in girls than boys in high school sports. Increased injury risk in female swimmers (Sallis et al. 2001) and high-school cross-country runners (Rauh et al. 2000, Tenforde et al. 2011) compared to males has been reported, while Sandelin et al. (1980) found that 
66 
male cross-country skiers had more acute injuries than female skiers. Also, no 
gender differences in injury rates have been found among swimmers (Wolf et 
al. 2009). Overall, in accordance with our findings, earlier studies have found no gender differences in overall injury incidence in different sports after adjustment for exposure time (Lanese et al. 1990, Messina et al. 1999, Wolf et al. 
2009). It seems that possible gender differences in the proportion of injuries 
may partly be explained by differences in exposure time.  
In a review, van Gent et al. (2007) reported that the overall injury rate in 
the lower extremities was similar in female and male runners, and the same finding has been reported for cross-country skiers (Sandelin et al. 1980,  Orava 
et al. 1985, Smith et al. 1996) and soccer players (Hägglund et al. 2009, Ekstrand 
et al. 2011). Acute injuries in the lower extremities were common in our athletes 
and no gender differences were found. In addition, an equal number of overuse 
injuries of the lower limbs was found between males and females. In contrast to 
Satterthwaite et al. (1999) and Sallis et al. (2001), we found no difference 
between gender and different sports groups in injuries of the calf or hip.  
Hamstring strains are common injuries in sports characterized by maximal 
sprinting, kicking and sudden acceleration (Lysholm & Wiklander 1987,  Kujala et al. 1997, Bahr & Holme 2003, Croisier 2004, Hägglund et al. 2009, Ekstrand et al. 2011). Waldén et al. (2005) reported that acute thigh injuries in soccer players were the most common injury, causing a great amount of lost training and 
competition time. There is evidence to show that previous hamstring strains 
and age (Arnason et al. 2004, Hägglund et al. 2006, Engebretsen et al. 2010) are 
independent risk factors for new hamstring strains.  Thigh injuries may partly 
be explained by muscle fatigue, high training intensities, insufficient warm-up 
and hamstring tightness (Kujala et al. 1997, Bahr & Holme 2003, Croisier 2004), 
but the evidence for this is less convincing (Bahr & Holme 2003, Arnason et al. 
2004).  In some cases, where the size of the team is low, many players may be 
injured at the same time. The consequent high amount of playing time per player may increase the risk for thigh injuries, and the risk for overall injuries. In our study there was no gender difference in acute thigh injuries. However, a higher proportion of our male than female athletes had overuse injuries in the 
posterior thigh, which is in line with the findings of earlier studies 
(Satterthwaite et al. 1999, Sallis et al. 2001) and clinical experience.  
Hosea et al. (2000) found in ballplayers that females had greater overall 
risk for ankle injury than males. In our study females had a three-fold greater 
risk than males for overuse injury in the ankle. Higher joint laxity in females 
may contribute to this finding. Our female soccer players had slightly more 
acute ankle injuries than males. Moreover, women had more overuse injuries in 
the ankle and slightly more overuse injuries in the wrist than men. Methods 
such as use of insoles, external joint supports and multi-intervention training 
programs, have been proposed to prevent injuries in these anatomical locations 
(Parkkari et al. 2001, Aaltonen et al. 2007, Pasanen et al. 2008). Pasanen et al. 
(2008) concluded that a neuromuscular training programme is effective in 
preventing acute non-contact leg injuries in female floorball players. Because in 
67 
our study the incidence of ankle injuries was greater in female than in male 
athletes, it is especially important for the female athletes to have proper 
rehabilitation after injury to prevent recurrence of the ankle injury. 
Earlier studies have found more knee injuries, especially ACL injuries, 
among women than men (Arendt & Dick 1995,  Messina et al. 1999,  de Loës et 
al. 2000, Malinzak et al. 2001, Dugan 2005, Hägglund et al. 2009, Waldén et al. 
2011a). An ACL injury was reported in six cases of which five were women. Due to the low number of these injuries, we lacked the statistical power to investigate this in more detail. Overall, we found a similar number of knee injuries in men and women in all four sports. Haapasalo et al. (2007) also found 
no gender differences in overall knee injury risk, except in endurance sports.  
Female soccer players at the time of such an injury have been found to be 
younger than male players (Bjordal et al. 1997). During the present one-year 
retrospective study only one male soccer player suffered from an ACL injury, 
but no age differences were found between the female soccer players who had 
an ACL injury (22 y) and those who did not (21 y, p=0.53). When acute and 
overuse injuries in the ankle and knee were combined, female soccer players 
had more such injuries than male players, as has also been found in earlier studies, for both the ankle (Hosea et al. 2000, Elias 2001) and knee (Arendt & Dick 1995, de Loës et al. 2000, Dugan 2005, Hägglund et al. 2009) separately. 
In line with earlier studies (McMaster & Troup 1993, Wolf et al. 2009, Sein 
et al. 2010) on elite swimmers, our swimmers’ overuse injuries occurred mostly 
in the shoulder region without gender differences. Both acute and overuse 
injuries in the upper back in our female swimmers were rare. Sallis et al. (2001) 
reported that female swimmers had more injuries in the shoulder and 
back/neck region than male swimmers. They discussed the possibility that the 
difference between genders in these injuries may be due differences in training 
intensity. However, in our study there were no gender differences in exposure 
hours during the past twelve months.  
Female sex has been found to be a risk factor for stress fractures in the 
military population (Mattila et al. 2007), but this finding is less apparent in athletic studies (Snyder et al. 2006, Laker et al. 2007). Iwamoto and Takeda 
(2003) concluded in their review that male athletes tend to have more stress 
fractures than female athletes. The findings on female sex are inconsistent, as 
Bennell et al. (1996) and Kelsey et al. (2007) found an association between 
menstrual disturbances and stress fractures among runners, but Sandelin et al. 
(1980) found no association when studying cross-country skiers.
 Every fourth 
female athlete have been reported to have menstrual irregularities (Torstveit & 
Sundgot-Borgen 2005, Nichols et al. 2006) and these have been more common in 
long-distance runners, ballet dancers and gymnasts than in swimmers (Burrows 
& Bird 2000, Nichols et al. 2006). Tenforde et al. (2011) found no association 
between previous injury and menstrual irregularities among high school 
runners. Our long-distance runners also had significantly more menstrual 
irregularities than soccer players and swimmers. However, we did not find any 
association between stress fractures and menstrual irregularities. We also 
68 
studied the association between menstrual irregularities and the number of 
injuries, and after adjustment for exposure hours, we found no association.  
We found no great differences between male and female athletes and their 
sports injuries.  
/g3 
6.3 Risk factors for overuse injuries among endurance athletes 
  
We studied three endurance sports and their risk factors for overuse injuries. In general, on average, athletes with an overuse injury were one year older than athletes without such an injury; especially this was seen among the long-
distance runners. Athletes with less than two weekly resting and recovery days 
in the training season had over five-fold greater risk for an injury. Athletes who had more than 700 annual exposure hours had a two-fold greater risk for an injury.  
The role of age as a risk factor for injuries is controversial. Some studies of 
running or cross-country skiing have shown that injury risk is independent of 
age (Lysholm & Wiklander 1987, Marti et al. 1988, Tenforde et al. 2011). 
Sandelin et al. (1980) found male skiers under 30 years to have more injuries 
than older skiers, and Marti et al. (1988) concluded that with increasing age the incidence of running injury decreased. However, Engebretsen et al. (2010) reported that injured winter sports athletes did not differ in age from non-
injured athletes. One reason for this difference maybe because the study group 
consisted of athletes who participated in the Winter Olympic Games. It is possible that the athletes were rather similar in age. This was unlike our study, where the injured athletes were on average one year older than the non-injured athletes. 
Earlier studies have implicated  training volume, i.e. volume of running or 
higher weekly mileage, as a risk factor for injuries (Lysholm & Wiklander 1987, 
Marti et al. 1988, Wen 2007, Tenforde et al. 2011). In contrast, Hreljac et al. 
(2000) found no differences in distance run weekly between those who had 
never sustained an overuse lower limb injury attributed to running and those 
that had sustained at least one such overuse injury. Similarly, we found no 
association between injuries and number of kilometres run weekly, but a low 
number of weekly resting and recovery days and high number of training camp days were associated with higher risk for overuse injury. van Mechelen et al. (1996) found in their study of the general population that high exposure time was a risk factor for overall injury, which is in line with the report by Dvorak et 
al. (2000) among soccer players. Also, our endurance athletes with high number 
of annual exposure hours were at increased risk for an injury. In addition, a 
long history of active training years was a risk factor for an overuse injury. This 
is understandable in light of our study where older age was a risk factor for 
such an injury. We found also a tendency to an association between overuse 
injuries and long running experience.  
69 
Because tendon, joint and muscle overuse injuries were the most common types 
in our athletes, we concentrated on these injuries.  
 
Tendon injuries 
 Tendon injuries were especially common among long-distance runners with, typically, a low number of resting and recovery days from training. The runners with tendon injuries had on average more exposure hours per year than in the 
runners without such an injury. Our findings support the hypothesis that 
overuse injuries are partly caused by excessive training without enough resting and recovery time. However, number of kilometres run was not correlated with tendon injuries. An average of two resting and recovery days per week clearly 
reduced the risk of injury and there was a statistically non-significant trend that 
those athletes who had on average one resting and recovery day per week had 
15% lower risk of injuries compared to those with less than one resting and 
recovery day. A high number of active training years was associated with 
tendon injuries. Our athletes with tendon injuries were older than those without such injuries. Knobloch et al. (2008) also reported that runners with more than ten years experience had an increased risk for Achilles tendinopathy. 
As also in our study, Marti et al. (1988) reported that overuse injuries in the 
Achilles tendon were more common in older than younger runners. Age-related degeneration seems to play an important role in the etiology of tendon injuries (Kujala et al. 2005). To avoid injuries, adequate resting and recovery time 
between training sessions is important for all athletes who are training 
excessively with repetitive movements, and may be especially important for older athletes with a long training history, especially for athletes with an Achilles tendon injury. Repetitive loading of the tendon within the physiologic range leads to cumulative microtrauma, which may require days or weeks to fully self-repair (Khan et al. 1999). Rehabilitation with exercise alone was found to recover Achilles tendinopathy among the majority of the study group 
(Silbernagel et al. 2011). Every second athlete in our study with an Achilles 
tendon injury had suffered the same injury before.   Sein et al. (2010) found in swimmers that weekly mileage correlated significantly with tendonitis. Although there was no correlation between 
exposure hours during the year and tendon injury among our athletes, we 
found an association between fewer resting and recovery days per week in the training season and tendon injuries.   
Joint injuries 
 
High exposure time during the past year was associated with joint overuse 
injury among all athletes (gender- and sports-adjusted). A high amount of 
training may increase exposure to joint overuse injuries. A clear association was  
seen in the swimmers between the number of kilometres swum during the past 
year and an overuse joint injury. Nearly two-thirds of our swimmers’ joint 
injuries were located in the shoulder region, as has also been reported in earlier 
70 
studies (Richardson 1987, McMaster & Troup 1993, Johnson et al. 2003, Wolf et 
al. 2009).  
Among our athletes, those with a higher BMI were more prone to report a 
joint injury.  Messier et al. (2008) found no association between BMI and knee injury; however, injured athletes had higher body weight. This result may be 
due to loading being focused on the joints in running although it is a low-
impact sport, and may explain why, in our study, in every second runner with at least one joint injury the injury occurred in the knee. Athletes with a joint injury reported fewer competitions during the year than those without a joint injury. This may be explained by longer absences from sports because of a joint 
injury. Taunton et al. (2002) reported that female athletes with a BMI of less 
than 21 are at increased risk for spine injuries. However, our athletes with a 
BMI lower than 21 
 had more overuse injuries in the lower extremities, and only 
a trend towards an association between higher BMI and low back overuse 
injury was found. 
Ten percent of our skiers’ overuse injuries were joint injuries, which is less 
than reported previously by Orava et al. (1985). This may be due the different 
diagnostic methods used in these studies. We used a self-report questionnaire whereas Orava et al. (1985) gathered their study group from an injury clinic along with a precise diagnosis.  
 
Muscle injuries 
 
Muscle injuries have been reported to be common among cross-country skiers 
(Sandelin et al. 1980, Orava et al. 1985, Smith et al. 1996), as also found in our study. Every third cross-country skier reported a muscle injury in the low back. Earlier studies (Eriksson et al. 1996, Bahr et al. 2004) have reported such injuries to be more common when using the classic rather than skating technique, as was also found in our study. The back is loaded by repetitive extension, deep flexion and rotation movements in classic skiing, while in skating skiing the 
spine is held in a more stable and upright position (Eriksson et al. 1996, Bahr et 
al. 2004). In contrast, Butcher and Brennen (1998), found no correlation between different skiing techniques and low back injury or all injuries.  
Muscle injuries were also the most common type of injury in the shoulder 
region among swimmers. However, it may be that our self-report data does not 
differentiate reliably between injuries to tendon, joint or muscle.  
Every fourth muscle injury was in the shin or calf, especially in the skiers 
and runners. Shin and calf injuries have also been found to be common among skiers (Smith et al. 1996) and runners (Rauh et al. 2000, Knobloch et al. 2008). 
However, we did not find any training-related risk factors for muscle overuse 
injuries. 
 
  
71 
6.4 Sports career termination due to injury 
 
 
Based on our questionnaire study conducted at the end of the studied season, 
27 athletes (5% of the athletes who responded to the question) reported that 
they had ended their sports career because of an injury. More female than male 
athletes reported terminating their sports career. Among the different sports 
groups, swimmers were the most prone to end their career, and in all cases the 
reason was a shoulder injury. Controversially, Sein et al. (2010) reported that 
none of their sample of swimmers permanently discontinued swimming 
because of their shoulder problem. Because the swimmers in our study group 
were young, another common contributory reason for ending their sports career 
was to embark on study programs. All the soccer players who terminated were 
females with severe knee injuries. The present author interviewed by telephone 
20 of the 27 athletes who had reported ending their career, 7 to 11 months after 
the postal questionnaire. Five of these (25%) were continuing their sports career 
on the same level as earlier. Severe acute and overuse injuries to the large joints, 
shoulder and knee were the most common reasons for termination. Seventy 
percent of the athletes ending their career reported that injury caused them 
mild or moderate permanent disability in performing activities of daily life.  
Kettunen et al. (2001) found that 20% of former male athletes from 
different sports reported that an injury was the main reason for ending their athletic career. However, their follow-up was 15 years, much longer than in our 
study, and this long follow-up explains the larger number of athletes 
terminating because of injury.  In our study the interval between the postal 
questionnaire and interview was less than one year; this relatively short follow-
up may explain the low number of terminating athletes. Drawer and Fuller 
(2001) found in their study of male former soccer players that nearly half of the 
responders had ended their sports career because of an injury, most commonly 
an overuse injury. Their study group consisted of male soccer players. Most of 
the injuries in their study that led to early retirement from sports were knee injuries. In our study the reasons for ending the sports career originated equally from acute and overuse injuries, although in all the soccer players the reason was an acute knee injury. Overall, our findings are in line with the earlier view 
that injuries play a significant role in the decision to terminate a sports career, 
and in some specific sports injuries may commonly be the main reason.   
Although a high number of sports injuries occur in different sports each 
year, such injuries are not usually severe (Kujala et al. 2003b). Severe injury 
rates and patterns vary by sport, gender, and type of exposure (Darrow et al. 
2009), and can also mean considerable loss of training and competition time 
(Hägglund et al. 2006). Our athletes who ended their career had significantly 
more injuries per 1000 exposure hours than those who continued with the sports. On average they lost over four months’ training and competition time during the past twelve months. Long absence from a regular exercise program because of severe injuries may be frustrating for an athlete. Based on the 
72 
reported exposure hours, the injured athletes had continued to train despite 
their injuries, but they had fewer competitions and training camp days than the 
athletes who continued with their sports. It might be worthwhile to focus more specifically on athletes who are physically active but spend long periods away from competitions and hard training and are at risk for ending their sports 
career, in order to reduce that risk. It is important to plan proper rehabilitation 
programs or overall training methods which would improve the healing process.  
ACL injuries are usually severe and time loss because of such an injury 
can be long (Faude et al. 2005,  Jacobson & Tegner 2007). Söderman et al. (2002) 
reported that within 2-7 years of an ACL injury most of their sample of young 
female soccer players (78%) had stopped playing soccer, most commonly 
because of symptoms in their injured knee. Among our career-ending athletes 
all the ACL injuries occurred to female soccer players. Two of them had an ACL 
injury in both knees and three out of five athletes had undergone a knee 
operation because of such an injury. However, it has been reported that it is 
possible to return to elite sports within a year following ACL reconstruction 
with appropriate rehabilitation (Waldén et al. 2011a). Most of our career-ending athletes with a knee injury had pain and disability in squatting, while jumping was also difficult for them. Despite their injuries and symptoms, most of the athletes continued at least to engage in regular leisure-time physical activity 
after ending their sports career. However, severe injuries with extended loss of 
time from training may negatively affect an athlete’s motivation to rehabilitate 
himself/herself for a return to elite sports. This may be one of the reasons for 
the decision to stop his/her sports career. Ending their sports career is a matter 
of considerable importance for athletes and may possibly hamper their 
participation in leisure physical activity in later life (Kujala et al. 2003b). 
However, if we consider health from the viewpoint of an athlete’s later years, it 
may be that in the case of some sports injuries the decision to end a sports career is preferable to rehabilitation. This is worth remembering, as e.g. sports-related increased risk for knee osteoarthritis has been explained by knee injuries (Kujala et al. 2003a, Thelin et al. 2006). Also in this connection it is important for 
the athlete to know what he/she can do to reduce the risk of injury.  One of the 
most crucial issues is to find and deploy methods of preventing severe injuries 
that may terminate an athlete’s career.  The proper care and rehabilitation of 
injured athletes is therefore essential.  
In all the sports groups in this study, the athletes who terminated their 
career were somewhat older than those who continued, and career-ending 
athletes had more acute and overuse injuries that those who continued their 
career. The different loading patterns characteristic of the different sports were 
also associated with the injuries sustained: swimmers had shoulder region 
injuries, soccer players’ knee region injuries, and long-distance runners and 
cross-country skiers lower extremity injuries; the latter were mainly overuse 
injuries such as stress fractures. It seems that older athletes with sports-specific 
injuries are at increased risk for terminating their career. 
73 
The impact of an athletic injury is dependent on a number of factors such as the 
nature and severity of the injury and the importance of sports in the athlete’s 
life. Fear of re-injury and fear of movement of the injured anatomical site are important psychological factors for athletes not returning to sports, especially after a severe injury (Kvist et al. 2005, Chmielewski et al. 2008,  Silbernagel et al. 
2011). Athletes who reported a career-ending injury expressed significantly 
lower levels of life satisfaction than their non-injured counterparts (Kleiber & Brock 1992). However, Perna et al. (1999) concluded that athletes with a severe athletic injury were no less satisfied with their lives than non-injured or moderately injured athletes. Many athletes have found that they are unable to 
return to their previous physical activity level (Nyland et al. 2002), and are 
therefore dissatisfied. In this study we did not investigate the effects of injury 
on self-esteem or life satisfaction. However, many athletes reported decreased 
motivation as one important reason alongside their injury. It may be that 
gender and other factors such as embarking on further education may influence 
the decision to terminate a career in sports. /g3

6.5 Clinical implications and need for future research 
  
 
Cross-country skiing is a safe sport with a low acute and overuse injury rate. 
However, excessive training (over 700 h/yr) predisposes to a two-fold higher risk, and less than two days weekly resting and recovery time predisposes to a five-fold higher risk, for overuse injuries in endurance athletes. Severe injuries such an overuse injuries in the foot, especially in the Achilles tendon and ACL 
injuries in the knee, cause extended loss from training and competition, 
especially in long-distance runners and soccer players. All swimmers ending their sports career suffered from a shoulder-region injury and soccer players from an ACL injury. 
 Training programs should be tailored individually for each athlete. It is 
also important to ensure a healthy relationship between vigorous training and 
resting and recovery time after training, and allow the tissues an appropriate 
length of recovery time. It is also necessary for athletes and their coaches to know and understand how to modify training after injury - such as what can be done and what should be taken into account. The proper care and rehabilitation of an athlete with an injury is essential to prevent the recurrence of injuries.  
However, if we consider health in the athlete’s later years, it may be better to 
end a sports career after certain kinds of injuries than try to rehabilitate so as to continue in top-level sports. Notwithstanding, one of the most important things is to find out and use preventive methods to avoid severe and recurrent 
injuries, which may complicate the athlete’s life and even lead to termination of 
the athlete’s sports career.  
In our study, no severe permanent disabilities occurred due to injury. 
However, minor and moderate disability was reported among career-ending 
74 
athletes. Clearly, more prospective follow-up studies are needed to study 
injuries in sports the different loading patterns to obtain more specific 
information about injury etiology and mechanisms. In addition, intervention studies with different training programs are needed to clarify what kind of training would be effective in preventing injuries.

7 MAIN FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS 
 
 
Based on this retrospective twelve-month study, we conclude that:  
1. Top-level soccer players more commonly had acute injuries than cross-
country skiers, swimmers or long-distance runners. In soccer, half of all 
acute injuries occurred during matches. Also, half of all acute injuries 
occurred in contact situations. In soccer and cross-country skiing, the most 
common acute injury was an ankle injury. Among runners, the most acute 
injuries were in the foot and among swimmers in the back. 
 
2. Almost every second athlete had at least one overuse injury during the 
twelve-month follow-up. The highest prevalence of overuse injuries was 
found among long-distance runners. The most common location of an 
overuse injury correlated with the most loaded anatomical structure, such 
as shoulder injuries among swimmers, foot injuries among long-distance 
runners, and ankle injuries among soccer players and skiers. 
 
3. In cross-country skiers, both acute and overuse injuries occurred mainly in 
an event other than their own. Among swimmers, acute injuries occurred 
mainly in non-swimming exercises, whereas their overuse injuries 
occurred were mainly swimming-related.  
 
4. Male athletes more commonly had at least one acute injury than female 
athletes, especially among soccer players. Male long-distance runners also 
had a higher prevalence of at least one overuse injury than female runners. 
However, the other gender differences found were quite small: male 
athletes more commonly had posterior thigh overuse injuries and female 
athletes more commonly had ankle overuse injuries. Muscle injuries were more prevalent in male than female athletes, whereas ligament injuries were more common among female athletes.  
 
76 
5. Vigorous training during a year (over 700 hours/year) was a risk factor for 
an overuse injury among endurance athletes. Older athletes with less 
weekly resting and recovery time during the training season more 
commonly had at least one overuse injury. Older athletes also more 
commonly reported a tendon injury. Joint injuries occurred more often in 
the athletes, who’s BMI was greater.   
 
6. The older athletes with sports-specific injuries were at increased risk for 
terminating their career. Athletes who had terminated their sports career 
reported severe injuries, such as ACL injuries among female soccer 
players, with extended loss of time from training and competitions. All the 
swimmers who ended their career suffered from a shoulder injury. Most 
of the athletes who terminated their career because of injury had mild or 
moderate permanent disability. However, all the athletes who had ended 
their career were still physically active. 
 
In conclusion, cross-country skiing is a safe sport with low injury risk, and can 
be recommended not only to top-level athletes but also to other physically 
active people. Vigorous athletic training without enough resting and recovery 
time may predispose an athlete to risk for an injury, especially an overuse 
injury.

8. YHTEENVETO 
 
 
Tutkimuksen tarkoituksena oli kartoittaa eri tavalla kuormittavien urheilulajien 
vammaprofiilia suomalaisilla huippu-urheilijoilla kyselyä edeltäneen vuoden aikana. Kyselylomake lähetettiin vuonna 2006 kilpailukauden jälkeen hiihtäjille (n=300), uimareille (n=268), kestävyysjuoksijoille (n=265) ja jalkapalloilijoille 
(n=367). Tutkimusryhmä muodostui kauden 2005 lopussa ranking-listan 
kärjessä olleista 15-35 -vuotiaista mies- ja naisurheilijoista.  Kyselyyn vastasi 149 hiihtäjää, 154 uimaria, 143 kestävyysjuoksijaa ja 128 jalkapalloilijaa. Vastausprosentti oli 53%. Kysymykset koskivat mm. urheilijoiden 
harjoitteluhistoriaa, äkillisten vammojen ja rasitusvammojen määrää, 
anatomista sijaintia, vammatyyppiä sekä vammoista aiheutuneita poissaoloja 
harjoittelusta ja kilpailuista. Tarkemmin tarkasteltiin sukupuolten välisiä 
vammaeroja ja kestävyysurheilijoiden rasitusvammojen riskitekijöitä.  
 Jalkapalloilijoista 73%:lla oli vähintään yksi äkillinen vamma kyselyä 
edeltäneen vuoden aikana ja puolet kaikista äkillisistä vammoista tuli ottelun 
aikana. Keskimäärin joka kolmannella kestävyysurheilijalla oli ollut vähintään 
yksi äkillinen vamma. Nilkkavammoja oli kaikista äkillisistä vammoista 
yleisimmin hiihtäjillä (25%) ja jalkapalloilijoilla (24%). Jalkapalloilijoilla seuraavaksi yleisimmät vammakohdat olivat polvi (21%) ja reisi (17%).  Hiihtäjien toiseksi yleisin äkillinen vamma kohdistui selän alueelle (17%). 
Juoksijoiden kaikista äkillisistä vammoista 24% esiintyi jalkaterän alueella ja 
joka viidennellä vammautuneella juoksijalla oli polvivamma (22%). Uimareiden 
yleisimmät äkilliset vammat jakautuivat tasaisesti selän (18%), polven (17%) ja 
olkapään alueille (16%). Yleisimmin vammat olivat lihaskramppeja tai 
lihasrepeämiä sekä nivelsiteiden venähdyksiä. Kahdeksankymmentä prosenttia 
hiihtäjien ja 60% uimareiden äkillisistä vammoista sattui pääosin muissa lajeissa 
kuin urheilijoiden päälajissa.  
Keskimäärin joka toisella urheilijalla esiintyi vähintään yksi rasitusvamma 
kyselyä edeltävän vuoden aikana. Rasitusvammoja oli eniten 
kestävyysjuoksijoilla (59%) ja vähiten jalkapalloilijoilla (42%). Juoksijoiden 
yleisimmät rasitusvammat esiintyivät jalkaterän alueella sisältäen 
akillesjännevammat (41%) ja polvessa (16%). Myös jalkapalloilijoilla (28%)  ja 
78 
hiihtäjillä (22%) yleisimmät rasitusvammat kohdistuivat jalkaterän alueelle. 
Suurin osa uimareiden rasitusvammoista syntyi uinnissa ja yli puolet 
uimareiden rasitusvammoista esiintyi olkapään alueella. Hiihtäjät eivät juuri lainkaan raportoineet olkapään seudun vammoja, vaikka myös hiihdossa kuormitetaan yläraajoja ja olkapään aluetta. Yleisimmät rasitusvammat 
urheilijoilla oli jänteissä ja lihaksissa.  
Jalkapalloilijoiden äkilliset vammat aiheuttivat keskimäärin lähes kahden 
kuukauden poissaolon harjoittelusta ja otteluista. Juoksijoilla poissaolot olivat lyhyemmät kuin jalkapalloilijoilla, mutta silti keskimäärin 1,5 kuukautta. Rasitusvammojen takia juoksijat (53 pv/vuosi) olivat hieman enemmän poissa 
harjoittelusta ja kilpailuista kuin jalkapalloilijat (48 pv/vuosi). Vaikka hiihtäjillä 
ja uimareilla oli myös paljon rasitusvammoja, poissaolot harjoittelusta ja 
kilpailuista olivat vähäisempiä kuin juoksijoilla ja jalkapalloilijoilla. Tämä voi 
johtua juoksijoiden ja jalkapalloilijoiden vaikeammista vammoista mm. 
polvessa ja nilkassa. Lähes 40% kaikista vammoista oli uusiutuneita vammoja. 
Vammojen esiintyvyydessä ei ollut suuria eroja sukupuolten välillä. 
Miehillä oli useammin vähintään yksi äkillinen vamma vuoden aikana kuin 
naisilla. Vähintään yhden rasitusvamman esiintyminen oli miesjuoksijoilla yleisempää kuin naisjuoksijoilla. Naisilla oli enemmän nivelsidevammoja kuin miehillä, kun taas miehillä oli enemmän äkillisiä lihasvammoja. Äkillisen nilkkavamman ilmaantuvuus 1000 harjoittelu- ja kilpailutuntia kohden oli 
naisilla kaksinkertainen miehiin verrattuna, vastaavasti miehillä oli lähes 
kuusinkertainen riski saada reiden takaosan rasitusvamma. Naisilla puolestaan 
oli kolminkertainen riski saada nilkan rasitusvamma miehiin verrattuna. 
Rasitusvammoihin liittyviä riskitekijöitä kartoitettiin hiihtäjillä, uimareilla 
ja kestävyysjuoksijoilla . Vanhemmilla urheilijoilla oli suurempi riski saada 
rasitusvamma kuin nuoremmilla. Urheilijoilla oli yli viisinkertainen riski saada 
rasitusvamma, jos lepopäiviä harjoittelukauden aikana oli alle kaksi päivää 
viikossa. Kun tarkasteltiin harjoittelu- ja kilpailutunteja vuoden aikana, yli 700 tuntia vuodessa harjoitelleilla urheilijoilla oli kaksinkertainen riski saada rasitusvamma kuin alle 700 tuntia harjoitelleilla. Jännevammoja esiintyi yleisimmin urheilijoilla, jotka olivat vanhempia ja pitivät vähemmän 
viikoittaisia lepopäiviä harjoittelukauden aikana. Niveleen kohdistuvat 
rasitusvammat olivat yleisempiä urheilijoilla, joiden kehon painoindeksi  oli 
suurempi kuin 21.  
Tutkimusryhmästä 9% ilmoitti lopettaneensa urheilu-uransa kyselyä 
edeltäneen vuoden aikana ja heistä puolet vamman vuoksi. Yli 70% urheilu-
uransa lopettaneista urheilijoista raportoi vamman haittaavan toimintakykyä. 
Keväällä 2007 haastateltiin puhelimitse urheilu-uransa vamman vuoksi 
lopettaneita urheilijoita. Kahdestakymmenestä urheilijasta 15 oli lopettanut 
huippu-urheilu-uransa, yksitoista kilpaurheilun kokonaan ja neljä oli siirtynyt 
alemmalle kilpailutasolle. Neljännes urheilijoista kuntoutui vammastaan ja he 
jatkoivat aiemmalla kilpailutasolla. Kaikki uransa lopettaneet jalkapalloilijat 
olivat naisia ja heistä jokaisella oli polven eturistisiderepeämä. Kaikilla urheilu-
uran lopettaneilla uimareilla oli vamma olkapään alueella. Alentunut 
79 
motivaatio huipputasolla urheiluun oli vamman lisäksi tärkein syy urheilu-
uran lopettamiseen. Kaikki jatkoivat liikuntaharrastustaan, nyt vain 
pienemmällä teholla ja määrällä.  
Johtopäätöksenä voidaan todeta, että maastohiihto on vähäisen 
vammariskin vuoksi turvallinen urheilulaji ja sitä voidaankin suositella huippu-
urheilijoiden lisäksi myös kuntoilijoille. Hyvin kuormittava harjoittelu ilman 
riittävää lepoa voi altistaa erityisesti rasitusvammoille kestävyyslajeissa.

 SPORTS INJURY STUDY
 
 The purpose of this questionnaire is to gather information about sports injuries, their incidence, how they have occurred and other related data. Read the questions carefully 
and circulate the alternatives that best apply to your own situation or write the answer in 
the space provided. If necessary, you can exceed the space allocated.

This section focused on the contribution of sports injuries to the termination ending of 
your sports career. Please read the following paragraph carefully before answering.  
 In this study terminating a sports career means no longer continuing the career on the 
level at which you have been training and actively competing. A sports career is also 
considered terminated where the athlete has continued to participate in the same sports 
but at a lower level (less targeted), or whether the athlete  had changed his or her event .

1.Transient mild disability : The disability in itself did not compel you to quit the 
sport, but it contributed to your decision to terminate. You still had the choice of continuing in sport as before. You are able to continue in sports at a lower level or in different sports. 
 
2.Transient severe trauma:  You no longer compete at the same level as prior to your 
injury, but you are able to continue in sport at a lower level or in different sports. The trauma no longer causes symptoms. 
 
3.Mild permanent disability:  You no longer compete at the same level as prior to your 
injury, but you are able to continue in sport at a lower level or in a different event.  Use of the injured area may cause symptoms, but the symptoms do not interfere with your everyday life. 
 
4.Moderate permanent disability : You are unable to continue the sports. You are able 
to perform light and normal physical activities of daily living, but use on the injured site causes symptoms which disrupt your daily life.

Accepted for publication 2 March 2009
This 12-month retrospective questionnaire compared the
occurrence of sports injuries in 149 cross country skiers,
154 swimmers, 143 long-distance runners and 128 soccer
players aged 15–35 years. Soccer had signiﬁcantly more
injuries (5.1 injuries/1000 exposure hour) than other sports
(2.1–2.8, Po0.001). More runners than soccer players
reported overuse injuries (59% vs 42%, P50.005), locating
typically in the foot in runners, soccer players and skiers.
Swimmers reported overuse injuries in the shoulder more
commonly than skiers (40% vs 1%, Po0.001), who also
intensively load shoulders. Acute injuries in skiers (80%) andin swimmers (58%), and overuse injuries in skiers (61%),
occurred during exercise other than own event. In soccer and
running the absence time from sport because of injuries was
signiﬁcantly longer than in skiing and swimming. No severe
permanent disabilities occurred due to injury but seven
women quit sports because of injury. In conclusion, type of
loading is strictly associated with the anatomical location of
an overuse injury as shown by the diﬀerence in shoulder injury
incidence between swimmers and cross country skiers. In
some sports, a signiﬁcant proportion of acute injuries occur in
other than the main event.
Numerous injuries caused by sport occur each year,
resulting in breaks from activity, disability and con-siderable medical costs (Requa et al., 1993; Center
for Disease Control and Prevention, 2002; Connet al., 2003). Although a high number of sportinjuries occur in diﬀerent sports, they are not usuallysevere (Kujala et al., 2003). Even then, injuries cancause time loss from training and competition (Ha ¨g-
glund et al., 2006), and subjects with a history of
previous injury are at an increased risk for new injury(Van Mechelen et al., 1996; Murphy et al., 2003;Ha¨gglund et al., 2006). Increased understanding of
the mechanisms by which injuries occur would be of
value both in the prevention of injuries and in
tailoring substitute exercises or rehabilitation pro-grams to meet the needs of injured individuals.
Diﬀerent loading patterns may cause dissimilar
injury proﬁles. Cross country skiing consists ofrepetitive pliant movements without impacts. Be-cause of its almost complete lack of ground-impact,combined with a great number of movements, swim-ming is considered to be a repetitive, non-impactloading sport (Nikander et al., 2005). In long-dis-tance running, the structures of the lower extremities
are exposed to a large number of repetitive impacts(van Mechelen, 1992; Hreljac, 2004). Soccer is a
typical impact sport, including rapidly acceleratingand decelerating movements (Nikander et al., 2005).Soccer is also a team sport involving physical contactwith other players.
Because athletes have several injuries, it is neces-
sary to know the injury proﬁle in a speciﬁc sport andhow injuries can be prevented. The occurrence of
injuries has been compared, using the same metho-
dology, in only a few, sporadic studies (Bahr et al.,2004). Moreover, most of the studies investigatingsport-related injuries have not studied acute andoveruse injuries separately. Therefore, the aim ofthis study was to compare the occurrence of acute
and overuse injuries, the role of previous injuries,
time loss from training and competition and in
addition, the reasons for stopping a career in athletes
in diﬀerent sports with diﬀering loading patterns.
Material and methods
Subjects
We recruited 1200 competitive Finnish top-level male and
female athletes (range 15–35 years) to this retrospective injury
study, representing four diﬀerent sports and loading modal-Scand J Med Sci Sports 2010: 20: 384–393

ities, after a competition season. They included cross country
skiers (repetitive loading to upper and lower extremities),swimmers (repetitive loading to upper extremities without
impact loads), long-distance runners (repetitive loading to
lower extremities) and soccer players (high risk for impactloads and sprains). A sport injury questionnaire was sent to300 top-ranking at the end of the previous season cross
country skiers, 268 swimmers, 265 long-distance runners and
367 soccer players (21 teams). The inclusion and exclusioncriteria used are shown in Fig. 1.
Questionnaire
The 12-month retrospective sport injury questionnaire was
mailed to the above-mentioned groups of athletes. The ques-
tionnaire included items on anthropometry, training history,training and competition volume as well as on acute and
overuse sport injuries during the past 12-month period. In
addition, questions were asked about injury location, date ofinjury, the type of exercise that caused the acute injury andinjury-related possible adverse eﬀects on sport performance.
The structural questionnaire also included details of the ﬁve
most severe acute and overuse injuries sustained during thepast 12 months. There was also a question asking whetherthere had been previous acute or overuse injuries in the same
anatomic location injured during the past 12 months. Absence
times because of acute and overuse injury from training orcompetition in the past 12 months were also inquired. The
questionnaire included separate items on training hours and
frequency per week during training and competition seasons
as well as on the training and the competition season length.
On the basis of these four questions, the total number of traininghours per year was calculated. Injury rates are reported as
number of injuries per 1000 exposure hours, i.e. any type of
exercise and competition hours combined. The injury rates were
calculated separately for acute, overuse and all injuries. The self-reported questionnaire data were validated and reliability-testedagainst interview data in 50 athletes from diﬀerent sports in a
week after ﬁlling the questionnaire (Karhula & Pakkanen, 2005;
Eloranta & Tittonen, 2006). In addition, to investigate thereasons for not responding, we sent a one-page questionnaireto long-distance runners (99 athletes) who did not respond to
our long questionnaire. The most commonly reported reason for
non-response was the length of the questionnaire.
The term acute injury was deﬁned as follows: an acute
sports injury occurs suddenly or accidentally, interrupting the
exercise or the competition of the athlete or causing anidentiﬁable trauma. An acute injury is any physical injurythat keeps the athlete away from at least one training session,
or competition, or needs a physician’s care. The term overuse
injury was deﬁned as follows: an injury causes pain duringexercise loading without any noticeable external cause ofinjury. The injury gradually causes worsening pain during or
after exercise. Pain becomes worse when loading is continued
and may stop exercise completely. Minor injury was deﬁned asQuestionnaire

time loss from training and competition from no time loss to 6
days and major injury as time loss from training and competi-
tion over 3 weeks. Time loss was deﬁned as the time athletes
were not able to participate in training or competition or theathlete needed medical care.
In addition, it was asked whether any injury during the past
12 months was the reason for quitting competitive sports. In
spring 2007, we also interviewed by phone with a structuralquestionnaire those athletes (19 of 27, 70.4%) who had reportedthat they had quit sports because of an injury (injury was either
the main reason or had an inﬂuence on the decision).
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS (version 13.0;
SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA). w2statistics, t-tests and
analysis of variance were applied to calculate statisticaldiﬀerences in distributions between the diﬀerent sports. A
statistically signiﬁcant threshold was accepted at P/C200.05,
two-tailed. In post hoc between-group comparisons the Bon-
ferroni correction was used.
Results
The response rate was 59% (639/1075). Of those
athletes who returned the questionnaire 6% (65/1075) refused to participate. The ﬁnal study groupconsisted of 574 elite athletes (149 cross country
skiers, 154 swimmers, 143 long-distance runners
and 128 soccer players) (Fig. 1). The subjects’ char-acteristics are shown in Table 1.
Individual sport athletes responded better than
soccer players and there was a variation in theresponse rates between soccer teams. The averageage of the athletes who answered and who did notwas the same. The response rate was higher in female
(65.6%) than in male (53.8%) athletes ( Po0.001).The numbers of subjects in each sport with acute
injuries are shown in Table 2. The number of subjectswith acute injuries was the highest in soccer (73%,Po0.001) compared with the other sports (28–32%).
The only statistically signiﬁcant group diﬀerence in
the occurrence of overuse injuries was between thelong-distance runners and the soccer players (59% vs42%, P50.005) (Table 2). The overall (acute and
overuse) incidence of injury can be seen in Table 2.
Among those athletes who had an acute injury,
a higher proportion of long-distance runners(90%) reported at least one acute injury in the
lower extremities compared with swimmers (61%,
P50.002) (Fig. 2a). Among those injured athletes,
acute injuries in the upper extremities were moreprevalent in the swimmers (45%) than cross countryskiers, (15%, P50.002), soccer players (12%,
Po0.001) or long-distance runners (2%, Po0.001).
The most typical location of acute injuries can beseen in Fig. 2a.
Swimmers reported overuse injuries in the
shoulder more commonly than cross country skiers(40% vs 1%, Po0.001). Among the athletes with an
overuse injury, long-distance runners (95%) hadmore overuse injuries in the lower extremities thanthe swimmers (33%, Po0.001), soccer players (78%,
P50.002) or cross country skiers (80%, P50.003)
(Fig. 2b). Among the long-distance runners who had
at least one overuse injury, every ﬁfth overuse injury
(n517/85) was located in the Achilles tendon. The
proportion of athletes with at least one overuseinjury (Fig. 2b) or all injuries by anatomical locationis shown in Fig. 2c.
Compared with soccer players (67%), acute inju-
ries during competitions were signiﬁcantly less com-mon in the cross country skiers (27%, Po0.001),

long-distance runners (15%, Po0.001) and swim-
mers (12%, Po0.001).
Of the acute injuries of the cross country skiers,
80% occurred in events other than skiing, and overone-third (35%) of their acute injuries occurred while
running. In the swimmers 58% and in the long-
distance runners 51% of the acute injuries occurredin events other than their own. Cross country skiers
reported 61% of all overuse injuries originating insport events other than cross country skiing, whereas
81% of the swimmers’ overuse injuries were sus-tained while swimming.
The number of acute injuries and the number of
previous injuries at the corresponding anatomical
location are shown in Table 3. In cross country skiersand in soccer players the most common anatomicalsite of the recurrent acute injury was the ankle, inswimmers it was the back and in runners it wasthe foot. In case of overuse injuries, the mostprevalent previous injury locations in skiers werethe knee and foot, in swimmers the shoulder region,
in runners it was the foot and in soccer players the
back (Table 3).
Among the injured athletes the average time of
non-attendance of training and competition duringthe past 12 months because of acute injury wassigniﬁcantly longer in the soccer players (56 days/
year) than that in the cross country skiers (17 days/year, P50.001) and in the swimmers (12 days/year,
Po0.001). The long-distance runners (44 days/year)
had more absence days than the cross country skiers
(P50.019) and the swimmers ( P50.004). Rather
similar trends were seen in the absence times becauseof overuse injury (Table 4). The acute and overuseinjuries together caused over a 3-month time loss oftraining and competition most commonly among thesoccer players (26% and 19%, respectively) and therunners (17% and 22%, respectively) (Table 4).
Fifty-two (9.1%) athletes, 40 female and 12 male
athletes ( P50.001) quit competitive sports during
the 12-month period. Seven (13.5%) of them re-ported that the main reason for ending the sportscareer was a sports injury, and all of them werewomen. Twenty of 28 athletes whose decision to quitsports was inﬂuenced by an injury reported that theinjury caused mild or moderate permanent disability.Among these athletes, three of four skiers reported
that the decision to quit a sports career was due to an
overuse injury, ﬁve of eight swimmers reported ashoulder injury and in soccer players six of sevenreported a knee injury as having an inﬂuence on thedecision to quit sports.Table 2. Injury rate of the different sport groups in past 12 month

Discussion
The most important ﬁndings of the present study
include that type of loading is strictly associated with
the anatomical location of an overuse injury and that
in some sports many injuries occur in sports other thanthe main event. The number of subjects with at leastone acute injury was the highest in the soccer players,and the incidence of overuse injuries was the highest inthe long-distance runners. Interestingly, among thecross country skiers both acute and overuse injuriesoccurred mainly in exercise other than their own event.
Moreover, acute injuries in the swimmers occurred
mainly when practising another sport, while overuseinjuries occurred mainly while swimming. Our 12-month retrospective study was designed to investigate
acute and overuse injuries among athletes in sportswith diﬀerent loading patterns.
The anatomic distributions of overuse injuries in
particular were inﬂuenced by the loading patterns of
the speciﬁc sports studied. Swimmers had acute and
overuse injuries in the shoulder region, and a highproportion of acute and overuse injuries were locatedin the lower extremities in cross country skiers, long-distance runners and soccer players. Among skiers
and runners, the main injury location was the kneeand the foot, including the Achilles tendon. Injuredlong-distance runners and soccer players were nearly
2 months absent from training because of acute or
overuse injuries. All those athletes who quit theirsport career due to an injury were women.
Expectedly, acute injuries were common in soccer.
Our ﬁnding that half of the acute injuries in soccerplayers occurred in matches is also in line with earlierﬁndings (Kujala et al., 1995; Tegnander et al., 2008).In the other sport groups, acute injuries in competi-
tions were rare.
The literature exhibits conﬂicting opinions regard-
ing the injury rate linked to the skating and classictechniques in cross country skiing (Butcher & Bran-nen, 1998; Bahr et al., 2004). In our study, overuseinjuries of the low back sustained in skiing were morefrequent when using the classic (59%) than theskating technique (12%) (results not shown in detail).
Only 20% of acute injuries were skiing injuries, and
two-third of the overuse injuries occurred whilepractising some sport other than skiing. This ﬁndingis in accordance with the study by Orava et al. (1985).

In previous studies, the occurrence of shoulder injury
over 1 year in swimmers varied from 26% to 35% (Bak& Magnusson, 1997; McMaster et al., 1998). A swim-mer performs more than one million strokes annuallywith each arm. Over 90% of the propulsive force comes
from the upper extremities (Richardson, 1987; Pink &Tibone, 2000). In both swimming and skiing, the upperextremities are predisposed to repetitive loading, but,

interestingly, overuse injuries in the upper extremities
were common only in swimmers and were sustained
while swimming. This is probably related to the over-
head movements performed by swimmers.The occurrence of injuries over 1 year among the
long-distance runners was 75% (overall injury),
which was somewhat greater than that found in
previous studies (48–57%) (Lysholm & Wiklander,Table 3. Recurrence of acute and overuse injuries in the same anatomical site in different sport

1987; Walter et al., 1989). But then, the number of
runners with knee injuries in our study was lowerthan has been reported earlier (van Mechelen, 1992;Duﬀey et al., 2000; van Gent et al., 2007). However,
runners had a high number of Achilles tendon
injuries, a ﬁnding that is supported by Rolf (1995).A high risk for Achilles tendinopathy and tendonrupture in former runners and master track and ﬁeldathletes has been reported (Kujala et al., 2005;Kettunen et al., 2006).
We found that there was a previous injury in the
same anatomic location in 36% of acute injuries and
38% of overuse injuries when all sports were combined.
Expectedly, recurrence of injuries was common inlocations where the incidence of new injuries is com-mon. This knowledge is important when rehabilitating
injuries in these locations. These recurrent injuries wereespecially common in swimmers and the rarest insoccer players. Previously, the proportion of recurrentinjuries in soccer during three seasons has been re-
ported to be over 20% (Hawkins & Fuller, 1999). In
our study, the amount was nearly 30%. The diﬀerencemay be partly explained by methodological diﬀerencesbetween the studies. Almost twice more of our long-distance runners reported a previous injury than in theprevious study by Marti et al. (1988). These diﬀerencesmay at least partly be explained by the fact that trainingvolume among participants in the study of Marti et al.
(1988) may have been lower than in our study.
Chomiak et al. (2000) and Tegnander et al. (2008)
reported in soccer players that 17% of injuries weresevere and require over 4 weeks of time loss from thesport. In our soccer players, the corresponding pro-portions were much higher for both acute (38%) andoveruse injuries (29%). This may be because of ahigh number of acute knee and ankle injuries with a
long time loss in our study. In long-distance runners,
time loss was common because of overuse tendoninjuries; mainly, the injuries were in the Achilles
tendon, causing nearly 2 months absence from train-
ing and competition. Although swimmers had a greatnumber of injuries, long-term time loss was rare.
In our soccer players, the knee injury was the most
common cause ending the sport career, especially in
women. According to the male Finnish former elite
athlete cohort (Kettunen et al., 2001), 20% reportedthat they had quit their sports career due to sportsinjury, and in a large case-series of Finnish athletesknee injury was the most common reason causingmild degree permanent disability (Kujala et al.,1995). In the present study, none of the athletes
reported severe permanent disability due to sports
injury but injuries caused mild disabilities and long
time losses from training and seven quit sports becauseof injury. This has high importance for athletes andmay possibly prevent participation in leisure physicalactivity in later life (Kujala et al., 2003).Sport-related injury risk has been reported in vary-
ing ways (van Mechelen, 1992; Hunter, 1999; Junge &Dvorak, 2000; Rauh et al., 2006), which makes itdiﬃcult to compare the results of diﬀerent studies.
For the most part, earlier studies have reported all
sport-related injuries but not separated acute fromoveruse injuries. With respect to their etiology andpossible means of prevention, diﬀerentiation betweenacute and overuse injuries would seem to be essential.It is clinically important that sports-speciﬁc analysesare performed to determine the risk factors for injuriest y p i c a lt oe a c hs p o r tt oh e l pi nt h e i rp r e v e n t i o n .
Knowledge from our study can be used in injury
prevention and in tailoring substitute training orrehabilitation programs to injured athletes.
The fairly low response rate in our study was
comparable to that in other retrospective epidemio-logical sport injury studies (Maﬀulli et al., 2005;Rauh et al., 2006). One explanation for the lowresponse rate may have been the length of our
questionnaire (42 pages) as reported by long-distance
runners in our short questionnaire to non-respon-ders. The fairly low response rate of the soccerplayers might be due to the fact that we sent thequestionnaire after the competition season when themembers of each team were resting from training andcompetition. Female athletes responded more ac-tively than male athletes. Overall, we did not ﬁnd
an association between the position in the ranking
list and the response rate. However, we do not haveexact knowledge on whether those who did notrespond had fewer injuries, but this possible selectionbias should be rather similar in all sports.
Outcomes may also be inﬂuenced by the method of
data collection. Walter and Hart (1990) reported thatretrospective surveys are less likely to provide accu-
rate incidence data because they rely on athletes’
responses and on diagnoses that lack veriﬁcation by aphysician. In our study, the self-reported question-naire data were validated and reliability-tested
against interview data, and were shown to be
accurate (Karhula & Pakkanen, 2005; Eloranta &Tittonen, 2006). In addition, elite athletes usuallykeep a training diary, which can be expected to
improve the accuracy of the questionnaire data
collection. Comparability between diﬀerent sportsshould not be a problem in our study as the methodapplied was the same for all the four sports studied.However, retrospective data collection is a limitationin our study. Also, the validation method we useddoes not exactly reveal the accuracy and coverage ofthe reported injuries, but was more adequate for
measuring the reproducibility/repeatability of the
data collection. Retrospective survey studies havetwo main categories of recall bias (Harel et al.,1994): a memory decay, which means the loss ofinformation due to failure to recall the event, and the

telescoping eﬀect, which is the tendency to remember
events in the past as if they occurred closer to thepresent than they actually did. Survey studies do notalways underestimate injury incidence, since some
common injuries may be overreported (Peterson
et al., 1993).
In conclusion, acute injuries among cross country
skiers and swimmers occurred mainly in sport otherthan their own event. Both swimmers and crosscountry skiers use the upper extremities and espe-cially shoulders, but shoulder injuries were lesscommon in cross country skiers compared with
swimmers. The number of acute injuries was high
in soccer players while overuse injuries were mostcommon among long-distance runners.
Perspectives
In addition to costs to health care, numerous injuries
caused by sport result in time loss from training andcompetition. Although injuries are not usually severefrom the medical point of view, their importance foractive athletes is high. Diﬀerent types of studies havebeen carried out to identify the injury proﬁles andtheir etiological background. However, rather littleepidemiological research is available diﬀerentiatingacute and over-use injuries and comparing diﬀerent
types of sport using the same methodology. Ourstudy shows that to understand the etiology of sportsinjuries and to ﬁnd out ways of preventing them,
acute and overuse injuries need to be diﬀerentiated in
the analyses. Acute injuries often occur in contactsituations and among endurance athletes in sportsother than their own sports event. Overuse injuryoccurrence is anatomically strictly linked to thespeciﬁc loading patterns of each sport. In our study,no severe permanent disabilities occurred due toinjury but seven women reported having quit sports
because of an injury, which area needs further
studies. The knowledge derived from our study canbe used in the prevention of injuries and in tailoringsubstitute training or rehabilitation programs tophysically active individuals.

Abstract  
This twelve months survey compared injury risk and injury 
types by genders (312 females, 262 males) in 15- to 35-year-old 
cross-country skiers, swimmers, long-distance runners and 
soccer players. More male than female athletes reported at least 
one acute injury (44% vs. 35%, p < 0.05), and more male than 
female runners reported at least one overuse injury (69% vs. 
51%, p < 0.05). When the incidence of acute and overuse inju-
ries both separately and combined was calculated per 1000 
training hours, per 1000 competition hours and all exposure 
hours combined we found no gender differences in either of 
these comparisons. After adjustment for sport event males were 
at increased risk for posterior thigh overuse injuries compared to 
females (relative risk (RR) 5.8, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3 
to 26.4, p < 0.05) while females were at increased risk for over-
use injuries in the ankle compared to males (RR 3.1, 95% CI 1.0 
to 9.3, p < 0.05). After adjustment for exposure time (inju-
ries/1000 exposure hours) significance of the difference between 
the sexes in overuse injury to the ankle persisted (female 0.11 
vs. male 0.02 injuries/1000 exposure hours, p < 0.05). Six ath-
letes had an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury, of whom 
four were female soccer players. After combining all reported 
acute and overuse ankle and knee injuries, the proportion of 
athletes with such injury was higher in the female compared to 
male soccer players (75% and 54% respectively; p < 0.05), but 
no difference was found in such injuries when calculated per 
1000 exposure hours. In conclusion, we found some gender differences in sport-related injuries, but most of these differ-
ences seemed to be explained at least in part by differences in 
the amount of training.   
 
Key words:  Male, female, athletic injuries, acute injury, over-
use injury. 
 
 
Introduction 
 
In general patterns of injuries in athletes have been as-
sumed to be more sport-specific than gender-specific. 
Presently, most sport injury studies that have investigated 
gender differences have focused exclusively on knee injuries (Arendt and Dick, 1995; Dugan, 2005). To date, 
only a few sport injury stud ies have compared acute in-
jury rates (Kujala et al., 1995) or overall injury rates (de Loes et al., 2000; Sallis et al., 2 001) between the sexes.  
Previous studies have found similar overall injury 
rates in men and women (Lanese et al., 1990; Sallis et al., 2001). In contrast some sports and recreation-related 
injury studies have shown male athletes to be at greater 
risk for injury than their fema le counterparts (Conn et al., 2003; Dempsey et al., 2005). Powell and Barber-Foss 
(2000) and Elias et al. (2001) have reported that female 
soccer players had a higher incidence of injury than males .  
Male athletes have been reported to have a higher 
risk for severe sport-related injuries than female athletes 
(Conn et al., 2003). Only a few studies have reported on 
gender differences in injuries related to cross-country 
skiing (Sandelin et al., 1980)  and swimming (McMaster 
and Troup, 1993).  
Specific to body location, females athletes have 
been reported to have more injuries to  the hip  (Sallis et 
al., 2001; Satterthwaite et al ., 1999), lower leg and shoul-
der than male athletes, while males had more injuries in 
the thigh than females (Sallis et al., 2001). In marathon 
runners Satterthwaite et al. (1999) noticed that males had 
greater risk for hamstring and calf injuries than female runners. de Loes et al. (2000) reported that overall risk for 
knee injury in 12 sports was significantly higher for fe-
males than males. Similarly Arend t and Dick (1995) 
found that knee injuries were more prevalent among fe-
male than male soccer players. 
Overall, the literature of gender differences in inju-
ries is limited. It is not known precisely whether the gen-
der differences found are sport-specific only and thus 
related to training behaviors, or whether the difference in 
risk is related to biolog ical gender differences.  
Our purpose was to study differences in sport-
related injuries between male and female elite athletes in 
four sports with different loading patterns. The sports 
were cross-country skiing, sw imming, long-distance run-
ning and soccer.  
 
Methods 
 
Subjects  
A questionnaire was sent to competitive top-ranking Fin-
nish female and male athletes (age 15 - 35 years) after each competitive season. Overall, 1200 questionnaires 
were distributed with the sa mple represented four differ-
ent sports and loading modalities for 300 cross-country 
skiers (repetitive loading to up per and lower extremities 
with pliant movements), 268 swimmers (repetitive load-
ing to upper extremities without impact loads), 265 long-distance runners (repetitive lo ading to lower extremities 
with moderate impact loads) and 367 (21 teams) soccer 
players (higher for imp act loads and sprains) Research article

The long-distance runners whose running di stance was from 1500m to marathon were 
included in to the study. After excluding participants over 35 years of age and soccer 
teams with a low response rate, the final study target group consisted of 1075 athletes 
(Ristolainen et al., in press, 2009). The study protocol wa s approved by the ethics com-
mittee of the University of Jyväskylä. 
 
Questionnaire 
The 12-month structural retrospectiv e sport injury questionn aire included items on an-
thropometry, training histor y, training and competition volume as well as on acute and 
overuse sport injuries during the past 12-month period. In addition, questions were asked 
about the anatomical location of the inju ry, type of injury and situation  in which the 
injury was sustained (in training or competition). Female athletes were also asked about 
if the menstruation had begun, and in what age they started, the regularity or irregularity 
of menstrual cycle (oligo- or  amenorrhea). The menstrual i rregularity was defined as 6 
menstruations or less per y ear or missing menstruation (Bennell and Alleyne, 2007). 
Also the number of menstrual cycles was aske d during the past 12 months.  The ques-
tionnaire has been previously validated against interview data (Eloranta and Tittonen, 2006; Karhula and Pakkanen, 2005). 
The term acute injury was defined as an injury that occurs suddenly or acciden-
tally, interrupting the athlete´s training or perform ing in a competition or causing an 
identifiable trauma. An acute injury was any physical injury which kept the athlete away from at least one training session, or co mpetition, or needed a physician’s care.  The 
term overuse injury was defined as an injury that causes pain during exercise loading without any noticeable external cause of injury. The injury gradually caused worsening 
pain during or after exercise.  The pain got wo rse when the load ing was continued and 
might cause the exercise to be stopped completely.  
 
Statistics 
The statistical analyses were done with the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences, 
version 15.0 (Norusis/SPSS, Inc., Chicago, Illinois). We calculated the results as abso-
lute injury rates, comparing between  the sexes. We then calcu lated injury rates as num-
ber of injuries per 1000 exposure hours i.e. ho urs spent on any type of training or on 
performing in competitions separately and combined. Injury rates were calculated sepa-
rately for acute, overuse and all injuries. /g548
2 statistics, t tests and analysis of variance 
(ANOVA) were applied to calculate statistical differences in gender distributions and between sports. Poisson regression was used to calculate the injury risk, adjusted for 
sport event, between the sexes.

female players (p < 0.05).  
 
response rate was 48%.  To investigate the reasons for not responding we sent one-page questionnaire to long-d istance runners (99 ath letes) who did not respond to our long 
questionnaire. The most common reported reason for non-respon se was the length of the 
questionnaire. Females reported less training (566 hours/year [h/yr]) during the past twelve months than males (636 h/yr, p < 0.05). The athletes reported on average 16.2 
competition hours per year (female: 14.8 and male: 17.9, p = 0.08) for the whole sample.  
The average number of competition hours varied by sport because of different duration 
of competitions i.e. in swimmers vs. so ccer players. Detailed sex-specific, anthropomet-
ric and training and competition inform ation are shown in Table 1. 
 
Acute injuries 
Two hundred and twen ty-five athletes (39%) reported 432 acute injuries. More male 
than female athletes reported an acute injury (44% vs. 35%, p < 0.05); this was espe-
cially seen in soccer players (84% vs. 64%, p = 0.01).  However, after the acute injuries 
were calculated per 1000 exposure hours (training and competition hours combined), no gender differences were found (Table 2). Moreover, no gender difference was found in 
any specific sports in acute injuries sustained in a competition when calculated per 1000 
competition hours.  
There were only a few significant gender differences in what body locations acute  injuries occurred. A higher proportio n of female athletes than male athletes had an acute 
injury at the heel (p < 0.05 ). More male than female athletes had an acute injury in the 
upper back (p < 0.05). After adjustment for sport event these differences were no longer 
statistically significant. The locations of acute injuries by genders are shown in more 
detail in Figure 1.  
A higher proportion of men than women reported an acute muscle injury (44% vs. 
31%, p < 0.05). After adjustment for sport event the difference was no longer statisti-
cally significant. A higher proportion of fema le (46%) than male athletes (33%) reported 
an acute ligament injury (p < 0.05) (Figure 2); this was seen especially in soccer players (71% vs. 42%, p < 0.01).  
 
Overuse injuries 
Four hundred and th irty-three overuse injuries were su stained by 292 athletes (51%). 
Overuse injuries were more prevalent among ma le than female runners (69% vs. 51%, p 
< 0.05), but there was no statistical  significant difference found when the overuse inju-
ries were calculated per 1000 exposure hours (Table 2).   
The specific anatomical locations of overuse  injuries by gender are shown in Fig-
ure 3. A higher proportion of men than women reported an injury in the posterior thigh (p < 0.01). This  was  especially  seen  in  soccer players (p < 0.05). After  adjustment for

A higher proportion of male than female athletes had acute injury in the upper back (4% vs. 0 %, p < 0.05). 
 
sport event male athletes were at increased risk for poste-
rior thigh overuse injuries compared to female (RR 5.8, 
95% CI 1.3-26.4, p < 0.05). In addition, more men than 
women reported toe (p < 0.05) and upper back (p < 0.05) 
injuries. A higher proportion of  female than male athletes 
reported ankle (p < 0.05) injuries (Figure 3). After ad-justment for sport event the risk for overuse ankle injury 
was greater in females than males (RR 3.1, 95% CI 1.0-9.3, p < 0.05). The ankle inju ry rate per 1000 exposure 
hours was also greater in female than male athletes (0.11 
vs. 0.02, p < 0.05). A higher proportion of female than male cross-country skiers reported an overuse injury at

was found in long-distance runners, among whom 68% of female and 82% of male runner s reported injury (p = 0.06 between the sexes).   
When combinin g acute and overuse injuries of the 
ankle and the knee among all athletes, no difference was 
observed in the proportion of injured athletes between females (49%) and males (41%) (p = 0.13). After repeat-
ing the same analysis within sports between the sexes, the 
only significant difference was seen among soccer play-ers. The proportion of female players with such an injury 
was higher than the proportion of male players (75% and 
54% respectively; p < 0.05). In our study an anterior cru-ciate ligament (ACL) injury was identified in six cases,

four of which were women. Five of these ACL injuries 
occurred in soccer players and one female player had been injured twice.  
 
Menstrual irregularities and injuries 
Menstrual irregularities were reported by 40 (13%) 
women and were more common among long-distance 
runners (26%) than soccer players (6%, p = 0.002) or 
swimmers (6%, p = 0.001). Cross-country skiers (16%) 
reported menstrual irregularities more often than swim-mers (6%, p = 0.05) and the same trend was seen also in 
soccer players (6%, p = 0.07). The only difference be-
tween athletes with regular and those with irregular men-
ses was found in overuse injury among cross-country 
skiers (46% vs. 85%, p = 0.01).   
 
Discussion 
 
The primary goal of our study was to investigate gender 
differences in sport-related inju ries during the previous 
twelve months in four sports with different loading pat-
terns. More male than female athletes had at least one acute injury. Also more male th an female long-distance 
runners had at least one overuse injury. However, when 
we calculated the incidence of acute or overuse injuries as the number of injuries per 1000 exposure hours, we found 
no gender differences. A few gender differences were 
observed in the anatomical location of injuries. The main difference was a greater number of overuse injuries in the 
posterior thigh in male th an female athletes, whereas 
females had a greater risk for overuse injuries to the an-kle. The risk for such injuries remained after adjustment 
for sport event. A higher proportion of female soccer 
players had more combined acute and overuse injuries in the ankle and knee than male players.  
More acute injuries per year have been reported 
among male than female athletes (Kujala et al., 1995; 
Sandelin et al., 1980).  Powell and Barber-Foss (2000) 
reported more acute injuries in girl than boy soccer play-ers and Elias (2001) showed slightly greater aggregate 
injuries in female than male soccer players. In addition, 
increased injury risk in female than male for swimmers 
(Sallis et al., 2001) and high-school cross-country runners 
(Rauh et al., 2000) has been reported. Overall, in accor-
dance with our findings, Lanese et al. (1990) found no 
differences in overall injury incidence in different sports 
after adjustment for exposure time. However, Rauh et al. 
(2006) found gender differences after adjusting exposure time. It seems that possible gender differences in the 
injury rate may be partly due to or explained by differ-
ences in exposure time.  
In a review, van Gent et al. (2007) reported that in-
jury rates in the lower extremities were common in both 
female and male runners. The same finding was reported for cross-country skiers (Sandelin et al., 1980; Orava et 
al., 1985), which is in line with our results. An equal 
number of overuse injuries of the lower limbs was also found between males and females in sports other than 
swimming. In contrast to Sallis et al. (2001) and Satter-
thwaite et al. (1999) we found no gender difference be-
tween different groups of sport in injuries in the calf or hip. Sallis et al. (2001) studie d injuries among athletes at 
the intercollegiate level and Satterthwaite et al. (1999) 
studied injuries and other hea lth problems during a mara-
thon race. Differences in study design, such as definition 
of the injury or different data collection methods, may explain these conflicting results.   
Hamstring strains are commo n injuries in sports 
characterized by maximal sprinting, kicking and sudden 
acceleration (Lysholm and Wiklander, 1987). Waldén et 
al. (2005) reported that acute thigh injury in soccer play-ers was the most common inju ry, causing a great amount 
of training and competition time loss. There is evidence 
showing that previous hamstring strains and age (Arnason et al., 2004) are independent risk factors for new ham-
string strains. Thigh injuri es may partly be explained by 
muscle fatigue, high training intensities, insufficient warm-up and hamstring tightness (Kujala et al., 1997), 
but the evidence for this is less convincing (Arnason et 
al., 2004; Bahr and Holme, 2003). In some cases the number of players per soccer team may be low and there-
fore the high amount of playing time per player may in-
crease the risk for thigh injuries, and also the risk for overall injuries. In our study there was no difference be-
tween the sexes in acute thigh injuries. However, a higher 
proportion of our male than female athletes had overuse injuries in the posterior thigh, which is in line with the 
findings of earlier studies (Satterthwaite et al., 1999; 
Sallis et al., 2001) and clinical experience. Hosea et al. 
(2000) found in basketball players that females had 
greater overall risk for ankle injury than males. In our 
study females had a three-fold greater risk than males for 
overuse injury in the ankle. Hi gher joint laxity in females 
may contribute to this finding (Rozzi et al., 1999; Quat-man et al., 2008). 
Similar to the study by McMaster and Troup 
(1993) on elite swimmers, in our swimmers overuse inju-ries occurred mostly in the shoulder region and no gender 
differences were found. Upper back injuries were rare in 
our female swimmers. Sallis et al. (2001) reported more injuries in college fema le than male swimmers in the 
shoulder and back/neck region. They suggested that a 
possible explanation for this difference may be training intensity. However, we did not investigate the training 
intensity, but there was no gender difference in the 
amount of training during the past twelve months.  
Female compared to male basketball or soccer 
players have shown increased risk for traumatic ankle 
injury (Hosea et al., 2000; Elias, 2001). Among our soc-
cer players females had slightly more acute ankle injuries 
than males. Moreover, women had more overuse injuries in the ankle and in the wrist than men. While especially 
ankle injuries are common in both genders, effective 
methods of preventing sports injuries, such as use of in-soles, external joint sup ports and multi-intervention train-
ing programs, have been proposed to prevent injuries 
(Aaltonen et al., 2007). 
Women have been reported to have more knee in-
juries than men, especially ACL injuries (Arendt and 
Dick, 1995; de Loes et al., 2000; Dugan, 2005). Female 
soccer players at the time of injury have been found to be 
younger than male players (Bjordal et al., 1997). During 
Ristolainen et al.
 
 
 449
the present one-year follow-up time only one male soccer 
player suffered from an ACL injury, but no age difference 
was found between the female soccer players who had ACL injury (22.3 yr) and those who did not (21.0 yr, p = 
0.53).  Overall, we found similar numbers of knee injuries 
between men and women in all four sports. Haapasalo et al. (2007) also found  no gender differences in overall 
knee injury risk, except in  endurance sports. When acute 
and overuse injuries in the ankle and knee were com-bined, female soccer players had more such injuries than 
male players, as has been found in earlier studies both for 
the ankle (Hosea et al., 2000; Elias, 2001) and for the knee (Arendt and Dick, 1995; de Loes et al., 2000; 
Dugan, 2005) separately. Such injuries may also cause 
long absence time from training and competition. How-ever, in our study there was no difference between the 
sexes in time-loss from acute or overuse injury (data not 
shown). Injury severity is describ ed in more details in our 
previous article  (Risto lainen et al., in  press, 2009).  
Female sex has been found to be a risk factor for 
stress fractures in the military population (Mattila et al., 
2007), but less so in athletes (Snyder et al., 2006). Iwa-
moto and Takeda (2003) concluded in their review that male athletes tend to have more stress fractures than 
women. The findings are inconsistent as Bennell et al. 
(1996a, 1996b) found an asso ciation between menstrual 
disturbances and stress fractures among runners, but San-
delin et al. (1980) found no association when studying 
cross-country skiers. There was 9.0% of stress fractures in female and 8.8% in male athletes. Nearly 50 % of fe-
male’s stress fractures occurred to those female athletes 
with menstrual irregularities. So, the statistically non-significant association betw een menstrual irregularities 
and stress fractures may be due to low statistical power 
(type two error). 
Approximately one out of every fourth female ath-
letes report having a menstrual irregularity (Nichols et al., 
2006; Torstveit and Sundgot-Borgen, 2005), and these 
have been more common in long-distance runners, ballet 
dancers and gymnasts than in swimmers (Nichols et al., 2006, Torstveit and Sundgot-Borgen, 2005). Our long-
distance runners also had significantly more menstrual 
irregularities than soccer players and swimmers. How-ever, we did not find any association between stress frac-
tures and menstrual irregularities. After adjustment for 
exposure hours we found no association between men-strual irregularities and in the number of injuries.  
In our study the average competition time between 
sports was fairly different (in particular between swim-ming and soccer playing). However, there were no differ-
ence between the sexes in the acute injury occurred in the 
competition within all athletes or within different sport.  
We studied gender differences in four different 
sports, and the injury risk was counted per 1000 exposure 
hours. It should be noted that these sports types differed from each other in loading characteristics and that there 
was only one contact sport. This can be considered both a 
strength and a limitation in our study, as our results indi-cate that gender differences are independent of type of 
sport. However, the low numb er of injuries limited some 
sport-specific injury comparations. We sent the question-
naire to the participants immediately after the competition season, and in each sport the response rate was similar. 
The limitations of this study include the use of self-
reported questionnaire. However, the questionnaire data were validated and reliability-tested against the interview 
data, and were shown to be  accurate (Eloranta  and Titto-
nen, 2006; Karhula and Pakkanen, 2005). Retrospective data collection is a limitation in  our study. Also, the vali-
dation method we used does not exactly reveal the accu-
racy and coverage of the reported injuries, but was more adequate for measuring th e reproducib ility/repeatability 
of the data collection. Comparability between different 
sports should not be a problem in our study as the method applied was the same for all four sports studied. In addi-
tion, the athletes in each sport were on the top-ranking list 
in their sports, and for th is reason were to some extent 
comparable despite their different sport events.  
 
Conclusion 
 
The overall gender-related risk for acute and overuse 
injuries in top-level athletes between the sexes was small. However, we found some gender differences in the spe-
cific anatomical locations of injuries as well as in specific 
injuries in sports. Some of these differences seem to be explained by the differences in th e amount of training.

ABSTRACT  
 
Aim.  The purpose of this study was to clarif y training-related risk  factors for overuse 
injuries.  
Methods and materials.  This was  twelve-month retros pective study which was done by 
self-reported postal questionnaire.   The study group consisted of 446 men and women top-
level Finnish athletes r epresenting three different enduranc e sports (cross-country skiing, 
swimming, long-distance running) between the ages of 15 - 35.  
Risk Factors and Outcome Measurement(s).  Self-reported anthropo metric and training-
related variables (such as star ting age of training, years of  active training, hours trained 
yearly, competition hours and weekly resting days) and occurr ence of  overuse injuries.  
Results.  Athletes with less than 2 weekly resting days during the training season had 5.2-
fold risk (95% confidence interv als [CI] 1.89-14.06, P=0.001) for  an overuse injury, and 
athletes who trained  mor e than 700 hours during a year had 2.1-fold risk  (95% CI 1.21-
3.61, P=0.008) for an overuse injury  compared to the others. At hletes with a tendon injury 
were on average two years older than athl etes without such an injury (P<0.001).  
Conclusion.  We found that low number of recovery days and a high am ount of training 
are training-related risk factors for overuse in juries in top-level en durance athletes. The 
higher number of tendon over use injuries in older than younger athletes may indicate that 
age-related degeneration plays an im portant role in the etiol ogy of tendon injuries. These 
findings should be tak en into account when planning exer cise programs for endurance 
athletes.

INTRODUCTION 
 
Overuse injuries are common  among endurance athletes. Over use injuries have serious 
consequences in terms of costs and training reduction. Injury preve ntion is necessary and 
we need to know the cause of injury mo re specifically before planning preventive 
methods. Earlier studies have s hown that overuse injury occurrence is anatomically 
strictly linked to the specific  loading patterns of each sport.1 Most studies investigating 
risk factors for overuse injury have focused on ru nning injuries.2, 3 Studies have also 
focused specifically on lower extremity injuries,4-6 and on injuries relat ed to cross-country 
skiing 7, 8 and swimming.9, 10  
Injury risk factors can be classified to be eithe r extrinsic, environmental risk factors or 
intrinsic, subject-related risk factors.11, 12  Training errors, such as not allowing enough 
resting time and fatigue, are one of the mos t important extrinsic risk factors for an 
athlete,13 and they are rather eas ily modifiable. Environmental co nditions, like terrain, 
climate and equipments, play als o a major role in the outcome of an injury.13 Subject-
related risk factors for injuries include gender,14 increased age,15 and previous injury.11, 15, 16 
In van Mechelen et al. study11 exposure time and previous in jury was reported to be more 
important predictors of sports  injuries than psychological, psychosoci al, physiological, 
and anthropometrical factors. Menstrual st atus among female at hletes has also been 
shown to be risk factor for an overuse injury.17 In addition, there may be many types of 
interactions between intrinsic and ex trinsic risk factors, such as older athletes may be at 
higher or lower risk for spec ific injuries than  younger athletes duri ng standard training 
programs. These interactions have not been studied widely. 
An overuse injury usually o ccurs gradually due overload or  repetitive micro trauma, 
but can also be a result of inadequ ate recovery time between applied forces.2, 6, 18  Tendon 
overuse injuries in particular are common  in endurance athletes.18 Different etiological 
factors and underlying mechanisms may le ad to tendon degeneration, thereby reducing 
the tensile streng th of the tendon.19 However, the etiology of  degenerative overuse 
tendinopathies is unknown.20 Structural damage may require a longer healing period than 
has earlier been thought.18 Also mechanical loading can stim ulate or delay the repair 
process.20 Studies on risk factors for muscle in juries have mainly focused on hamstring 
injuries21, 22 and soccer players.21, 22 It has been suggested that mu scle injury incidence 
decreases with restoration of normal strength or by in creasing flexibility,21, 23 but evidence 
of the effectiveness of these in terventions remains insufficient.24 In addition, poor 
hamstring flexibility, greater  body weight, greater weekly mileage, and greater muscular 
strength were related to large r joint loading, especially in the knee.25  Reducing these risk 
factors may also decrease the ri sk of joint injury. However , musculoskeletal injuries are 
usually result of the interaction of multiple risk factors.13  
The volume of exercise engaged in by top-level athletes (i ncluding frequency, 
intensity and duration of tr aining sessions) can be very demand ing. Thus training-related 
factors may play an important role in  the etiology of overuse injuries. Little appears to be 
known about the risk factor s for overuse injuries r elated to skiing and swimming.8-10, 26  
The aim of our study was to analyze over all training-related risk  factors for muscle, 
tendon and joint overuse injur ies in cross-country skiing,  in swimming, and in long-
distance running. Des pite known limitations 27-29 of the method, we used retrospective 
questionnaires to document the inju ries, as it is difficult  to organize standardized nation-
 
 
 
 wide detailed injury data collections  covering various individual sports in other way as 
there is no uniform injury  treatment organization.  
 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
 Participants   
 
Data were collected by a retrospective twelve-month questionnaire which was sent to 
Finnish top-level female and male endurance at hletes (15–35 years o ld). The athletes 
(n=833) were cross-country skiers (n=300), swimmers (n=268) and long-distance runners 
(n=265).  Top-level athletes were defined as the bes t-ranked Finnish athl etes in the three 
above-mentioned sports in the 2005 season. The best Finnish male and female skiers were 
identified according to the ranking list of the Finnish Ski As sociation. The best swimmers, 
according to the FINA points system in 2005, over different swimming distances in a 50m 
pool were taken from the website of t he Finnish Swimming As sociation. All the female 
and male runners whose personal record in 2005 was better than  the C level in one of the 
running distances from 1500m to the marathon we re included in the study. In the 
individual sports, athletes were  top-ranking at the end of the previous season.  In cross-
country skiing 11 athletes and in long-distanc e running 3 athletes over 35 years old were 
excluded.  We excluded athl etes over age 35 because they may already be subject to a 
degenerative process and this may influence their injury profile.  One hundred and sixty-
nine skiers, 166 swimmers and 163 runners returned the questionnaire (59.8%, 498/833). 
Of the responded athletes, 446 fulfilled the questionnaire (53.4%, 446/833).  
The term overuse injury was defined as  follows: an injury causes pain during 
exercise loading without  any noticeable external cause of  injury. The in jury gradually 
causes worsening pain during or  after exercise. The pain becomes wo rse when loading is 
continued and may lead to complete cessation of ex ercise, or needs a ph ysician’s care. The 
term acute injury was defined as follows: an acute sports injury  occurs suddenly or 
accidentally, interrupting the exercise or th e competition of the athlete or causing an 
identifiable trauma.  One criterion of an acute injury is that it keep s the athlete away from 
at least one training session, or comp etition, or needs a physician’s care.  All overuse and 
acute  injuries were recorded separat ely but acute injuries were  excluded from this study.1 
Therefore in this article the te rm "injury" refers to “overuse in jury”.  The specific incidence 
of acute and overuse in juries, their anatomical location, and sex differences have been 
reported earlier.1, 30 The total number of exposure hours per year (training and competition 
hours) was calculated on the basis of six ques tions (Table I). Female respondents were also 
asked to state  status of menstrual cycle. The questions  the athletes were  asked concerning 
overuse injury risk factors are presented in Table I.  
The retrospective questionn aire was validated and reliab ility-tested against the 
interview data, and was found to be accurate .(31, 32) The reliability of the event and 
training information was good or exc ellent (ICC=0.81 – 0.95, P<0.001). Questions which 
were not repeatable or unable to underst and correctly were omitted from the final 
questionnaire.  The study protocol was approved by the ethics committee of  the University 
of Jyväskylä.

 Statistical Analyses 
The statistical analyses we re performed with SPSS ( Version 15.0; Inc., Chicago, IL.) 
Frequencies, proportions, mean and standard deviations (SD)  were used as descriptive 
statistics. Pearson chi-squa re was applied to calculate statistical dif ferences in the 
distributions between t he different sports. t tests were applied to compare skiing, 
swimming and running kilomet res between injured and non-inj ured athletes and also to 
compare the age of first menses between injured and non-inj ured female athletes. 
Univariate analysis of varianc e, with sex and sport as covariates in the between-sports 
analysis and sex as a covariate in the within-sport anal yses, was used to compare athletes 
without and with tendon, joint, muscle and all other overuse inju ries. The level of 
significance was set at P<0.05. The results of the analyses of the risk  factors for injuries 
were adjusted for sex and sport (covariate-adjusted) except for  the risk factors within each 
sport, which were as adjusted only by sex, and menstrual status, which was adjusted only 
by sport. We used logistic regression models to analyze the association between covariates 
and injuries. Sex and sport were used as covariates in all the logistic regression models. 
When investigating the risk factors for inju ries between the different sports, we used 
swimming as a reference sport in all the logist ic regression models exc ept for injuries to 
the upper extremities, wher e the corresponding referenc e sport was running. The 
associations were expressed using odds ra tios (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals 
(CI). P values were below 0.05.  
 
RESULTS  
 
The questionnaire was returned by 446 top-lev el athletes (149 cross-co untry skiers, 154 
swimmers and 143 long-distance runners). Th e question “Have you had an overuse injury 
during the past twelve months” was answered by 441 athletes. Two hundred and thirty-
eight athletes reported at leas t one injury (54%, 238/441), and t he total number of injuries 
was 352. Anthropometrics and training in formation are shown in Table II.  
 
All overuse injuries 
 
There were 50% of the studied cross-country skiers, 51% of the swi mmers and 59% of the 
long-distance runners who have had at least one ov eruse injury during past year (Table II). 
Skiers’ overuse injury  incidence (injuries to 1000 exposu re hours) was 1.35, in swimmers it 
was 1.48 and in runners 1.67.  S pecific overuse in jury incidence by different anatomical 
locations is seen in Table  III.   
The mean age of the athletes with at least one injury compared to those with no 
injury during the past twelve months was hi gher after adjustmen t for sex and sport 
(P=0.01) (Table IV). This was especially seen in long-distance runners (sex-adjusted means 
25.3 y vs 22.9 y, P=0.007).  
The covariate adjusted mean of exposure hours showed a tr end in the athletes with 
an injury compared to those with  no injury (P=0.12) (Table IV ). The average number of 
training camp days was significantly higher in  the athletes who had an injury than in 
those without an injury (P=0.04) (Table IV). Th e athletes with an over use injury had on 
average fewer resting days weekly during the training s eason compared to those with no 
injury (P=0.006) (Table IV). First menses had, on average, ea rlier in the athletes with an 
injury than in those without (P=0.03) (Table IV).

 Sport, sex, age, training camp days during t he year, and number of  resting days weekly 
during the training season  were  entered into a logistic regression analysis to identify 
independent predictors for inju ries. According to our mult ivariate model, age increased 
the risk for sustaining an injury (Odds Ratio [OR] 1.06/year ; 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 
1.008-1.108, P=0.02) while a higher number of weekly resting days in train ing season had a 
preventive effect (OR 0.66/day, 95% CI 0.44- 0.995, P=0.05). From these three endurance 
sports only injured swimmers had swum si gnificantly more than non-injured swimmers 
during past twelve months (1612  km vs 1380 km, P=0.04). Dif ferences in skiing kilometres 
between injured and non-injured skiers (3065 km vs 2912 k m, P=0.43) and in running 
kilometers between injured and non -injured runners (3357 km vs 3020 km, P=0.27) were 
non-significant. First menses had, on average, occurred earlier in athletes with at least one 
injury compared with athletes with no injury (Table V). Th e training-related risk factors 
for injuries are shown in  more detail in Table V. 
From a clinical point of view  we also categorised the s ignificant training-related risk 
and supportive factors for an injury. Injury risk was five times higher in athletes with less 
than two resting days w eekly during the training season  compared to athletes with more 
than two resting days week ly (OR 5.16; 95% CI 1.89-14.06, P =0.001). Higher risk was also 
seen in athletes with over 700 exposure hours du ring the year than athletes less than 700 
exposure hours (OR = 2.10, 95% CI = 1.21, 3.61, P= 0.008). In athletes with more than 12 
active training years injury risk  was higher than athletes with  less than 12 active training 
years (OR 1.67; 95% CI 1.11-2.52, P=0.01).  
 
Tendon injuries  
A total of 102 tendon injuries  was reported by 92 athl etes (20.9%, 92/441). The most 
common anatomical sites for tendon injury were the Ach illes tendon (22.5%, 23/102), knee 
region (20.6%, 21/102), and shoulder region (14.7 %, 15/102). The risk for tendon injury 
was 2.3-fold (95% CI 1.26-4.04, P=0.006) in long -distance runners compared to swimmers. 
One-fifth of the cross-country skie rs had at least one tendon injury. 
The covariate-adjusted mean age of athletes with at least one tendon injury was 
higher compared to those wi thout such an injury (P <0.001) (Table IV). Exposure hours 
during the past year were not  associated with tendon injuries  (Table IV), but the athletes 
with at least one tendon injury  compared to those without a t endon injury had on average 
fewer resting days weekly during the training season (P=0.03) (Table IV). The athletes 
with a tendon injury had start ed their sporting career one year  later (P=0.05), but reported 
more active training years (P= 0.003) than those without such an  injury (Table IV). Number 
of kilometres run during the past year was not associated with having or not having a 
tendon injury in the runn ers (3331 km vs 3172 km, P=0.61).  
 To further analyze the predictors for tendon in juries, sport, sex,  age, start training 
age, and number of weekly resting days in the trainin g season were entered into a logistic 
regression analysis. The only pr edictor of risk for an injury  was age (OR 1.08/year; 95% CI 
1.02-1.14, P=0.005). The training-rela ted risk factors for tendon in juries are shown in Table

 Joint injuries 
 
Fifty-nine joint injuries (12 ru nning, 13 skiing and 34 swimmi ng injuries) occurred in 50 
athletes. In half of the runner s (6/12) and over forty percent (6/13) of the skiers the joint 
injuries were sustained to t he knee. Nearly sixty percent (20/34) of  the joint injuries in the 
swimmers were in the shoulder region. The number of compet itions was on average lower 
in the athletes with a joint in jury than in those without a joint injury (P=0.01) (Table IV). 
The mean number of kilometres swum was hig her in swimmers with at least one joint 
injury compared to swimmers without such an  injury (1750 km vs 1437 km, P=0.03). There 
were no differences betw een number of kilometers of sk iing or running kilometers and 
joint injuries. 
Sport, sex, age, BMI, exposure hours during the past year, and number of 
competitions  were  entered into a logistic regress ion analysis to iden tify independent 
predictors for joint injuries. A lower number of competitions during the past year was a 
preventive factor for a joint injury (OR 0.95/unit decrease; 95% CI 0.91-0.0995, P =0.03). 
 
Muscle injuries 
 
Eighty-nine muscle injuries occurred in 75 athletes (17.0%, 75/441). The most common 
anatomical sites for a muscle injury were shin and calf combined (24.7%, 22/89), low back 
(20.2%, 18/89) and the shoulder region (20.2%, 18/89). Over fifty percent (18/31) of 
swimmers’ muscle injuries we re reported in the shoulder region, whereas among the 
runners (39.3%, 11/28) and the skier s (33.3%, 10/30) shin and calf injuries were the most 
common anatomical site of the overuse injury. The athletes with a muscle injury were 
slightly heavier than the athlet es without a muscle injury (c ovariate-adjusted mean 66.6 kg 
vs 64.7 kg, P=0.05) (Table IV).  
Sex, sport, age and weight were entered in to a logistic regression analysis to identify 
the risk factors for a muscle injury. The only  risk factor that emerg ed was higher weight 
(OR 1.04/kg increase; 95% CI 1.001-1.082 , P=0.04). 
 
DISCUSSION  
 
Our purpose was to study the training-relat ed risk factors for tendon, muscle and joint 
overuse injuries as well as for all overus e injuries in top-lev el endurance athletes. In 
general, older athletes were at a higher risk for injury; th is was especially evident among 
the long-distance runners and in  respect of tendon injuries. The athletes with less than two 
resting days weekly during t he training season had an over fi ve-fold risk for an injury. The 
athletes with more than 700 hours exposure during the year had a two-fold risk for an 
injury.  
The role of age as a risk factor for in juries remains controver sial. Some studies have 
shown that in runner s injury risk is independent of age.7, 33 Sandelin et al.8 found that male 
cross-country skiers under 30 years had more injuries than older ones, and Marti et al.33 
concluded that with increasing ag e the incidence of running injury dec reased. Engebretsen 
et al.34 in turn found that injured male and female winter sports athletes did not differ in 
age from their non-injured cou nterparts. In our study, regular ly competing athletes with 
an injury were on average one year olde r than those without such an injury.  
 
Earlier studies7, 33 have suggested that running volume is a risk factor for injuries, although 
conflicting results exist.2, 35 Hreljac et al.4 also found no differences between distance run 
weekly between those who had never  sustained an overuse lower limb injury attributed to 
running and those that had sustained at least  one overuse injury attributed to running.  
Similarly, we found no assoc iation between injuries and number  of kilometres run weekly, 
but a low number of weekly rest days and high number of training camp days were 
associated with higher  risk for overuse in jury. Van Mechelen et al.11 in their study of the 
general population found that high exposure time was a risk factor for overall injury. 
Among our athletes, those with a high numb er of annual exposure hours were at 
increased risk for injury. Because there were a quite few number of athletes in the different 
sports with over 700 hours/year of trainin g and because the annual number of exposure 
hours varied between the different sports, we counted all three sports together. 
Furthermore, a trend emerged that overuse injuries were comm on in athletes with long 
running experience. In an earlier study, runners with more than  ten years experience had 
an increased risk fo r Achilles tendinopathy. 36 However, Plisky et al.37 found no 
association between running experience and medi al tibial stress syndrome. These 
conflicting results may be explained by differ ences in the overuse injury, the populations 
studied, and the study design. Th e so called "healthy exercise r bias" (those who are not 
injured score more training hours ) may also explain the differ ences in results between 
studies.  
Among swimmers and skiers ov eruse musculoskeletal injur ies can also result from 
training other than swimming or skiing,  including weight lifting, plyometrics, and 
running.1, 38 The return to training after an in jury must follow a logical, gradual 
progression to prevent recurrence. A gradual re turn over time will have greater benefits 
on performance in the long term  than doing too much, too soon.38 Training without resting 
may have a negative influence on over use injuries. Vetter & Symonds 39 found that there 
does not seem to be a real ‘‘off season’’ as at hletes train for almost 12 months a year. They 
suggested that periodization and r est are extremely important to help avoid overreaching 
and overtraining leading to excessive physical exhau stion and injury.  Jones 40 reported 
that upper-extremity overuse injuries such as stress fractures have also become more 
frequent among athletes, and that a majority of these fractur es are caused by overuse and 
fatigue of the surrounding mu sculature. We found also in our study that weekly resting 
time, along with appropriate training and con ditioning, is important to athletes to prevent 
overuse injuries  
Because tendon, joint and muscle overuse inju ries were the most common types in 
our athletes, we concentrated on  these injuries. A high number of ac tive training years 
were associated with tendon injuries, and our at hletes with tendon injuries were also older 
than those without such inju ries. Only 16% of the athlet es under age 20, but 39% of the 
athletes over age 30 had suffered from a tendon inju ry. Kujala et al.41 also reported that 
tendon problems are common among former elite older endurance at hletes. Age-related 
degeneration seems to play an important role in the etiology of tendon injuries.41 The 
majority of sports-related tendino pathies develop as a result of either excessive quantity or 
poor quality of movement, or both. Repetiti ve loading of tendon within the physiologic 
range leads to cumulative microtrauma, whic h may require days or weeks to fully self-
repair.42 Tendon injuries were especially comm on among the present long-distance 
runners with, typically, a short weekly restin g time from training. The runners with 
 
 
 
 tendon injuries had on average more exposure  hours per year than those without such an 
injury. Our findings  support the suggestion, that overus e injuries can partly be explained 
by excessive training without enough r esting time. An average of two resting days per 
week clearly reduced t he risk of injury, and there was a statistically non -significant trend 
that those athletes who had on average one day of rest per week had a 15% lower risk of 
injuries compared to those with  fewer resting days. Sein et al.43 reported that the number 
of hours swum/week and weekly mileag e both correlated significantly with 
supraspinatus tendino pathy in elite swimmers. In our st udy a correlation was found in 
swimmers between annual number of kilometer s swum and a joint injury. However, no 
correlations between swimmers or skiers with a tendon injury and annual swimming or 
skiing kilometers (results not shown) were found. To avoid in juries, proper resting time is 
important for all athletes, and may be especially important for ol der athletes with a long 
training history.  
Overall, we did not found many risk factors for joint injuries in endurance athletes. 
Athletes with a joint injury reported on average to having fewer competitions during the 
year than the others. This may, however, be partly  explained by long absence (over 3 
weeks) from competitions in the athletes with a severe join t injury (results are not shown). 
Among swimmers high exposure time was associated with joint injuries.  
Muscle injuries have been reported to be common among cross-country skiers.8 This 
also emerged in our study. Ever y third cross-country skier in our sample had a muscle 
injury in the low back, and in a ccordance with earlier findings 44, 45 these injuries were 
more common when using the c lassic than the skat ing technique. In classic skiing the 
spine is loaded by repetitiv e movements from extension to deep flexion and also by 
repetitive rotation, while in t he skating technique the spine is held more stable and in a 
vertical position. 44, 45 Repetitive movements in the back may contribute low back injuries 
and pain.  
Recurrent compartment sy ndrome occurs when the pressure in a muscular 
compartment is intermi ttently elevated during high levels of activity in that group of 
muscles. The deep posterior compartment in t he lower leg is the most commonly affected 
and this may cause medial tibial pain.46  This is common esp ecially among runners.37 In 
our study, in every fourth athlete with a muscle overus e injury, especially among skiers 
and runners, the injury was located in the shin or calf.  In the study by Moen et al.47 a 
higher body mass index was as sociated with longer durati on to full recovery from medial 
tibial stress syndrome, and Plisky et al.37 also reported that a hig her body mass index is a 
risk factor for such a syndrome. In the present study we did not exam ine the recovery time 
from injury in relation to spec ific types of injury. However , we found that weight was a 
slight risk factor for all muscle injuries. We did not find any other training-related risk 
factors for muscle injuries.  
This study has some limi tations. Our questionnaire was rather long that might have 
an influence on the response rate. Further, we  used retrospective se lf-reports to document 
injuries, since our large natio n-wide survey covered various individual sports. It has been 
shown that retrospective study has some restriction, such as recall bias:48 a memory decay, 
which means the loss of informa tion due to failure to recall the event, and the telescoping 
effect, which is the tendency to remember events in the past as  if they occurred closer to 
the present than they actu ally did. Junge & Dvorak 28 found that the one-year incidence of 
injuries reported re trospectively was s ignificantly lower than th at documented on the 
basis of weekly follow-up examinations. Braham et al.27 suggest that data should be 
collected on site and not rely on  athletes recall. However, Gabbe et al.49 found that there 
can be both overreporting and  underreporting in a self-r eporting survey. Walter & Hart29 
reported that retrospective surveys are less likely to prov ide accurate incidence data 
because they rely on athlet es’ responses and on diagnoses that lack verification by a 
physician. Therefore, t hese limitations should be kept in mind when  interpreting the 
results. On the contrary, Valuri et al.50 noted that self-reported da ta agreement was highest 
for details such as the body par t injured, but did not appear to be an accurate source of 
information concerning the injury severity. In our study t he severity of the injury was 
defined according to the time loss from training and competit ion which is easier to report 
by the athletes due to fact that elite athletes also usually keep a trai ning diary, which can 
be expected to improve the accu racy of the data reported in questionnaires. In addition, 
our athletes tend to have c lose relations of co-operation with  physicians regarding their 
medical problems, and  athletes also know about more their injuries than other laymen. In 
a retrospective study caus e and effect may be difficult to determine. It may be possible 
that some risk factors are a result  rather than a cause of in juries. When using self-reports 
the exact diagnosis of injury is difficult. According to the study by Gabbe et al.49 recall 
accuracy declines as the level of  detail requested increases. It is for this reason that we did 
not analyze diagnosis and other spec ific injury details to avoid false results.  The present 
differentiation of tendon, muscle and joint injuries are bas ed on self-diagnosis, which may 
decrease the accuracy of the report  regarding the type of injury. 
 
CONCLUSIONS  
 
Overuse injuries were comm on in our top-level endurance athletes. Older athletes and 
athletes with less weekly resting time during t he training season more commonly reported 
at least one injury. Risk for tendon inju ry increased with age.  Excessive  training and 
inadequate rest may lead to overuse injuries. These findings should be taken into account 
when planning exercise progra ms for endurance athletes.

Abstract
Injuries are common among athletes, and are sometimes so severe that they affect an athlete’s career in sport. As studies on
sport career termination are few, we conducted a study to investigate the role of injuries as a reason for ending a sport career.
The study group consisted of 574 male and female top-level cross-country skiers, swimmers, long-distance runners and
soccer players who responded to a retrospective postal questionnaire in 2006. Twenty-seven athletes (4.9%, 27/548)
reported ending their sport career because of injury. A follow-up interview was conducted by telephone in 2007 ( n/C3020
volunteered to be interviewed) to confirm sport career termination and the reasons for this. Fifteen of the interviewed
athletes terminated and five continued their sport on the same level as earlier. Female athletes (12/15) terminated their sport
career more frequently than male athletes (3/15). Athletes who reported terminating their sport career because of injury
were on average two and a half years older (24.1 years vs. 21.6 years, P/C300.006) than athletes who continued the sport. All
the swimmers ( n/C305) who were interviewed terminated their career because of a shoulder injury. All the soccer players who
ended their career ( n/C304) were female and had a severe knee injury, such as anterior cruciate ligament injury. Most of the
athletes who terminated their sport career (70.4%, 19/27) reported that the injury caused them mild or moderate
permanent disability. We found that sports injuries play a significant role in terminating a career in sport, and in some sports
events injuries may commonly be the main reason for sport career termination. Injury prevention and adequate treatment
and rehabilitation of injuries are thus essential to avoid the long-term consequences of severe sport injuries.

Introduction
Regular physical activity is essential for optimal
functioning and important for health (Kujala,
2004; Kujala, Orava, Parkkari, Kaprio, & Sarna,
2003; Nelson et al., 2007). Injuries are common
among athletes and, in severe cases, can terminate an
athlete ?s career in sport. Only a few studies have
investigated the reasons for ending a sport career.
Most of these studies have been quantitative and
have focused on psychological factors such as self-
esteem and life satisfaction (Brown, Gilbourne, &
Claydon, 2009; Perna, Ahlgren, & Zaichkowsky,
1999; Thing, 2006). Some studies have focused on
either male or female athletes (Drawer & Fuller,
2001; So ¨derman, Pietila, Alfredson, & Werner,2002; Thing, 2006), while studies including both
sexes are rare (Darrow, Collings, Yard, & Comstock,
2009). The role of injuries as a reason for ending a
career in sport has been little studied. Kettunen,
Kujala, Kaprio, Koskenvuo, and Sarna (2001)
reported that every fifth athlete in a sample of
former elite male athletes had terminated their career
because of an injury, and in the study by Drawer and
Fuller (2001) injuries accounted for as many as 47%
of such cases. According to Vuolle (2008), nearly
half of Finnish ice hockey players reported that one
of the reasons for ending their career in sport was an
injury. Studies on this issue have mainly concen-
trated on team sports like soccer (Drawer & Fuller,
2001; So ¨derman et al., 2002), where severe injuries,

such as anterior cruciate ligament injuries (ACL),
are more common (So ¨derman et al., 2002; Walden,
Hagglund, Werner, & Ekstrand, 2011). Studies
focusing on athletes who terminate their sport
career, and the influence of injuries on this decision,
are lacking. Our purpose was to investigate the role
of injuries as a reason for ending a sport career
among Finnish top-level athletes drawn from sports
with different types of loading (cross-country skiing,
swimming, long-distance running and soccer).
Methods
The target group of this retrospective injury study
consisted of top-level Finnish male and female
athletes (range 15 /C135 years) representing four dif-
ferent sports and loading modalities (Ristolainen
et al., 2010). The athletes included cross-country
skiers (repetitive loading on upper and lower ex-
tremities), swimmers (repetitive loading on upper
extremities without impact loads), long-distance
runners (repetitive loading on lower extremities)
and soccer players (high risk for impact loads and
sprains). The best Finnish male and female skiers
were identified according to the ranking list of the
Finnish Ski Association. The best swimmers were
recruited according to the Fe ´de´ration Internationale
de Nation (FINA) points system in 2005 over
different swimming distances in a 50 m pool and
their names taken from the website of the Finnish
Swimming Association. All the female and male
runners whose personal record in 2005 was better
than the C level in one of the running distances from
1500 m to marathon were included in the study. In
the individual sports, the selected athletes had been
top-ranking at the end of the previous season. All
male and female players who were members of
Finnish Football League teams at the beginning of
2006 were chosen from the list posted on the website
of the Finnish Football League Association (Risto-
lainen et al., 2010).
A sport injury questionnaire was sent at the end of
the competition season to 300 top-ranking cross-
country skiers, 268 swimmers, 265 long-distance
runners and 367 soccer players (21 teams). In cross-
country skiing 11 athletes over 35 years old and in
long-distance running 3 athletes over 35 years old
were excluded. From the soccer players the A ˚land
team and foreign players were excluded, as also were
three male and three female soccer teams with a low
response rate (Ristolainen et al., 2010). Altogether,
639 athletes (59%) responded. Sixty-five of them
returned an empty questionnaire. The final study
group consisted of 149 cross-country skiers, 154
swimmers, 143 long-distance runners and 128
soccer players, 548 of whom responded to thisspecific question concerning the end their sport
career.
Postal questionnaire
The questionnaire included separate items on training
hours and frequency of training per week during both
training and competition seasons as well as on the
length of the training and competition seasons. On the
basis of these six questions, the total number of
exposure hours per year was calculated. Injury rates
were reported as number of injuries per 1000 hours of
exposure, combining any type of training exercise and
competition. In addition, the questionnaire included
questions about exercise habits and the specific
reasons for ending the sport career.
The term ‘‘sport career termination’’ was defined
as ending a career in sport at a level where the athlete
has practised and actively competed (Kleiber &
Brock, 1992). A sport career was also considered
terminated where an athlete continued to participate
in the same sports event but at a lower level (less
targeted), or the where the athlete had changed the
event. Severe injury was defined as loss of time from
training and competition of at least three weeks
duration (Arnason et al., 2004).
The term ‘‘acute sports injury’’ definition was
modified from the determinations of Orchard and
Seward (2002) and So ¨derman, Alfredson, and
Pietila (2001) as an injury that occurs suddenly or
accidentally, interrupting an athlete’s training or
ability to compete, or causing an identifiable trauma.
An acute injury is any physical injury that keeps the
athlete away from at least one training session, or
competition, or needs a physician’s care. The term
‘‘overuse injury’’ definition was modified from the
determinations of Beck (1998) and Brukner and
Bennell (1997) and was defined as an injury that
causes pain during exercise loading without any
noticeable external cause of injury. The injury
gradually causes worsening pain during or after
exercise. Pain becomes worse when loading is
continued and may stop exercise completely.
The retrospective questionnaire was validated and
reliability-tested by checking the answers to the
questionnaire at an interview held one week later
among 54 athletes in different sports events (Eloranta
& Tittonen, 2006; Karhula & Pakkanen, 2005).
The reliability of the event and training information
was good or excellent (Intraclass correlation,
ICC/C300.81/C10.95, PB0.001). The questions of ca-
reer termination and the classification of career
termination were answered identically. Following
the suggestion by Karhula and Pakkanen (2005), the
details of career-terminating injuries were elicited by
interview.2 L. Ristolainen et al.
Semi-structured telephone interview
Athletes who reported terminating their sport career
because of injury in the postal questionnaire and
gave permission for further study of their situation
were interviewed by telephone. The interview, with a
questionnaire, was conducted seven to 11 months
after the postal questionnaire, in order to confirm
that they had terminated their sport career and to
confirm their reason for termination. Figure 1 shows
the data collection and distribution of athletes
among the different sports.
The interview included structured and open
questions. Athletes were asked about the injurythat had influenced their decision to end their sport
career, and they were also asked to state any non-
medical reasons. They were asked about possible
injury-induced disability at work, in the home, and
during leisure time, and about injury-related pain
during the previous seven days and use of painkillers.
The athletes were also asked about the frequency
and intensity of leisure time physical exercise. Pain
during the past seven days and disability at work,
home and leisure time was assessed with a 10 cm
visual analogue scale (VAS). The study protocol was
approved by the ethics committee of the University
of Jyva ¨skyla¨.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed with PASW
(version 18.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA).
The Pearson chi-square test, t-tests and analysis of
variance were applied to calculate statistical differ-
ences in distributions between the athletes continu-
ing and those terminating their sport career. P5
0.05, two-tailed, was considered a statistically sig-
nificant threshold.
Results
The sport injury questionnaire
According to the questionnaire, 52 (9%) out of 548
athletes reported that they had terminated their
sport career. The proportion of athletes who had
terminated their sport career was higher among the
female (13%, 40/304) than the male athletes (5%,
12/244, PB0.001). Of the athletes who had ended
their sport career, 42% were swimmers, 23% were
long-distance runners, 19% were soccer players and
15% were cross-country skiers. All the soccer players
who did not continue playing were female. Detailed
information on the study group is shown in Figure 1.
A reason for termination was given by 50 athletes.
Slightly over half of them (54%, 27/50) had termi-
nated their sport career because of an injury. Forty-
one percent (11/27) reported acute injury/injuries as
the main or as a contributory reason for termination
(Table I). These injuries comprised severe ligament
injuries and contusions. Fifty-two percent (14/27)
reported overuse injury/injuries as a reason for end-
ing their career (Table I). The injuries in this category
were mainly joint injuries. Two female athletes had
sustained both an acute and an overuse injury.
Details of the anatomical site of injuries are given in
Table I.
Athletes who reported terminating their sport
career because of injury were on average two and
a half years older (24.1 years vs. 21.6 years,
P/C300.006) than athletes who continued in their
sport (Table II). No difference in age was observed
between female and male athletes who had ended
their sport career. The incidence of acute (3.0 vs.
1.4, P/C300.015) and overuse injuries (2.8 vs. 1.4,
P/C300.015) per 1000 exposure hours was higher in
athletes who had terminated their career than in
those who had continued. However, athletes who
had terminated their sport career had participated
in fewer competitions during the past year
(PB0.001) and in fewer training camp days
(P/C300.008) than those who had continued their
sport career (Table II). Athletes who had ended
their career also reported slightly more time away
from training and competition because of acute
injury ( P/C300.055) and significantly more time awaybecause of overuse injury ( PB0.001) than athletes
who had continued with their sport (Table II).
There were no differences in warming up, cooling
down and stretching between athletes who had
continued their sport and athletes who had ended
their sport because of injury (Table II). Some of the
athletes had to end their career despite a good
ranking position.
Semi-structured telephone interview
Twenty of the 27 athletes (who had ended their
sport career because of injury) agreed to a tele-
phone interview (Figure 1). Anthropometric, train-
ing, and injury details are shown in Table II. Eleven
of these athletes had terminated their sport career
completely and four athletes had made a come-back
but on a lower level. Five of the twenty athletes
(25%) had subsequently continued their sport
career on the same level as earlier. Two of these
reported minor injuries only, and three had under-
gone surgery and recovered well enough to be able
to continue their sport career. Five of the athletes
who had terminated their sport career had received
surgery, one skier because of a stress fracture, one
swimmer because of injury in the knee region and
three soccer players had undergone ACL surgery.Table I. Twenty-seven athletes reported an injury as the main or
as a contributory reason for ending their sport career (results from
the questionnaire)

$Three athletes had a recurrent knee injury.
Two female athletes had both an acute and an overuse injury and
in the case of two athletes the injury type was unknown.4 L. Ristolainen et al.
Altogether, 15 athletes (12 female, 3 male) were
interviewed in detail (Figure 1).
All the swimmers who had ended their career had
sustained a shoulder injury. The diagnoses of
these injuries were various (i.e. fracture/luxation,
nerve compression). One of them also had knee
problems, which might have influenced her decision
to end top-level swimming. All the soccer players
who had terminated were female and all had
sustained an acute knee ligament injury. Three of
them had an ACL injury in both knees. Among the
cross-country skiers the main reason for termination
was stress fracture in the shin or hip region. In the
long-distance runners the injuries had been sus-
tained mainly in the knee or low back. The reasons
for termination were recurrent knee meniscal injury
and patella luxation. Among the athletes whoreported permanently ending their sport career (9/
15) contributory reasons for termination, in addition
to injury, included studying ( n/C304), lack of motiva-
tion ( n/C304) and pregnancy ( n/C301). In 12 athletes
severe acute or overuse injury caused absence from
training and competition of over 30 days duration,
the average being 132 days/year [d/y] (range 30 /C1270
days). Details of the athletes terminating their career
are given in Table III.
The athletes had on average visited a physician 1.7
times during the past year because of injury, the most
common of which was a knee injury. Although
two-thirds of the athletes reported pain because of
injury, only 40% reported taking painkillers during
the past twelve months. Only one-third of the athletes
had taken painkillers more than once a week. The
athletes who had ended their career had an averageTable II. Characteristics of athletes who have continued and those who have terminated their sport career because of injury, adjusted for

Discussion
Based on our questionnaire study conducted at the
end of the studied season, 27 athletes (5% of the
subjects) reported that they had ended their sport
career because of an injury. More female than male
athletes reported terminating their sport career.
Among the different sport groups, swimmers were
the most prone to end their career and in all cases the
reason was a shoulder injury. Because the swimmers
were young, another common contributory reason
for ending their sport career was to enrol in further
or higher education. All the soccer players who
terminated their sport career were females with
severe knee injuries. The first author interviewed
by telephone 20 of the 27 athletes, who had reported
ending their career, 7 to 11 months after the postal
questionnaire. Five of these (25%) were continuing
their sport career on the same level as earlier. Severe
acute and overuse injuries to the large joints,
shoulder and knee were the most common reasons
for career termination. Seventy percent of the
athletes ending their career reported that injury
caused them mild or moderate permanent disability
in performing activities of daily life.
Nine percent of our athletes reported ending their
sport career after one season, and in 5% of these
athletes the reason for career termination was mainly
or partially an injury. In the study by Kleiber and
Brock (1992) 13% of their sample of athletes had a
career-ending injury. Kettunen et al. (2001) found
that 20% of former male athletes in different sport
events reported that an injury was the main reason
for ending their athletic career. Their follow-up time,
15 years, was much longer than ours, which explainsthe larger number of athletes terminating because of
injury. During an athletic career multiple injuries or
recurrent injuries at the same sites may be sustained,
leading eventually to termination of the sport as a
career. In our study we asked athletes about their
sport career covering a 12 month follow-up of
occurrence of injuries with a 7 to 11 month interval
between the postal questionnaire and interview; this
relatively short follow-up may explain the low
number of terminating athletes. Drawer and Fuller
(2001) in their study of male former soccer players
reported that nearly half of the responders had ended
their sport career because of injury, most commonly
an overuse injury. Their study comprised purely
soccer players and soccer players incur more injuries,
especially acute and severe ones, than athletes in
individual sports (Ristolainen et al., 2010). In
Drawer and Fuller (2001) the self-report question-
naire was returned by only 37% of soccer players,
which may influence the results. Most of the injuries
in their study that led to early retirement from sport
were knee injuries. In our study the reasons for
ending the sport were divided equally between acute
and overuse injuries; however, in all the soccer
players the reason was an acute knee injury. Overall,
our findings are in line with the earlier view that
injuries play a significant role in terminating a career
in sport, and in some sports events injuries may
commonly be the main reason for sport career
termination.
Although a high number of sport injuries occur in
different sports each year, such injuries are not
usually severe (Kujala et al., 2003). Severe injury
rates and patterns varied by sport, gender and type of
exposure (Darrow et al., 2009). Nevertheless, severe
injuries also cause considerable loss of training and
competition time (Hagglund, Walden, & Ekstrand,
2006; Ristolainen et al., 2010). Our athletes who
ended their career had significantly more injuries per
1000 exposure hours than those who continued with
the sport. On average they lost over four months
training and competition time during the previous
twelve months. Long absence from a regular exercise
program because of severe injuries may be frustrat-
ing for an athlete. Based on the exposure hours
reported, the injured athletes who had ended their
sport career had continued to train despite theirTable III. Description of the athletes who terminated their sport career (results from the telephone interview)

injuries, but they had participated in fewer competi-
tions and training camp days than the athletes who
had continued with their sport. Might it be possible
to focus more specifically on helping athletes who are
physically active but spend long periods away from
competitions and hard training and are consequently
at risk of ending their sport career, to reduce that
risk? Is there a need for better rehabilitation pro-
grams or overall training methods which would
improve the recovery process? This is an issue which
calls for more research.
So¨derman et al. (2002) reported that 78% of
young female soccer players after 2 /C17 years of an
ACL injury had stopped playing soccer, most
commonly because of symptoms in their injured
knee. Among our career-ending athletes all the ACL
injuries had been incurred by female soccer players.
Two of them had an ACL injury in both knees and
three out of five athletes had undergone a knee
operation because of such an injury. Most of our
career-ending athletes with a knee injury reported
pain and disability in squatting, and also difficulty in
jumping. Despite their injuries and symptoms, most
of the athletes continued at least to engage in regular
leisure-time physical activity after ending their sport
career.
In all the sport groups the athletes who terminated
their career were somewhat older than those who
continued. While the mean age of all the cross-
country skiers was high, the oldest age at career
termination was reported by the runners. The
athletes who ended their career had more acute
and overuse injuries that those who continued their
career. The different loading patterns in the different
sports were also associated with the injuries sus-
tained: swimmers had shoulder region injuries,
soccer players knee region injuries, and long-
distance runners and cross-country skiers lower
extremity injuries; the latter were mainly overuse
injuries such as stress fractures. It seems that older
athletes with sport event-specific injuries are at
increased risk for terminating their career.
Previous studies have reported on strategies for
preventing athletic injuries (Hupperets, Verhagen, &
van Mechelen, 2009; Pasanen et al., 2008). The
proper care and management of injured athletes is
essential. This is also a challenge for the athlete’s
team members: how can rehabilitation and training
programmes be tailored to suit the needs of the
injured athlete? However, if we consider health from
the viewpoint of an athlete’s later years, it may be
that in the case of some sports injuries the decision to
end a sport career is preferable to rehabilitation and
thus continuation in elite sport. In this connection it
is important for the athlete to know what he/she can
do to reduce the risk of injury. However, one of the
most crucial issues is to find and deploy methods ofpreventing severe injuries that may terminate an
athlete’s career.
The impact of an athletic injury is dependent on a
number of factors such as the nature and severity of
the injury and the importance of sport in the
athlete’s life. Studies on athletes’ fear of re-injury
are few and have generally investigated athletes
recovering from severe ACL injury (Chimielewski
et al., 2008; Kvist, Ek, Sporrstedt, & Good, 2005;
Lee, Karim, & Chang, 2008). However, fear of re-
injury is an important psychological factor for
athletes not returning to sport, especially for those
who have sustained a severe injury (Chimielewski
et al., 2008; Kvist et al., 2005; Lee et al., 2008).
Increased fear of movement of an injured anatomical
site could have a negative effect on the efficacy of
exercise treatment and hence on rehabilitation and
recovery (Silbernagel, Brorsson, & Lundberg, 2011).
Athletes who reported a career-ending injury ex-
pressed significantly lower levels of life satisfaction
than their non-injured counterparts (Kleiber &
Brock, 1992; Petitpas & Danish, 1995). However,
other studies, such as that by Perna et al. (1999),
have concluded that athletes with a severe athletic
injury were no less satisfied with their lives than non-
injured or moderately injured athletes. In this study
we did not investigate the effects of the injury on self-
esteem or life satisfaction. However, many athletes
reported decreased motivation as an important
reason to end their sport career alongside their
injury. One reason for loss of motivation may be
the length of the rehabilitation process. It may not
have been effective or may have taken a long time,
and in consequence prevented the athlete from fully
participating in training and competitions. More-
over, many athletes find that they are unable to
return to their previous physical activity level (Ny-
land, Johnson, Caborn, & Brindle, 2002) and are
therefore dissatisfied. It is possible that such athletes
may have overly high or unrealistic expectations of
the effects surgery for a severe injury will have and
therefore are not mentally prepared for the post-
operative demands of rehabilitation (Dekker,
Groothoff, van der Sluis, Eisma, & Ten Duis,
2003; Thomee et al., 2006).
It may also be that gender and other factors such
as embarking on further education may influence the
decision to terminate a career in sport. It may be
hard to combine a strict training regime with
academic studies, and if an athlete’s performance
has been impaired as a result of injury, choosing to
be educated for an alternative occupation in later life
is understandable. It is also natural for athletes to
want to have a family and children. For female
athletes this means absence from sport during
pregnancy, while after having a child only a few
female athletes retain sufficient enthusiasm toSport injuries as the main cause of sport career termination 7
continue their sport career at the top level. In our
study, all the terminating athletes reported that
injury was the main reason for quitting their sport
career. However, because the reasons were the
subjective opinions of the athletes themselves we
cannot be sure that they wholly explain their early
retirement from professional sport.
According to Gabbe, Finch, Bennell, and
Wajswelner (2003) recall accuracy declines as the
level of detail requested increases. However, termi-
nating a sport career is such a ‘‘big thing’’ in an
athlete’s life that it is unlikely to be forgotten. A
further strength of this study was the telephone
interview by semi-structured questionnaire, which
gave more specific information about the reasons for
ending a sport career. The response rate to the postal
questionnaire was low and it is to be considered a
limitation in this study. Because of the low number
of career-ending athletes there was insufficient power
to perform many statistical analyses.
Conclusion
We found that sports injuries play a significant role in
terminating a career in sport, and, in some sports
events, injuries may commonly be the main reason
for sport career termination. Injury prevention and
adequate treatment and rehabilitation of the injuries
are thus essential to avoid the long-term conse-
quences of severe sport injuries.
