Context: Visually impaired athletes sustain overuse injuries
in the lower limbs, but the pattern of injuries may vary according
to the sport. The characteristics of sports injuries in visually
impaired swimmers are unknown.
Objective: To determine the characteristics and epidemio-
logic measures (prevalence, clinical incidence, and incidence
rate) of sports injuries in visually impaired elite nationalswimmers and to assess differences among visual classesand between sexes.
Design: Descriptive epidemiology study.
Setting: International Paralympic competitions held be-
tween 2004 and 2008.
Patients or Other Participants: Twenty-eight elite, visually
impaired swimmers (19 males, 9 females) from the Brazilian
Paralympic Team participated in this study. Twelve were visualclass S11 (blind swimmers), 12 were S12 (low-vision swim-
mers), and 4 were S13 (low-vision swimmers).
Intervention(s): A standardized report form was used to
collect data during 5 competitions. This was endorsed by 2Brazilian sports governing bodies.
Main Outcome Measures: The characteristics, prevalence,
clinical incidence, and incidence rate of injuries were calculated.Results: Eighteen athletes reported 41 sports injuries, with
a prevalence of 64%, clinical incidence of 1.5 injuries perathlete, and an incidence rate of 0.3 injuries per athlete percompetition. Overuse injuries (80%) were more frequent thantraumatic injuries (20%). The clinical incidence and prevalencevaried according to sex and visual class, but no statisticaldifferences were observed ( P..05). The highest proportion of
injuries was in the trunk (46.34%), followed by the upper limbs(34.15%). The shoulders (29.27%) were most affected, followedby the thoracic (21.95%) and lumbar spine (17.07%). Spasm(36.59%) was the most frequent diagnosis, followed bytendinopathy (26.83%).
Conclusions: Visually impaired swimmers had a relatively
high proportion of overuse injuries, predominantly associatedwith muscle spasm in the spine and tendinopathy in theshoulders. No differences were apparent in injury prevalence
and clinical incidence among visual classes or betweensexes.

Key Points
/C15Visually impaired swimmers experienced a relatively high proportion of overuse injuries during competition.
/C15Injuries were predominantly associated with muscle spasm in the spine and tendinopathy in the shoulders.
/C15No differences were observed in injury prevalence or clinical incidence among visual classes or between sexes.
Swimming was ﬁrst introduced to the Paralympic
Games in Rome, Italy, in 1960. It is a multidisabilitysport in which athletes with physical, motor, visual,
and intellectual impairments compete across a range ofimpairment classiﬁcations.
1Visually impaired athletes
must be formally evaluated by an ophthalmologist todetermine their visual classiﬁcation (ie, the degree ofimpairment). Athletes are categorized in 1 of 3 levels: S11(from no light perception in either eye up to light
perception, unable to recognize the shape of a hand at
any distance or direction); S12 (from ability to recognizethe shape of a hand up to a visual acuity of 20/600 or avisual ﬁeld of less than 5 8in the best eye with the best
practical eye correction); S13 (from visual acuity above 20/600 to 20/200 or a visual ﬁeld of less than 20 8and more
than 58in the best eye with the best correction).
2Athletes in
the S11 visual class mus t wear opaque goggles to
standardize light perception in competition, negating anypotential advantage over athletes who do not have residual
vision.1
In Paralympic sports, the large variety of disabilities,
sports modalities, and sports classiﬁcation systems creates asigniﬁcant challenge for those studying the epidemiology ofsports injuries.
3,4The characteristics of sports injuries
appear to depend on the nature of disability and the sport,but most of the published studies adopt a cross-disabilityresearch design, leading to problems in data interpretation,particularly because different disabilities and sports maymanifest in different injury patterns.
4Sports injuries are
also associated with numerous risk factors that are usuallyclassiﬁed as extrinsic (eg, sport, rules, climate, surface,equipment) or intrinsic (eg, body composition, age, sex,ﬂexibility, strength, balance, proprioception), with manyintrinsic risk factors considered modiﬁable.
5With regard to
Paralympic sports, the disability must be considered anintrinsic risk factor that cannot be modiﬁed.

The practice of competitive sports predisposes all
individuals to sports injuries, irrespective of disability.
Epidemiologic studies related to sports injuries are
therefore important: to allow prospective participants to
make informed choices about involvement based on the risk
of injury; to provide information for medical and health
care professionals to ensure care in disability sport; and to
direct researchers, practitioners, and administrators to
develop preventive strategies and create a safe environment
for participation.3
It is well documented that visually impaired athletes
sustain more injuries in the lower limbs and that the most
common injuries are tendinopathy, strain, and contusion.7–9
In general, Paralympic swimming is considered a low-risksport.
10Unfortunately, to date, few authors have investi-
gated and reported injuries by sport and disability type, and
published studies do not therefore reveal the true pattern
and nature of injuries in elite, visually impaired swimmers.
The aim of this study is to determine the characteristics and
epidemiologic measures (prevalence and clinical incidence)
of sports injuries in elite, visually impaired national
swimmers and to assess differences among visual classes
and between sexes.
METHODS
This was a descriptive, observational epidemiologic
study of sports-related injuries in elite, visually impaired
Brazilian swimmers. Ethical approval was obtained from
the University of Campinas Research Ethics Committee.
The Brazilian Paralympic Committee (CPB) and the
Brazilian Confederation of Sport for Blind Athletes
(CBDC) gave permission for access to athletes and medical
records for the purposes of this study.
Participants
Twenty-eight athletes (19 males, 9 females) with visual
disability gave informed consent to participate in this study.
Twelve athletes were classiﬁed as S11 (blind swimmers), 12
as S12 (low-vision swimmers), and 4 as S13 (low-vision
swimmers). All athletes represented the Brazilian Swimming
Team in international competitions between 2004 and 2008.
Their participation varied depending on squad selection for
each event. The form was administrated during the following
competitions: Paralympic Games 2004 (Greece), Interna-
tional Blind Sports Federation Pan-American Games 2005
(Brazil), International Blind Sports Federation World
Championship 2007 (Brazil), Para Pan-American Games
2007 (Brazil), and Paralympic Games 2008 (China).Definition of Terms
Areportable injury was deﬁned as any injury that caused
an athlete to stop, limit, or modify participation for 1 ormore days.
8To standardize the location of injury, the body
was divided into the following segments and regions: head
(head, face); upper limb (shoulder, arm, elbow, forearm,wrist, hand, ﬁngers); lower limb (hip, thigh, knee, lowerleg, ankle, feet), and trunk (spine, abdomen, rib cage). The
mechanism of injury was determined as traumatic (resulting
from a speciﬁc, identiﬁable event) or overuse (caused byrepeated microtrauma without a single identiﬁable eventresponsible for the injury).
10
Epidemiologic measures (prevalence, clinical incidence,
and incidence rate) were evaluated. Prevalence is deﬁned
as the proportion of athletes who have an existing injury at
any given point in time; it is calculated by dividing the
number of injured athletes by the number of athletesexposed at the speciﬁed time.
11,12Clinical incidence is
deﬁned by using the number of injuries as the numerator
and the number of athletes at risk as the denominator.11
Incidence rate is the number of injuries divided by the total
person-time at risk (athlete-exposures).11In this study, the
athlete-exposure is represented by competition and year.
Injury Report Form
A standardized injury report form, used routinely by the
CPB and CBDC, required documentation of the following
information: athlete name, age, sex, visual classiﬁcation,sport, event, injured body part, and mechanism anddiagnosis of injury. During the competitions, the multidis-
ciplinary Brazilian medical team consisted of orthopaedists,
physiotherapists, and nurses. The orthopaedists determinedthe precise diagnosis of each sports-related injury, afterwhich athletes were referred to a physiotherapist. Sports
injuries that occurred outside the period of competition
were not recorded. When an athletes suffered a recurrentinjury, the injury was counted only once.
Statistical Analysis
All data were collated using Excel 2007 (Microsoft
Corporation, Redmond, WA) and analyzed using SPSS
14.0 (SPSS, IBM Brazil Ltd, Sao Paulo, Brazil). Descrip-
tive statistics were calculated and used to determine thetotal and relative frequency of injuries. The Shapiro-Wilktest was conducted to determine the normality of data
distribution. Where the normality of data distribution could
be assumed, a 1-way analysis of variance test wasperformed. Alternatively, the Kruskal-Wallis test was usedTable 1. Number of Participating Athletes, Injured Athletes, and Injuries by Visual Class and Sex in Each Swimming Competition

to assess differences among visual classes and between
sexes. The level of signiﬁcance was set a priori at P,.05.
RESULTS
Of the 28 athletes, 18 sustained a total of 41 sports
injuries (Table 1), giving a prevalence of 64%. Descriptive
data on the prevalence and clinical incidence in each
competition, also presented by visual class and sex, are
provided in Table 2. The overall clinical incidence was 1.5
injuries per athlete. The incidence rate was 0.3 injuries per
athlete per competition.
With regard to sex, the injury prevalence was slightly
higher in female compared with male swimmers (Table 2),
but this was not statistically signiﬁcant ( P¼.12). Similarly,
the clinical incidence was higher in male compared with
female swimmers (Table 2), but again, not signiﬁcantly ( P
¼.16). With regard to visual class, S13 athletes presented a
higher prevalence of injury, followed by S11 and S12
athletes ( P¼.18). The clinical incidence in S11 athletes
was higher, followed by S13 and S12 athletes ( P¼.1; Table
2). No statistical differences were found between subgroups
(P..05).
With regard to the mechanism of injury (Figure 1), of 41
injuries, 33 were overuse injuries (80%). The frequency and
distribution of injuries by body segment (Figure 2) reveal
that the trunk sustained 46.34% of injuries, mostly in the
spine (43.9%), followed by the upper limbs, lower limbs,
and head.
The frequency of injuries in each anatomical region
(Figure 3) showed that the proportion of shoulder injuries
was greater than the proportion of injuries to the thoracic
and lumbar spine.
The frequency of sports injuries also varied by diagnosis
(Figure 4), with the greatest frequencies reported as spasm
(36.59%) and tendinopathy (26.83%).
DISCUSSION
Although not statistically signiﬁcant, a trend for the
prevalence of injury to be higher in S13 swimmers (100%),
followed by S11 (75%) and S12 (42%) was noted, but the
clinical incidence was higher in S11 (2.3 injuries per
athlete) and S13 (2.0 injuries per athlete) swimmers,
compared with S12 (0.5 injuries per athlete) swimmers
(Table 2). These trends are worthy of further investigation
with larger cohorts. In this group, a larger number of S13
athletes was injured, but S11 athletes presented with a
greater number of injuries per athlete, resulting in a
complex relationship between visual class and injury.Magno e Silva et al6analyzed a group of 131 visually
impaired athletes in different sports and found that athletes
with less visual function had a higher prevalence of injury.
It is also noteworthy that swimmers in the classes with
better vision delivered the best performances.13,14
The sport-speciﬁc demands of swimming improve
performance and yet simultaneously reduce shoulder
stability (increased shoulder range of motion; increased
internal rotation and adduction strength; and prolonged,
fatiguing, shoulder-intensive training), which can predis-
pose individuals to injury.15As the current study did not
evaluate other external factors such as training load, we
cannot be more conclusive about the factors affecting injury
outcomes.
We observed an overall injury prevalence of 64%, and
the group sustained a clinical incidence of 1.5 injuries per
athlete, indicating that some athletes sustained multiple
injuries.11These results are similar to results reported by
Reynolds et al,16who found that on the British Paralympic
swimming team during the Paralympic Games of Barcelona
(1992), of 43 athletes (multidisability), 69% were injured.
In Olympic17and Paralympic4sports, swimming is
generally considered a low-risk sport when compared with
other activities. Magno e Silva et al18observed that blind
elite footballers presented a clinical incidence of 2.7
injuries per athlete during a 4-year period of observation,
including 5 competitions and 23 matches.
Our results demonstrated a similar value when we
compared injury by sex. Female athletes (67%) had a
slightly higher prevalence than male athletes (63%), but
this was not signiﬁcantly different ( P¼.12). MaleTable 2. Prevalence and Clinical Incidence by Visual Class and Sex in Each Swimming Competition

swimmers (1.6 injuries per athlete) had a slightly greater
clinical incidence when compared with female swimmers
(1.1 injuries per athlete), but again, no statistical difference
was found ( P¼.16). Thus, in this group, a large proportion
of female athletes were injured, but male athletes incurred
more injuries per athlete. In collegiate swimmers without
disability, Wolf et al19found an injury prevalence of 72.7%
in male and 70% in female athletes. Indeed, the pattern of
injuries between men and women seems to shows few
differences compared with the same sport among able-
bodied athletes.20Knowles21suggested that female athletes
have a lower overall rate of injury when compared with
male athletes without disability. Further authors should be
encouraged to evaluate the risk of injury by sex in larger
Paralympic sport cohorts.
In relation to the injury mechanism (Figure 1), we
observed that overuse injuries (80%) were more frequent
than traumatic injuries (20%). The prevalence of overuse
injuries in athletes with disability has been described in
previous studies6,8,9but not in relation to speciﬁc sports.
Mountjoy et al22also described a frequency of 35% overuse
injuries when evaluating sports injuries in 5 aquatic sports.
It is estimated that an able-bodied collegiate swimmer
performs an average of more than 1 million strokes per arm
per year23; however, training loads among Paralympic
swimmers are unknown. In visually impaired swimmers,
the prevalence of overuse injuries may be inherently relatedto the sport, particularly the repetitive movements of arm
strokes, rather than the disability. Some traumatic injuries
did occur in this sample, and it is possible that these injuries
were related to the swimmer’s speciﬁc visual incapacity,
particularly the inability to see the line lanes and the edges
of the pool. This resulted in traumatic injuries such as
contusion, lacerations, and abrasions (Figure 4). The risk of
colliding with obstacles, among visually impaired athletes,
may increase feelings of apprehension and anxiety and may
be a factor that inﬂuences performance.13
A study of Brazilian Paralympic swimmers (multidis-
ability) revealed that the upper limbs accounted for 44.4%
of injuries, followed by the spine (38.9%) and lower limbs
(16.7%). The body parts most affected were shoulders
(29.2%) and cervical (16.7%) and thoracic (12.5%) spines,
and the most frequent injury diagnoses were tendinopathy
(36%) and spinal pain (36%).24In our research, the thoracic
spine was the most affected region (22.95%), mainly by
muscular spasms caused by overuse in the paravertebral
and scapular stabilizer muscles that are generally over-
loaded in swimming biomechanics.15,23,25Nyland et al9
observed a higher prevalence of injury in the cervicotho-
racic spine (19%) of visually impaired athletes, without
speciﬁcation of sport, and related the number of injuries to
the need to suddenly respond to auditory or tactile cues for
movement correction. Swimming athletes without disability
also presented with a high number of musculoskeletal

injuries in the cervical and thoracic spine.22,26Goldstein et
al27noted that in a group of female swimmers, 15.8% had
spine abnormalities. We hypothesize that the relatively high
prevalence of injuries in this area is related more to the
mechanics of swimming and to the rotational movement of
the head during breathing than to the disability type. The
lumbar spine was the third most injured body part in this
study (Figure 3). Compared with other athletes, swimmers
often present with a greater lumbar curvature; furthermore,
the butterﬂy and breast strokes predispose athletes to pain
in this anatomical region.26We did not evaluate sport
injuries according to the stroke style. However, it would
seem logical that the stroke style is one extrinsic factor that
can be related to the development of a sport injury, and this
needs to be considered in further epidemiologic studies of
Paralympic swimming.
In the upper limbs, the body part with the greatest injury
frequency was the shoulder (Figure 3), which was mainly
related to rotator cuff tendinopathy. In able-bodied
swimmers, the shoulder is also the body part most
frequently affected by injury.15,22,23,26Wolf et al19found
that the shoulder accounted for 31% of injuries in collegiate
swimmers without disability. In swimming, both the upper
and lower limbs are used to generate a propulsion force
through the water,23,28but close to 90% of the propulsion is
generated by the upper limbs.25It would appear that most
shoulder pain is caused by instability stemming from
demands that are speciﬁc to the sport of swimming.15
Various anatomical regions of the lower limbs were also
affected by injuries, the feet being the most prone to
contusions and lacerations (Figures 3 and 4). These injuries
can be related to errors of judgment, particularly during the
turn, or to direct contact with the lane line. Thigh injuries
were predominantly related to muscle spasms, whereas the
knees were mainly affected by tendinopathy (Figures 3 and
4). Swimming is a noncontact and non–weight-bearing
sport29: knee pain and knee injuries generally occur because
of repetitive movement (ie, overuse), particularly in athletes
who perform breaststroke. Rodeo30referred to other studies
with non–visually impaired athletes, in which the preva-
lence of knee injury varied between 27% and 75%.
One important observation from our study was that no
reported injuries affected the head region (Figure 2). This
suggests that use of a tapper may be an effective method of
avoiding trauma to the head and face. All visually impairedathletes (S11, S12, and S13) are permitted the assistance of
a support staff person, the tapper, who indicates to the
swimmer the approach to the end of the pool, touching the
athlete with sensorial information.1
To our knowledge, we are the ﬁrst to report on the
prevalence, clinical incidence, incidence rate, mechanisms,
and distribution of sports injuries among elite, visually
impaired swimmers. Although the sample size is relatively
small, it includes all available elite swimmers representing
Brazil throughout a 4-year period of observation and
highlights the unique risks associated with this sport. In
conclusion, Brazilian Paralympic swimmers with visual
impairment were predominantly affected by overuse
injuries. The trunk was the most affected body segment,
followed by the upper limbs and lower limbs. More
speciﬁcally, the shoulders and the cervical and thoracic
spine were the body areas most affected by injuries. The
most frequent diagnoses were spasm and tendinopathy.
Female and male athletes presented similar prevalence and
clinical incidence values. With respect to visual class, S13
athletes showed a higher prevalence of injuries, but S11
athletes had a higher clinical incidence. These results
suggest that injury-prevention strategies in elite, visually
impaired swimmers should focus on managing training
loads to prevent overuse injuries. To prevent traumatic
injuries, strategies should be developed to further assist
athletes in gauging their position relative to the lane end,
preventing traumatic contact injuries such as contusions
and lacerations.
Further research should aim to quantify training loads,
overall athlete-exposures, and other extrinsic factors that
can be related to sports injuries. This requires a strategic
approach to optimize the capture and analysis of data
related to intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors, which
ultimately requires the development of an electronic
database system. This will allow all practitioners to enter
and manage sports injury data from different athletes,
teams, and locations.
