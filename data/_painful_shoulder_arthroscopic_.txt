Shoulder pain is the most common musculo-skeletal com-
plaint in competitive swimmers. It remains one of the
shoulder pain syndromes in overhead athletes where no
golden standard of treatment exists. Eighteen competitive
swimmers who all had undergone shoulder arthroscopy for
therapy-resistant shoulder pain were retrospectively evalu-
ated with respect to operative ﬁndings and ability to return
to their sport after the operation.
The most common ﬁnding at arthroscopy was labral
pathology in 11 (61%) and subacromial impingement
in ﬁve shoulders (28%). Operative procedures inclu-
ded debridement in 11 swimmers, partial release ofthe coraco-acromial ligament in four, and bursectomy
in four.
Sixteen (89%) responded to the follow-up evaluation.
Nine swimmers (56%) were able to compete at preinjury
level after 4 (2–9) months.
Findings at arthroscopy suggest that the term ‘‘Swim-
mer’s shoulder’’ covers a variety of pathologies including
labral wearing and subacromial impingement. Arthroscopic
debridement of labral tears or bursectomy in swimmers with
shoulder pain has a low success rate with regard to return to
sport. Further understanding and investigation of this
syndromes complex pathophysiology is needed.
Shoulder pain is a common complaint among over-
head athletes, including swimmers. Among elite-level
swimmers, the prevalence is reported to be from 15%
to 80% (Ciullo, 1986; Bak et al., 1989; McMaster &
Troup, 1993). Various rehabilitation protocols in-
cluding rest, stretching, and strengthening have been
reported (Allegrucci et al., 1994; Kenal & Knapp,
1996; Russ, 1998); however, the evidence of eﬀective-
ness is not clear. In cases resistant to rehabilitation,
arthroscopy has been reported to be a diagnostic and
surgical option (Eriksson & Denti, 1985; McMaster,
1986; Biedert & Kentsch, 1989; Weldon & Richard-
son, 2001).
Swimmer’s shoulder was originally thought to be
synonyms with coraco-acromial impingement (Ken-
nedy & Hawkins, 1974) due to outlet stenosis. Later
studies have shown that dysfunction of the ligamen-
tous and muscular stabilizers around the shoulder
might contribute to etiology. Rupp et al. (1995), who
clinically evaluated 22 elite-level swimmers, found a
positive apprehension test as a sign of antero-inferior
instability in 50%, dysfunction of the scapulothor-
acic joint in 55%, and signiﬁcant muscular imbalance
of the rotator cuﬀ internal and external rotators
compared with non-swimmers. Fifty percent of the
swimmers showed positive impingement sign. Bakand Faunø (1997) examined 36 elite-level swimmers
with 49 painful shoulders and found almost similar
results with a positive apprehensions test in 43%, a
positive impingement test in 80%, and signs of
scapulothoracic dysfunction in 33%. Furthermore,
they found concomitant signs of impingement and
antero-inferior hyperlaxity in 51%.
The understanding of shoulder joint pathology has
improved with the use of arthroscopy. Swimmers and
overhead athletes might suﬀer from the same injuries
as a result of a similar movement pattern in the
shoulder. Arthroscopic ﬁndings include rugged lab-
rum, superior labral anterior to posterior (SLAP)
lesions, bursal-side tear of the supraspinatus tendon,
impingement of the posterior rotator cuﬀ, and in-
ﬂammation of the long head of the biceps tendon
(Eriksson & Denti, 1985; McMaster, 1986; Hurley &
Anderson, 1990; Paley et al., 2000)
Surgical treatment of swimmer’s shoulder has
included distal clavicle resection, coraco-acromial
ligament resection, debridement, and decompression,
with poor return rates (Tibone et al., 1985; Jobe &
Glousman, 1991; Albertsson et al., 1992).
The purpose of the present study was to describe
operative ﬁndings after arthroscopy of swimmers’
painful shoulder, and to evaluate the outcome ofScand J Med Sci Sports 2007: 17: 373–377 COPYRIGHT &BLACKWELL MUNKSGAARD 2006

arthroscopic treatment with regard to the rate of
return to sport.
Materials and method
A retrospective analysis of 18 swimmers, who had an arthro-
scopy of their shoulder from 1992 to 2000, was undertaken.
There were 16 competitive swimmers up to national level. One
was a master swimmer, and one was a water-polo player. At
the beginning of the recruiting period, two of the authors
(author K. B. and P. F.) were national team doctors. Inclusion
criteria were that the swimmers had their shoulder examined
by one of these two doctors once during the recruiting period
because of shoulder pain, and subsequently underwent arthro-
scopy of their shoulder. The most common favorite stroke was
freestyle (nine swimmers). The median age at operation was
18 (15–34) years. Sixteen of the 18 swimmers were between
16 and 22 years old. The swimmers had symptoms before
the operation for an average of 23 (8–48) months and all
had undergone physiotherapeutic rehabilitation for at least
6 months before operation. In one case, a history of minor
shoulder trauma in a water shoot was noted (Swimmer # 8,
Table 1). For patient data, see Table 1.
Patient records were reviewed with respect to ﬁndings
during arthroscopy. Telephone interviews were conducted by
one author (C. B.) in order to evaluate the functional outcome
of the operation. The swimmers were asked whether they wereable to return to swimming, at which level they were able to
return, and how long a period of rehabilitation was needed
before the return. If the swimmers did not return to swimming,
they were asked whether they had quit swimming due to
persistent symptoms or for other reasons. The interviews were
conducted on average 4 years and 2 months (2–8 years) after
the operation.
Results
Out of 18 swimmers, it was possible to interview
16 (89%) – two swimmers could not be located in the
register of telephone numbers. The most common
ﬁnding at arthroscopy was labral pathology in
11 (61%) shoulders. Of these, ﬁve had signs of poster-
ior superior impingement (PSI), two in combination
with subacromial impingement. Six had labral tears,
of whom two had a SLAP lesion, and one had an
incomplete Bankart lesion. The second most common
ﬁnding was subacromial impingement ( n55, 28%),
of whom two also had PSI. Two swimmers had
isolated inﬂammation of the long head of the biceps
tendon, and one had diﬀuse synovitis. In one
shoulder, no pathological ﬁndings were seen.

The most common operative procedure was deb-
ridement ( n511), followed by partial release of the
coraco-acromial ligament ( n54), and bursectomy
(n54) (Table 1). Nine swimmers (56%) returned to
their preinjury level, seven (44%) without shoulder
pain, and two (12%) with some shoulder pain. Seven
(44%) never returned to competitive swimming, six
of these (38%) due to shoulder pain. The median
time to return to swimming activity at the preinjury
level was 4 (2–9) months.
In the group of swimmers who had only debride-
ment performed, four of eight (50%) returned to
swimming, whereas one of the four swimmers (25%)
in the group with release of the coraco-acromial
ligament was able to return. All the swimmers in
the latter group had coraco-acromial impingement,
whereas none of the swimmers in the debridement
group had this diagnosis.
Discussion
The ﬁrst purpose of this study was to describe the
arthroscopic ﬁndings in swimmers’ shoulder. Our
results support other studies of overhead athletes
that painful swimmers’ shoulders display a variety of
diﬀerent pathologies (Kennedy & Hawkins, 1974;
McMaster 1986, 1999; Liu & Boynton, 1993; Bak,
1996; Bak & Faunø, 1997).
The second purpose of this study was to evaluate
the return rate to competitive swimming after the
operation. The overall return rate was 56%, and
44% returned to their previous level of performance
without pain. We noted that only one of the swim-
mers who had partial release of their coracoacromial
ligament (CAL) was able to return to swimming. It
seems therefore that isolated coraco-acromial impin-
gement is not present in swimmers, and that other
shoulder dysfunction is responsible for continuous
discomfort. Underlying hyperlaxity or scapular dys-
kinesis that has not been corrected may explain these
poor results. We are aware of the reservations of
scientiﬁc limitations of a retrospective study.
Other studies have evaluated the outcome after
diﬀerent kinds of operations in athlete shoulders.
Tibone et al. (1985) evaluated 35 shoulders with pain
mainly due to non-traumatic overhead activity.
Anterior acromioplasty was conducted, returning
only 44% to competitive sport. The low return rate
to sport in this study led to new thoughts about the
etiology of impingement in overhead athletes. Al-
bertsson et al. (1992) evaluated the procedure of an
open resection of the coraco-acromial ligament in
25 shoulders of mainly overhead athletes, 40% being
swimmers. Before the injury, 23 were athletes at a
competitive level, and the operation returned
12 (50%) to this level.Arthroscopic subacromial decompression in over-
head athletes has been evaluated by Jobe and Glous-
man (1991) and McConville and Ianotti (1999), who
found return rates of around 50% with poorer results
for swimmers. Studies on labral debridement in
overhead athletes show that this procedure has a
poor outcome too with respect to return rate to
competitive sport (Altchek et al., 1992; Tomlinson
& Glousman, 1995), and support our ﬁndings in this
study conducted on swimmers.
There are many possible explanations for the low
success rate. One is that new concepts of overhead
athletes’ shoulder pain syndromes leads to new
diﬀerentiation in the treatment strategies, phy-
siotherapeutic as well as surgical. There is increasing
interest in the role of scapular dyskinesis and subtle
gleno-humeral instability in the development of
shoulder pain in overhead athletes (Bak, 1996;
Kvitne et al., 1995; Meister, 2000; Altchek & Hobbs,
2001; Kibler et al., 2001; Burkhart et al., 2003).
Scapular dyskinesis is thought to take part in a
large number of shoulder injuries and is probably
caused by an inhibition in the activation patterns of
the scapula stabilizing muscles. The dyskinesis pre-
sents as a dyssynchronic movement of the two
scapulas, where the involved scapula is placed in
an abducted, protracted, and laterally displaced
position where both external and internal impinge-
ment is more likely to occur (Burkhart et al., 2003).
Increased protraction furthermore leads to hyperan-
gulation of the gleno-humeral joint increasing
the stress on the anterior–inferior capsule. In addi-
tion, associated gleno-humeral internal rotational
deﬁcit (GIRD) may further aggravate capsular
hyperlaxity (Burkhart et al., 2003). Scapular dyskin-
esis in elite-level swimmers was found by Bak and
Faunø (1997) and Rupp et al. (1995) in 33–55% of
the cases.
Excessive gleno-humeral translation (hyperlaxity)
in swimmers is found both in symptomatic (Bak &
Faunø, 1997) and asymptomatic (Tibone et al., 2002)
individuals. It is not clear whether this hyperlaxity is
a part of inborn joint hypermobility or is acquired
during the wear of the labrum during the swim stroke
(Zemek & Magee, 1996). The excessive translation is
thought to place the humerus in a position where
pain is more likely to occur (Jobe et al., 1989; Belling
et al., 2000).
Attempts to correct underlying gleno-humeral
joint hyperlaxity by surgery have been made includ-
ing capsular shift procedures and thermal shrinkage.
Inferior capsular shift procedures have been reported
with good outcome. In athletes participating in
diﬀerent kinds of sports, Bigliani et al. (1994) eval-
uated 63 shoulders with a return rate of 75%, and
Pollock et al. (2000) evaluated 49 shoulders with a
return rate to the previous level of 69% among theSwimmers’ painful shoulder
375
36 athletes. In overhead athletes and swimmers, the
return rate to the competitive level is highly depen-
dent on the degree of external rotation after surgery.
Bak et al. (2000) evaluated 26 shoulders with a return
rate of 76% among the 21 overhead athletes. Com-
pared with the non-operated shoulder, they found
the same degree of external rotation in 92% of the
patients after operation. These reports all include a
high number of shoulders with dislocations and
traumatic instability, which is not the case in swim-
mers. Rubinstein et al. (1992) reported on a large
series of 76 athletes treated with anterior capsulo-
labral reconstruction, where the majority returned to
previous sport. Sixty-nine of these had never had a
dislocating event. Instability was most commonly
subtle, and activity-related pain was the predominant
symptom.
Previous reports on thermal shrinkage or cap-
sular shifts procedures have been performed in
heterogeneous groups concerning sports discip-
line and trauma/non-trauma (Levitz et al., 2001;
Reinold et al., 2003; Enad et al., 2004). Therefore,
the concept of addressing the laxity this way in
swimmers is still not well documented. New
understanding of the importance of the concept
of prevention and rehabilitation aiming at both
rotator cuﬀ and scapular-stabilizing training
(Burkhart et al., 2003) might improve the
non-operative treatment of swimmer’s shoulder.
Stabilizing procedures with correction of associa-
ted labral pathology may be the future solution
in cases with signs of subtle gleno-humeral instability
where scapular and cuﬀ rehabilitation is without
eﬀect.Conclusions
1. Arthroscopy of swimmers with shoulder pain
resistant to rehabilitation predominantly reveals
labral pathology and signs of subacromial im-
pingement.
2. The return rate to preinjury sport level after
labral debridement and bursectomy in competi-
tive swimmers is 56% in this study.
Perspectives
Shoulder pain is a common musculo-skeletal com-
plaint in competitive swimmers. Clinical ﬁndings
vary, and no clear-cut diagnostic entity exists. Treat-
ment must be directed toward underlying pathology.
Experience suggests that rehabilitation of the rotator
cuﬀ and improvement of scapular kinesis may pre-
vent most cases. Technical and training errors might
be causes of shoulder pain, and intervention studies
with a focus on this are desirable.
Reports of surgical procedures for swimmer’s
shoulder have a low success rate. Stabilizing proce-
dures, which have shown encouraging results in other
categories of overhead athletes regarding return rate
and performance, may be the solution in cases with
signs of subtle gleno-humeral instability where scap-
ular and cuﬀ rehabilitation is without eﬀect.
Swimmer’s shoulder is a complex diagnostic entity
with a multifactorial etiology and pathophysiology
including scapular dyskinesis, gleno-humeral joint
hyperlaxity, and internal impingement.
Key words: swimmers shoulder, arthroscopic ﬁndings,
outcome, labral pathology, treatment, debridement.
