INTRODUCTION
China’s swimming events have achieved outstanding results in various 
competitions in the world. In addition, swimming has a high degree of 
participation. With the popularization of relevant knowledge and teaching 
information, swimming can help college students’ physical functions. 
Therefore, this sport is very popular among college students. Swimming 
is a skill type sport that requires great physical strength.1 With the deve -
lopment of the project, college students have a deeper understanding 
of the importance of training links. The training effect is reflected in the 
process of swimming through organ function, body shape, technical 
ability and physical health. The purpose of college students’ training is 
to improve their physical quality, so as to improve their sports ability.2 
As the most important ability in swimming, physical ability plays a very 
important role in training. With the continuous innovation and impro -
vement of China’s swimming training system, more scientific training 
methods have been adopted by college students.3 Moreover, physical 
fitness provides the most basic guarantee for all technical movements. 
Excellent physical ability can enable college students to better complete 
technical movements. At the same time, making efficient physical training 
plans for college students can provide more convenient conditions for 
the skills teaching link later. Moreover, swimming is a dangerous sport. In 
many accident cases, sports accidents due to insufficient physical strength 
account for a large proportion. Therefore, physical training is the basis 
for college students to swim.4 Physical training can comprehensively 
improve college students’ sports ability and sports level. Help college 
students complete skill training more efficiently. In addition, physical 
training should focus on all-round training, instead of developing uni -
lateral physical strength. The comprehensive physical quality of college 
students can be effectively improved through various physical training 
to enhance their group sports experience.5 Based on the above reasons, 
this paper takes a college student as the research object to explore the 
effect of physical training on their swimming skill teaching.
METHOD
In this paper, 40 college students who are not specialized in physical 
education in a university were selected and divided into two groups ac -
cording to the form of random sampling. The study and all the participants 
were reviewed and approved by Ethics Committee of Jiangsu University 
(NO.2019JSUI062). Details are as shows in Table 1, and P> 0.05 indicating 
that there is no significant difference in the classification of this lottery.
This paper adopts the method of controlled experiment. The two 
groups of college students are divided into experimental group and 
control group, each group has 18 people, and the whole experiment 
period is 12 weeks. During the period, the experimental group trained 
according to the physical training set by the researchers, three times a week, each time including 10 minutes of stretching training, 45 
minutes of physical training and 10 minutes of relaxation training, 
a total of 65 minutes. The control group simply completed some 
swimming physical training in the form of repeatedly waving hands 
and lifting legs on the land according to the teaching of swimming in 
traditional physical education classes. In terms of venue selection, the 
observation of physical fitness change and sports injury prevention of 
college students is carried out in the indoor gymnasium on the land, 
so as to prevent the impact of the external climate environment on 
college students’ sports performance. The observation of changes 
in swimming skills is carried out in the swimming pool. Before the 
beginning of the experiment and after the 12 week experiment, the 
above indicators of students were observed uniformly, and their data 
were collated and analyzed.
RESULTS
Improvement of physical fitness of college students by 
physical training
Table 2 shows the influence of physical training on college students’ 
physical fitness. Although these physical abilities are measured on land 
and have no direct connection with swimming, they can indirectly re -
flect the physical quality of students, thus proving the effect of existing 
physical training.
It can be seen from Table 2 that in the course of 12 weeks, both 
the experimental group and the control group have achieved a certain 
improvement in physical fitness. During the 12 weeks, other sports 
training and simple skill teaching training in the classroom will be 
carried out, so there is a certain relationship between the physical 
improvement of the control group and its presence. In addition to 
the regular physical education teaching, the physical fitness train -
ing of the experimental group also has the unique physical fitness 
training effect. It can be seen from the comparison between the two 
groups that the control group also achieved a certain improvement 
in 12 weeks, P < 0.05, indicating that there is a significant difference, 
which proves that other daily sports have a certain impact on the 
physical quality of students. However, the improvement range of the 
control group is far less than that of the experimental group, which 
shows that the physical training effect of the experimental group 
is far greater than that of the control group, which also proves that 
targeted physical training in swimming teaching can better improve 
the physical quality of students.
Prevention of physical training on college students’ 
swimming injury
Table 3 shows the changes of college students’ FMS test scores 
before and after physical training In the process of physical education 
teaching for ordinary college students, the prevention of sports injuries is 
the focus of many teachers. If sports injuries are caused in the process of 
sports training, it will affect students’ enthusiasm for sports and teaching 
effect, which will have a negative impact on students’ bodies and cause 
teaching accidents. Therefore, in this section, the prevention effect of Table 1. Basic information analysis of two groups of College Students.

Rev Bras Med Esporte – 2023; Vol. 29 – e2022_0690of 4 Page 3physical training on college students’ swimming injury is discussed, and 
the commonly used FMS test is selected as the judgment index, and 
the three-point system is used for scoring. The higher the score is, the 
better the relevant movements are mastered and the smoother the 
movement process is; The lower the score is, the more unfamiliar and 
difficult it is in the whole exercise process.
It can be seen from Table 3 that after 12 weeks of experimental 
training, the FMS scores of the two groups of college students have 
improved to a certain extent, which indicates that the students are 
smoother in performing related actions and have higher scores, thus 
reducing the risk of sports injury during the exercise. Through the com -
parison between the two groups, it can be seen that the improvement 
range of the control group score is smaller than that of the experimental 
group, indicating that the traditional sports skill teaching can provide 
a certain impetus for the change of college students’ FMS test scores, 
thereby reducing the risk of sports injury, but its effect is not as good 
as the targeted physical training proposed in this paper. It can be seen 
from the overall scores of the two groups that although most of the 
experimental groups have reached more than two points after the ex -
periment, indicating that their scores are good, there are still some low 
scores. Therefore, in the process of sports teaching, PE teachers also need 
to strengthen the standardization and inspection of their movement 
skills to prevent sports injuries.
Improvement of college students’ swimming skills through 
physical training
In terms of the improvement of college students’ swimming skills, 
the slow swimming time and the scores of college students’ swimming 
skills were selected as the reference objects, as shown in Table 4.
It can be seen from Table 4 that through effective targeted physi -
cal training, the students in the experimental group have significantly 
improved their swimming speed and swimming score. Although the 
control group has also improved to some extent, the effect is not ob -
vious compared with the experimental group, which shows that the 
targeted physical training proposed in this paper can better improve 
the swimming skills of college students.DISCUSSION
Physical strength includes strength, endurance, speed, coordination 
and sensitivity. Moreover, physical training is the most important part of 
a complete training system. Generally speaking, physical training aims to 
improve sports performance and explore the upper limit of its potential. In 
the process of swimming, it is necessary to adjust its own motion state and 
posture in real time through the excellent strength attribute of the body. 
Due to the particularity of swimming events, the environmental resistance 
in water is far greater than that in air during sports. Therefore, the level 
of physical energy consumption of swimming events is also higher than 
that of some conventional sports events. In the existing physical training 
system, there are several links for targeted training. The first is core strength 
training. The body is in an unbalanced state during the movement in water. 
The balance of the whole body cannot be supported by the strength of 
the lower limbs as in the ground environment. Therefore, in the water, the 
power of the core muscle group in the waist and abdomen is extremely 
important. Secondly, lower limb strength training. In the process of swim -
ming, there are many technical movements in which the legs participate. 
Excellent leg strength helps college students have faster speed ability. Third, 
it is the role of upper limb strength. Through the project characteristics 
of swimming, you can intuitively feel the process of arm participation in 
sports. According to the technical needs, during the movement, you can 
control the movement state of the water by adjusting the amplitude and 
frequency of the stroke. Therefore, through upper limb strength training, 
we can effectively improve the ability to adjust the movement state. The 
fourth is the training of endurance attributes. Endurance is very impor -
tant in swimming physical training. Among them, exercise intensity and 
exercise often put forward higher requirements for endurance. In addition, 
the core content of swimming is also the endurance leading event. The -
refore, during training, improving muscle endurance and cardiovascular 
endurance is an effective way to improve project performance. Flexibility 
training cannot be ignored in the project. Having good flexibility means 
that joints and muscles can easily meet sports requirements. The physical 
health of college students is very important. Through a scientific training 
system, the physical quality of college students can be effectively improved.

Swimming can not only improve the physical quality of students, but 
also enable students to have more self-protection ability in the face of 
emergencies. Therefore, many colleges and universities have joined the 
swimming course. Strengthening the swimming ability of nonprofessio -
nal college students is also the focus of many PE teachers. The research 
results of this paper show that selecting targeted sports training can better improve the students’ swimming speed and make their movements more 
standard, which can not only give full play to the effect of swimming to 
strengthen the body, but also increase the quality level of college students, 
thus promoting the all-round development of college students.
