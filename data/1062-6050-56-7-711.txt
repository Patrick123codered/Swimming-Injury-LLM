Context: The number of women’s swimming and diving
teams sponsored by the National Collegiate Athletic Association
has increased over the last 5 years.
Background: Routine examinations of women’s swimming
and diving injuries are important for identifying emerging
temporal patterns.
Methods: Exposure and injury data collected in the National
Collegiate Athletic Association Injury Surveillance Program
during the 2014–2015 through 2018–2019 athletic seasons
were analyzed. Injury counts, rates, and proportions were usedto describe injury characteristics, and injury rate ratios wereused to examine differences in injury rates.
Results: The overall injury rate was 1.78 per 1000 athlete-
exposures in swimmers and 2.49 per 1000 AEs in divers.Shoulder (33.0%) injuries accounted for the largest proportion of
all swimming injuries; most injuries were classified as overuse(51.3%). Head or face (29.4%) and trunk (20.2%) injuries
accounted for the largest proportions of all diving injuries.
Summary: Findings indicated that shoulder and trunk
injuries, as well as injuries resulting from overuse mechanisms,
warrant further attention in swimming. Given the low in the
National Collegiate Athletic Association Injury Surveillance
Program observed across the study period, the need for greaterparticipation in sports injury surveillance is also apparent.

Swimming and diving are among the most well-
known summer Olympic sports.1In the United
States, both swimming and diving are popular from
the youth to National Collegiate Athletic Association
(NCAA) level. In recent years, the number of participating
athletes and NCAA-sponsored teams have steadily in-creased, with nearly 13 000 women’s swimming and diving
athletes competing in 2018–2019.
2It is reasonable to
suggest that this increasing participation has implicationswith regard to not only the competitive nature of the sport
but also injury risk, given the larger pool of athletes at risk
of injury. Despite these implications, few researchers havedescribed the epidemiology of injuries in this population.Such reports can facilitate appraisal of the overall health of
NCAA women’s swimming and diving athletes, highlightspeciﬁc areas for attention, and help to inform targeted
interventions aimed at injury prevention.
The NCAA initiated an injury surveillance system to
monitor injuries within collegiate athletics in 1982, whichin its current form is known as the NCAA Injury
Surveillance Program (ISP).
3,4The NCAA ISP has
collected data on women’s swimming and diving since2006-2007, and the most recent study using these data(captured during 2009-2010 through 2013-2014) identiﬁedthe overall injury rate in women’s swimming and diving asapproximately 2 injuries per 1000 athlete-exposures (AEs).
5
It has also been noted that injury rates were higher in divingthan in swimming (2.49 per 1000 AEs versus 1.63 per 1000AEs, respectively).
5Furthermore, it has been reported that
most injuries among NCAA women’s swimmers occur tothe shoulder, whereas injuries among divers occur mostcommonly to the trunk.
5In addition, it has been previously
indicated that injuries among NCAA women’s swimmingAuthors Avinash Chandran and Sarah N. Morris have contributed
equally to manuscript preparation. The articles in this issue are

and diving are most often classiﬁed as overuse and/or non-
contact injuries.5
Frequent examination of injury incidence over time is
necessary to assess health and safety issues, and to allow
stakeholders to implement nuanced injury prevention
strategies. Given the time elapsed since the previousepidemiological investigation of this population, it is
important to examine recent patterns in injury incidence
among these athletes. As such, the purpose of this studywas to describe the epidemiology of sport-related injuriesamong women’s swimming and diving student-athletes in a
sample of NCAA teams during the 2014–2015 through
2018–2019 academic years.
METHODS
Study Data
Women’s swimming and diving exposure and injury data
collected in the NCAA ISP during the 2014–2015 through
2018–2019 athletic seasons were analyzed in this study.The ISP has been reviewed and approved as an exempt
study by the NCAA Research Review Board. The methods
of the surveillance program are described in detail in aseparate manuscript within this special issue.
6Brieﬂy,
athletic trainers (ATs) at participating institutions contrib-
uted exposure and injury data by using their clinical
electronic medical record systems. A reportable injury wasone that occurred due to participation in an organized
intercollegiate practice or competition and required medical
attention by a team AT or physician, regardless of time loss(TL). Scheduled team practices and competitions were
considered reportable exposures for this analysis. Data from
8 (2% of membership with sponsored programs) partici-pating programs in 2014–2015, 7 (1% of membership withsponsored programs) in 2015–2016, 10 (2% of membership
with sponsored programs) in 2016–2017, 15 (3% of
membership with sponsored programs) in 2017–2018, and36 (6% of membership with sponsored programs) in 2018–
2019 qualiﬁed for inclusion in analyses. Qualiﬁcation
criteria are detailed further in the aforementioned methodsmanuscript.

Classifying Injuries and AEs by Swimming Versus
Diving
Injured athletes were identiﬁed as either swimmers or
divers when injury records were submitted by the AT. Forinjury records with an unknown athlete type, the injured
athlete was assumed to be a swimmer if the corresponding
activity at the time of injury was reported as backstroke,breaststroke, butterﬂy, freestyle, or medley; and the athlete
was assumed a diver if the corresponding activity was
reported as 1.0-m board, 1.0-m platform, 3.0-m board, 3.0-m platform, 5.0-m platform, 7.5-m platform, or 10.0-m
platform. Records for which athlete type was not
identiﬁable (either by AT report or activity, as notedabove) were not retained in the analysis (n ¼10). Combined
AEs were collected for swimming and diving teams in the
NCAA ISP. Previous researchers in this population
determined that, on average, 87% of athletes on swimmingand diving team rosters are swimmers, whereas 13% are
divers.
5Injury rates were calculated using the appropriate
distribution of AEs for each athlete type.Statistical Analysis
Injury counts and rates per 1000 AEs for each athlete
type (swimmers or divers) were examined by event type(practice or competition) and TL (TL or non-TL [NTL]).An AE was deﬁned as 1 athlete participating in 1 exposureevent. Weighted and unweighted rates were estimated;however, results were presented in terms of unweightedrates (unless otherwise speciﬁed) due to low frequencies ofinjury observations across levels of certain explanatoryvariables. Temporal trends in injury rates (pooled forpractices and competitions) across the study period weredescribed using rate proﬁle plots stratiﬁed by athlete type.Injury counts and proportions were examined by body partinjured, mechanism of injury, injury diagnosis, and activityat the time of injury. Respiratory infections (n ¼41) were
not included in analyses due to reporting inconsistenciesacross the study period. Injury rate ratios (IRRs) were usedto examine differential injury rates across event types. IRRswith associated 95% conﬁdence intervals (CIs) excluding1.00 were considered statistically signiﬁcant. All analyses
were conducted using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute).
RESULTS
A total of 630 women’s swimming and diving injuries
(swimmers: 521; divers: 109) from 336851 AEs (swim-mers: 293060; divers: 43,791) were reported to the NCAAISP during the 2014–2015 through 2018–2019 athleticseasons (rate: swimmers ¼1.78 per 1000 AEs; divers ¼2.49
per 1000 AEs). This equated to a national estimate of23 281 injuries overall (swimmers: 19 734; divers: 3548;Table 1). Practice and competition injury rates did notsigniﬁcantly differ in both swimming and diving. Injuryrates in women’s swimming remained relatively stablebetween 2014–2015 and 2015–2016, then increasedthrough 2017–2018 before decreasing in the ﬁnal year ofthe study (Figure). Injury rates in women’s divingdecreased notably between 2014–2015 and 2015–2016,and then steadily increased through 2017–2018 beforedecreasing in the ﬁnal year of the study (Figure). Similarly,by inspecting injury incidence in diving, we found that theinjury rate decreased notably between 2014–2015 and2015–2016 and then steadily increased through 2017–2018before decreasing in the ﬁnal year of the study (Figure).
Time Loss
Original sentence: In both women’s swimming and
diving, NTL injuries represented a larger proportion ofreported injuries than TL injuries (swimmers: NTL- 49.9%;TL- 28.6%; missing- 21.5%; divers: NTL- 45.0%; TL-40.4%; missing- 14.7%). TL injuries accounted for agreater proportion of reported competition (43.1%) injuriesthan practice (27.0%) injuries in women’s swimming.Conversely, TL injuries accounted for a greater proportionof reported practice (41.0%) injuries than competition(33.3%) injuries in women’s diving.
Injury Characteristics
Injuries to the shoulder (33.0%) and trunk (15.6%)
accounted for the largest proportions of all injuries reportedin women’s swimming during the study period (Table 2).Most swimming injuries were attributed to overuse (51.3%)
712 Volume 56 /C15Number 7 /C15July 2021
and noncontact (18.0%) mechanisms. Overuse injuries
accounted for a larger proportion of practice-related(52.6%) than competition-related (39.2%) women’s swim-ming injuries. Noncontact injuries accounted for compara-ble proportions of practice- and competition-related injuries(Table 2). Most women’s swimming injuries reportedduring 2014–2015 through 2018–2019 were categorized asinﬂammatory conditions (23.8%) and strains (12.9%). Themost commonly reported speciﬁc injury diagnoses duringthe study period were shoulder impingement (8.6%; rate ¼
1.54 per 10 000 AEs), biceps tendonitis (shoulder) (7.9%;
rate¼1.40 per 10 000 AEs), and rotator cuff tendonitis
(5.4%; rate ¼0.96 per 10 000 AEs).
Injuries to the head or face (29.4%) and trunk (20.2%)
accounted for the largest proportions of all women’s divinginjuries reported during the study period (Table 3). Injurieswere most commonly attributed to surface contact (31.2%)and overuse (23.9%) mechanisms. Women’s diving injuriesreported during the study period were distributed across
several diagnostic classiﬁcations (Table 3). Concussionsaccounted for 13.8% of all reported injuries in diving,
although this result should be interpreted with caution giventhe low number of diving injuries reported across the studyperiod.
Injuries by Swimming- and Diving-Specific Activities
Most women’s swimming injuries from 2014–2015
through 2018–2019 occurred during freestyle stroke(47.2%) and conditioning (14.4%; Table 4). Freestylestroke in particular accounted for 60.9% of all reportedshoulder injuries and 44.4% of all trunk injuries inswimming. Most women’s diving injuries during the studyperiod occurred in unspeciﬁed diving activities (30.3%) and3.0-m board (24.8%).
SUMMARY
We aimed to describe the epidemiology of NCAA
women’s swimming- and diving-related injuries reportedto the NCAA ISP during the 2014–2015 through 2018–2019 academic years. Injury rates in women’s swimmingremained relatively low during 2014–2015 to 2015–2016,as compared with the latter years of the study period. Theoverall women’s swimming injury rate observed in thepresent study was consistent with previous ﬁndings in thispopulation.
5Furthermore, there were no differences
between practice- and competition-related injury rates inwomen’s swimming, a ﬁnding also consistent with previousreports.
5Although these ﬁndings appear to indicate stability
in injury incidence among NCAA women’s swimmingathletes across 2 time periods, it is necessary to note that inthe context of injury surveillance, these inferences aredrawn on the basis of relatively small numbers of injuryobservations. Furthermore, we only examined temporaltrends in overall injury incidence (and not by event type),which was also the case in previous reports. Given thatcompetition exposures account for a smaller proportion ofall reported exposures than practice exposures, it is perhapsunsurprising that few competition injuries were capturedduring the present study period.

observed competition injuries also precluded juxtapositions
of differential injury distributions between event types for
several explanatory variables of interest (eg, comparisonsof injury distributions by activity across event types). Assuch, future researchers may not only examine temporal
patterns in injury incidence with more granularity (by event
type, for instance), but also target the distribution ofcompetition-related injuries for further attention. Such
examinations will not only help elucidate factors in the
sport that contributed to the burden of injury among NCAAwomen’s swimming athletes, but also highlight areas fordirecting injury prevention efforts in this population.
Nearly one-half of all reported injuries in women’s
swimming were NTL injuries. Notably, the prevalence ofTL injuries was higher among reported competition injuries
than practice injuries. Furthermore, more than 60% of
competition injuries were attributed to noncontact andoveruse mechanisms. Although the low number of
competition injuries reported across the study period
restrict the inferential capacity of these injury distributions
(ie, the extent to which these ﬁndings represent truedistributions), it is important to consider that overuse and
noncontact injuries also accounted for a large proportion
(~70%) of all reported practice injuries. Together, with
these ﬁndings, we indicate the need to further examine the
complex injury etiology associated with muscular andconnective tissue breakdown during high-intensity repeti-
tive movements inherent to swimming,
7which occur
similarly during practice and competition events and maynot be attributed to a discrete point in time. It is reasonable
to suggest that injury prevention efforts in women’s
swimming may target commonly injured body parts, such
as the shoulder and trunk, for further attention and targeted
care in protecting against chronic workloads that mayTable 2. Distribution of Swimmer Injuries by Body Part, Mechanism, and Injury Diagnosis; Stratified by Event Typea

contribute to overuse injuries.8,9Future researchers may
also aim to better understand the etiology of workload
accumulation in women’s swimming athletes that may be
unspeciﬁc to a particular event type and rather inherent tothe sport. The physiologic strain on the shoulder during all
swimming motions requires muscular endurance, excellent
technique, and a large range of motion.
10,11This may be
particularly salient with regard to injuries attributed to the
freestyle stroke, which was most prevalently associatedwith reported injuries in the present study, and also
accounted for large proportions of shoulder and trunk
injuries. With that said, the observed prevalence of injuries
attributed to freestyle stroke may be unsurprising given the
frequent use of the freestyle stroke among practices andcompetitions.
12The freestyle stroke consists of a complex
series of muscle activation with antagonistic activity in the
biceps and triceps brachii to maintain joint stability during
the early pull-through phase, the pectoralis major and
latissimus dorsi during the underwater phase, and therotator cuff throughout the stroke.13,14The trunk also serves
an integral role as a stable base that allows for a transfer of
force from the core to the extremities.15–17A breakdown in
this force transfer has been previously shown to predispose
overhead athletes to shoulder injury.18Such ﬁndings
suggesting a related injury risk in these body parts in other
overhead-concentrated sports indicate that this kinetic link
warrants further attention in women’s swimming athletes.
The overall women’s diving injury rate in the present
study was comparable to that in previous reports in this
population.5Due to the limitations in stratifying diving
injuries by explanatory variables of interest, it is difﬁcult tocontextualize these ﬁndings for the reasons described in
subsequent sections. Most women’s diving injuries oc-
curred to the head/face and trunk. Coupled with the
observed prevalence of knee and shoulder injuries, these
ﬁndings are arguably consistent with expectations given thenature of the sport. For instance, head/face injuries were
most often attributed to surface contact mechanismsTable 3. Distribution of Diver Injuries by Body Part, Mechanism, and Injury Diagnosis; Stratified by Event Typea

(particularly with water) in the present study; this result is
unsurprising given that diving athletes often break the
surface tension of water at high velocities.19,20Furthermore,
the biomechanical nuances of diving align with the
prevalence of trunk, shoulder, and knee injuries observed
in the present study. The sequence of diving begins with‘‘take-off ’’from a stable (or unstable) surface in the form of
a handstand or jump that requires considerable neuromus-
cular control of the lower extremity and trunk, followed by
ﬂight and entry, for which athletes perform complex
maneuvers that demand precise proprioception.
21The entry
has been measured at 7.58 m/s on average in the 1.0-m
(springboard) dive and 9.54 m/s on average in the 3.0-m(springboard) dive into the water, which may particularly
affect the hand or wrist, arm or elbow, shoulder, trunk, and
head or face.
20–22Each phase of a dive predisposes the
athlete to various risks of injury across the kinetic chain
that may be accumulated over a series of dives that may
vary in difﬁculty as athletes work to develop new skills.
With the ﬁndings of the present study (in particular, the
observed prevalence of shoulder, trunk, and knee injuries),
we indicate that injuries in women’s diving are distributedacross the kinetic chain
23and suggest that future research-
ers may leverage this rationale in directing research efforts.
However, given the low number of diving injuries observed
in this study, it is important not only to exercise caution in
drawing inferences from the observed results but also to
acknowledge that future studies regarding the etiology of
injuries across the kinetic chain in this population are
needed to inform injury prevention efforts.
Although the results of the present study extend the
existing literature surrounding injury incidence in NCAA
women’s swimming and diving, it is important to consider
the limitations that warrant further attention in examiningthese results. To begin with, participation in the NCAA ISP
among women’s swimming and diving programs was low
across the study period, which limited the analytical scope
of the present study, as well as the overall external validityof ﬁndings. More speciﬁcally, and as alluded to above, low
participation precluded several cross-tabulations in this
particular analysis. As a corollary to this point, sports injury
surveillance is often leveraged to closely monitor temporal
patterns in injury incidence; however, robust participation
in surveillance is also critical for securing the requisite
volume of data to support such investigations. Therefore, as
future researchers consider studying this population, it is
concurrently important to emphasize the continued surveil-lance and strong participation in surveillance programs.
Furthermore, while considering the estimates of injury
incidence presented here, it is important to acknowledge
that there exist 2 fundamental compromises involved in
their estimation. First, the representation of at-risk exposure
time by using AEs may be particularly imprecise for
swimming and diving. Given the individualized nature ofswimming and diving activities, at-risk exposure time
captured as AEs may not appropriately represent true
differences in exposure time between athletes irrespective
of their position or event (swimming or diving). Second,
although swimming and diving are typically uniﬁed as a
single sport within member institutions, swimming and
diving exposures, including the likelihood and nature of
contact, are inherently different due to the differences in
activities and training routines between swimming anddiving athletes.
24Swimmers typically repeat comparable
movements at high volumes, whereas divers perform highly
technical maneuvers at comparatively lower volumes. The
consolidation of swimming and diving as a single sport,
coupled with the current structure of the NCAA ISP,Table 4. Distribution of Injuries by Injury Activity; Stratified by Athlete Type and Event Typea

precludes precise estimations of position-speciﬁc at-risk
exposure time. Although separating exposure time on the
basis of roster size (as seen here) is a practical solution, thisstrategy is understandably not ideal. As such, it is criticalthat future researchers studying this population not only
consider methods for more precisely capturing at-risk
exposure time in swimming and diving athletes but alsomeasure exposure time for swimming and diving separate-
ly. Athlete-level measurements using dedicated data
recorders or wearable technology may be effectivealternative strategies for exposure time ascertainment inthis population.
19,25,26Such strategies may also allow
researchers to capture more detailed exposure data, such
as swim distance, type and number of dives, and exertionalmetrics, in this group. Although the NCAA ISP is unable toaccommodate all of these measurement advancements in its
current form, researchers may conduct targeted studies to
pilot their feasibility and ultimately reﬁne them for large-scale implementation.
Injury surveillance in NCAA women’s swimming and
diving facilitates the identiﬁcation of emerging injury-
related patterns in this population, and healthy participationin surveillance programs is critical to support meaningfulinferences. With the ﬁndings of the present study, we direct
attention toward potential areas for further monitoring in
this athlete population, such as the incidence of shoulderand trunk injuries, as well as overuse injuries. We alsohighlight meaningful differences in injury incidence
between swimming and diving athletes. In addition, in the
discussions above, we offer important study designconsiderations for future research in this population.Together, the ﬁndings and discussions presented here will
be critical for informing future work that will profoundly
affect injury prevention in this population.
