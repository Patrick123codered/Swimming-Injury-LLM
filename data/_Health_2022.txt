 Synopsis  
Title: Health status of South African masters swimmers, their medication use and 
attitudes towards doping  
Candidate : Annemarie Henriette Dressler  
Supervisor : Dr K Nolte  
Co-supervisor : Prof BJM Steyn  
Degree : MSc Sports Science (Biokinetics)  
Key words: athletes, c hronic disease, injury, Performance -Enhancing Substances, 
PEAS , medication use, quantitative, cross -sectional design.   
Physical inactivity is recognised as one of the main causes of the onset of chronic 
diseases such as diabetes  (DM) , coronary artery dise ase ( CAD ) and cancer.1 In 
recognition of this the South African government has started programs like the Let’s 
Play physical education challenge to motivate children to exercise and the Long -term 
Participant Development Program (LTPD) to motivate athletes  to transition from 
competitive participation  to staying active for life.2 Due to the increased importance 
attached to exercise and a healthy lifestyle, older adults explore  and engage in 
recreational pursuits to once again compete as athletes in sports that they previously 
partook in.3 This has led to increased participation in recreational and competitive 
sporting events  world -wide.4 This is also evident in South Afri ca where participation in 
swimming events has increased in popularity. Open water swims such as the aQuellé 
Midmar Mile attract large entry numbers. In 2019 , the aQuellé Midmar Mile drew over 
12 000 swimmers, many of them adult swimmers, making it the larg est open water 
event in the world.5   
As age increases, adults experience a higher prevalence of chronic diseases .6-8 
Masters athletes with diagnosed chronic disease and injuries train for and take part in 
swimming events. They use prescribed or  over the counter (OTC) medication to treat

 their disease and/or injuries and to alleviate pain.9, 10 Some of the medication used by 
masters swimmers may carry health risks in training and competition contexts and 
may also be prohibited before and during competitions.11, 12 The main aim of this study 
was to investigate the health status and associated medic ation  use of South African 
masters swimmers. Quantifying possible unintentional doping infringements through 
the use of medication and intentional doping with the sole purpose to enhance 
performance will provide insight into doping complexities faced by masters  swimmers . 
This study also analysed the  doping attitudes and doping knowledge of South African 
masters swimmers . 
The study used a cross -sectional design. A web -based, online survey was used to 
collect quantitative data based on the aims and objectives of t he study. Initial 
purposive sampling of the swimmers in the South African Masters Swimming ( SAMS ) 
database w as broadened to snowball sampling to target a sample of both competitive 
and recreational master s swimmers. Participation in the survey was anonymou s and 
voluntary.  To test the self -constructed questionnaires’ validity and consistency and to 
limit survey bias, a pilot study was conducted on 10 randomly selected masters 
swimmers  representative of the population . Their feedback on the survey process, 
length and question structure was used to improve the online survey structure and 
questions.  
Data curing and analysis of the data w as done independently by a statistician using 
Microsoft Excel and SPSS data analysis software version 28.1. Grouping of 
medicat ions was done by a registered pharmacist using the EMGuidance  application.  
The survey resulted in 359 responses with 48.7%  male swimmers and 50.7%  female 
swimmers . Results show  swimmers taking part in a variety of events namely triathlon  
and Ironman, pool and open water events. Two participants did not disclose their 
gender.   
The mean age of the participants was 51.3 with a standard deviation of 1.5 years. 
Given the option of sel ecting three motivation s why they train and compete in 
swimming the dominant motivation of the swimmers to was to improve health and 
fitness (85%), followed by the motivations to relieve stress (47.4%) and for enjoy ment

 and fun (45. 5%). The prevalence of c hronic disease in the master s swimmers was 
39.1% . The results showed that 22.4% of participants  had only one chronic disease 
and 16.5% reported multi -morbidity. There was a significant (p<0.001) weak positive 
relationship  between chronic disease and age showing a  Pearson correlation  
coefficient of r=0.24. There was also a significant (p<0.001), weak positive relationship 
(r=0.26) between number of chronic diseases  and age.  
The populati on percentage  for chronic medication use was 33.7%  and 11. 4% of the 
participants used medication that is on the World Anti -doping Agency (WADA) 
prohibited  list.  
Participants  reported  an injury prevalence of  26.1% in the five years preceding the 
survey with injuries in  the shoulder region most frequently reported (18.1%) and 
tendinitis (9.7%) being the most prevalent reported shoulder injury. There was a 
significant (p<0.005) but weak negative correlation ( r=-0.15) between age and injury 
prevalence.  
Analysis of the pres cribed and OTC  medication showed that 16.4% of the study 
participants took medication to treat injury or illness shortly before or during 
competitions. The most used  medication was Nonsteroidal Anti -inflammatory Drugs  
(NSAIDs ) (15%) , analgesics (4.5%) and cortisone (2.5%).  
In response to the direct life -long and current doping questions o nly one male swimmer 
indicated t hat he had  used a banned substance. No participants  indicated that they 
are currently using Prohibited Performance -enhancing Drugs  (PEDs ). The expressed 
attitude of the participants  on the  Performance Enhancement Attitude Scale  (PEAS ) 
8-item instrument  showed that masters swimmers do not have a positive or lenient 
attitude toward s doping. Specific questions set to test the swimmers ’ attitude towards 
chronic medication use , indicated that they believed that chronic medication helped 
masters swimmers to p erform as healthy individuals and that this medication use 
should not be construed as doping.  Swimmers showed limited knowledge of doping 
and Therapeutic Use Exemption ( TUE) application. This study may assist in steering 
doping education in the right direc tion.

 To the researcher ’s knowledge, no studies have been conducted on master s 
swimmers in South Africa relating to health status and doping. This study will add to 
the limited research that has been done on this study population.  To make training 
and com petitions safer  for masters swimmers , future research could  focus on pre -
screening to determine the risk factors that may contribute to cardiovascular events 
and injury .

 Chapter 1: Introduction  
Background  
Physical inactivity is recognised by the World Health Organization (WHO) as one of 
the main causes of chronic diseases such as DM, Cardiovascular Disease ( CVD ) and 
cancer.1 In recognition of this , the South African government has started programs like 
the Let’s Play physical education challenge  to motivate children to exercise and the 
Long-term Participant Development Program to motivate athletes  to transition from 
competitive participation  to staying active for life.2 Due to the increased importance 
attached to exercise and a healthy lifestyle , older adults are looking to return to ne w 
and former recreational and competitive  sports.3 This has led to increased participation 
in recreational and co mpetitive sporting events.4 This is also evident in South Africa 
where participation in swimming events has increased in popularity.5  
For the purposes of this study ma sters athletes are defined as “Individuals who 
systematically train for  and compete in, organi sed forms of competitive sport 
specifically designed for older adults. ”13 In the South African context masters 
swimmers  are classed as  swimmers 18 years and older and constitutes a sub -set of 
masters athletes as defined above.14 
As age increase s, adults experience a higher prevalence of chronic diseases .6-8 
Masters athletes  with diagnosed chronic  disease and injuries train for and take part in 
swimming events  such as the World Masters Games (WMG) . They use prescribed or  
OTC  medication to treat their disease  and/or injuries  and to alleviate pain .9, 10 Some 
of the medication used by masters swimmers may carry health risks in training and 
competition  contexts  and may also be prohibited before and during competitions .11, 12 
To this end a n exploration of the concept of doping , doping control  and the use of 
prohibited substances is necessary  in the South African masters swimmer s context .   
Doping can be defined as the collective term used to describe the use of prohibited 
substances or methods to enhance performance.15 The use of PEDs before and during 
sporting competition s is prohibited for all athletes  including swimmers . The World Anti -
Doping Agenc y (WADA) implemented policies on anti -doping to make sporting

 competitions fair and equal and to protect the health of athletes.16 Masters swimmers 
in South Africa are also subjected to the WADA criteria when they partake in events.17, 
18 
Masters swimmers might commit infringements in a variety of ways. Research shows 
that masters athletes competing in the various  sporting codes  at the WMG commit 
doping offences through the use of prescribed medicine to treat chronic disease.10 
Studies also showed that masters athletes  get injured in their preparation for or during 
competition s and that they take OTC drugs such as pain killers and NSAIDs to treat 
these injuries.19, 20 Although NSAIDs are not on the WADA prohibited list, their 
potential heal th risk s for athletes ha s been well documented.21, 22 Purposive doping 
with the sole motivation to increase performance  has been reported mostly in studies 
on elite athletes.23-25 A recent study on ultra -marathon runners demonstrated that 
competitive masters  athletes may elect to use PEDs . The same study showed that 
competitiveness and a positive attitude towards doping was  positively correlated to 
doping behaviour .26  
Adults enter swimming events for a variety of reasons including increased health and 
fitness, to delay old age, to social ise and to be  competitive and to win.27-30 In order to 
understand why  masters swimmers would use PEDs the motivation  and attitude of 
masters swimmers towards intentional and unintentional doping w as measured . 
Necessity and value of the study  
The results of this study provide d insight into the health status and medication use of 
masters swimmers. Comparison of the medication used by the swimmers with the 
WADA prohibited list show ed the prevalence  of doping infringements. T esting t he 
attitudes of the swimmers towards doping shed  light on the intentional and 
unintentional doping complexities faced by masters athletes. To  the researcher ’s

 Chapter 2: Literature review  
Introduction  
A short overview of the most recent and relevant literature on the research topic is 
included  below . Sources include the internet, books, research -based  articles in peer -
reviewed journals, conference presented papers , dissertations and theses that 
contained the key words s wimming, masters swimmers, older adults combined with 
health status, doping  and doping  attitudes . 
These  sources were selected to  develop  an overall understanding of who masters 
swimmers are, why masters swimmers compete, their health status , their medication 
use, doping  implications , doping control in their environment and their attitudes 
towards doping. Th e aim of the literature study is to provide a framework for the 
presentation  and discuss ion of the results  and conclusions  of this study.  
Defining a masters athlete and the context in which they compete  
The global  body that controls all aquatic sport, FINA governs seven aquatic disciplines 
namely swimming, open water swimming, diving, high diving, water polo, artistic 
swimming  and the masters programme.31 FINA regulates  recreational and co mpetitive 
masters swimm ing events for masters swimmers world -wide.32  
In South Africa, Swimming South Africa ( SSA) is the national body that regulates 
swimming. SSA acknowledges masters swimming in their constitution and all rules 
that apply to younger swimmers also appl y to masters swimmers.18 Masters pool 
swimmers competing in the South African masters championship must be registered 
with SAMS and SSA.14 Open water recreational and competit ive swimmers do not 
have to be registered with SAMS or SSA and can enter any open water event in South 
Africa on an individual basis.   
The following definition of a masters athlete was used for this study:  “Masters athletes 
are individuals who systematical ly train for  and compete in, organi sed forms of 
competitive sport specifically designed for older adults. ”13 The definition allows for a 
range of recreational athletes competing for health, fitness and social motivations as

27 
 well as athletes who take part due to competitive motivations.29 Masters swimmers 
comprise a sub -set of masters athletes, 18 years and older that compete in organised 
sporting e vents such as open water swims, WMG, triathlon , pentathlon  and pool 
events.  
FINA group pool and open water masters swimmers in to five-year age categories 
starting from 25 years and upwards.33 Following the SAMS age categories  pre-
masters aged 18  - 24 w ere also included in this study.14 Age groups for triathlon  are 
also divided into five -year age groups  starting from 15 years  and upwards .  
Why do masters swimmers train and take part in sporting events?  
To establish the relationships between motivation, chronic disease, injury and doping 
in South African masters swimmers it was necessary to first explore why masters 
swimmers compete.  
Recent years have shown an increased participation in sporting events organi sed 
specifically for older athletes. Internationally , WMG participation has increased from   
8 305 athletes participating in the first 1985 Toronto (Canada) Games  to 28 571  
athletes participating in the 2017  Auckland (New Zealand) Games.4  
Open water swims in South Africa such as the aQuellé Midmar Mile attract large entry 
numbers. In 2019 , the aQuellé Midmar Mile drew over 12  000 swimmers, many of 
them adult swimmers, making it the largest open water event in the world.5 In 2019,  1 
699 amateur triathletes entere d to compete in the Ironman South Africa competition.34 
The 36th South African Masters Long Course Swimming Championships held in March 
2020 saw 370 masters swimmers compete over five days. In this event in 2020, the 
youngest swimmer was 19 -years old  and the oldest swimmer was an 88 -year-old 
male. The South African Masters Open Water Championships during the same week 
had 101 swimmers competing for the titles.35  
In the FINA constitution  masters programmes are designed with the motto to promote 
fitness, friendship, understanding and competi tion.32 The motivation s for masters 
swimmers to train and take part in events range from the creation of opportunities to

28 
 travel, to compete and win, to improve health and fitness, skills development  and 
companionship.36 
Previous studies  by Adams et al.27 and Walsh et al.29 on WMG participants found that  
the most important motivations for competing was to sociali se with other participants , 
followed by the health considerations to become more physically fit and to improve 
health. The competing to win motivation was less important to the se athletes .  
In the South African context, t he motivation of open water swimmers seem s to align 
with th e above -mentioned  findings. It w as identified in a survey on 461 swimmers at 
the 2010 Midmar mile that socialisation and escape, fun and entertainment and 
intrinsic achievement  was seen as motivators to participate in event s.37 
Health status of masters swimmers  
The relevant literature on the health status  of masters athletes , specifically pertaining 
to the prevale nce of chronic disease and injury , are considered below.  
Defining  chronic disease  
For the purpose of this study c hronic disease is defined as a disease that progresses 
slowly over time and that persists over a long period.38 An analysis of South African 
medical scheme beneficiary data by Cairncross et al. for 3 924  901 patients  between 
2011 and 2016 showed the top nine chronic diseases to be Hypertension (HTN), 
Hyperlipidaemia (HLD), DM, Asthma  (AST) , Hypothyroidism, CAD , Cardiomyopathy  
(CMY) , Epilepsy and Bipolar Mood Disorder  (BMD) .39 
Although the medical aid Chronic Disease List ( CDL) specifies CAD as one of the top 
nine chronic heart diseases , most research use the broader umbrella term of CVD . 
CVD  includes CAD and all diseases typically involving in narrow ing or obstruct ing 
blood vessels. The CDL specifies CVD to include CMY, ischaemic heart disease, 
dysrhythmias and HTN. For the purposes of comparison with other literature the above 
definition of CVD including CAD is used , unless HTN is specifically excluded as a 
separate disease.  The term heart disease was used in the questionnaire to make it 
more easily understandable for the participants.

29 
  
Hypothyroidism in the CDL was also broadened to thyroid  disease in the questionnaire 
and include s all diseases of the thyroid.  
For the purposes of this study multi -morbidity is  defined as the simultaneous presence 
of two or more chronic diseases in one participant.  
General p opulation prevalence of chronic dis eases  
The general population for the purposes of this study is defined as all individuals (not 
only athletes) that have been included in a sample with selection criteria similar to 
those used in this study i.e . chronic disease status. This can include coun try-wide 
health surveys or medical aid statistics . As concluded by Banerjee et al. inferences 
between the study population of South African masters swimmers, masters athletes 
and the general population should be made with caution.40 
Studies have concluded that participation in physical activity and sport reduces the 
risk factors that lead to disease development and as such lowers the prevalence of 
chronic disease.6, 9, 41 This could be why  masters athletes display a lower prevalence 
of chronic disease when compared to general population statistics .42, 43 
Internationally, s urveys at the WMG in 2008, 2017 and 2018, used an age comparison 
to compare  the prevalence of chronic disease in masters athletes to the Australian 
Health Survey data. They found that mas ters athletes have a lower prevalence of  
health related indices that might lead to chronic disease  when compared to that of the 
general population.9, 44  
In the 2010  United States of America (USA) National Health Interview Survey , 24.8% 
of adults 18 years and older had one chronic condition namely HT N, CVD , Stroke, 
DM, Cancer, Osteo - and Rheumatoid Arthritis (OA/RA ), Hepatitis, Kidney  disease 
(KD), Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease , or AST and 26% of the participants  
had multi -morbidity .45 The Australian National Health Survey conducted on adults 18 
and older in 2017  - 2018, showed that 47% of Australians had one or more chronic 
conditions. Breaking down the prevalence per condition in this survey showed HT N

 (22.8%), Mental and Behavioural Diseases  (MBD) (20.1%), back problems (16.4%), 
OA/RA  (15.0%), AST (11.2%), Diabetes mellites I ( DM1 ) (0.6%), DM2 (4.1%) , CVD 
and stroke (4.8%) , osteoporosis  (OP)  (3.8%) , COPD (2.5%) , cancer (1.8%)  and KD 
(1.0%) .46  
The South African National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey  (SANHANES -1) 
in 2016 conducted on adults 15 years and older showed the self -reported chronic 
disease prevalence was HTN (22.9), CVD (3.8%), cancer (1.2%), stroke (1.7%), HLD 
(4.1%), DM (5.1%), AST (4.1%), COPD (1.7%). More than  one condition was reported 
by 11.9% of the participants.47 
In another South African study on 710 adults aged 50 years and older , 73% of the 
participants  report ed one or more chronic disease. P revalence was shown as  HTN 
alone (25%), HT N and D M (8%), HT N and arthritis  (8%), arthritis  alone (8%) and D M 
alone (5%).48  
Prevalence of chronic disease in masters athletes  
An on -line survey of 7  210 participants in the WMG in Sydney in 20 09, found the 
prevalence of chronic diseases as HTN (9.5%), RA/OA (8.9%), AST (8.7%), HLD 
(6.4%) and depression (6.3%).49  
In South Africa, 15 778 runners competing in the Two Oceans Marathon completed a 
pre-screening health survey showing prevalence of chronic disease as CVD (2.3%), 
HTN (4.4%), HLD (6.2%), AST (5.9%)  and DM (1.0%).20 
Patelia  et al. found that 108 masters athletes  aged 50 or above had a lower prevalence  
of chronic disease (10.2%) when compared to chess -players and inactive or 
moderate ly active adults .43 A similar finding  by Bat ista et al ., showed that elite athletes 
had decreased risk factors for major chronic diseases when compared  to that of 
recreational  and non -athletes.41

31 
 Relationship between frequency of training and prevalence of chronic 
disease  
A study by McPhillips et al . found that 1  140 older adults between the ages of 50 and 
93 did more light exercise and less moderate to heavy exercise as they aged. Sixty 
percent (60%) of the participants  in the study exercised three times per week for a 
minimum of 20 minutes at a time. Those with a history of chronic disease exercised 
less frequently than their healthy counterparts.50  
Relationship between age and prevalence of chronic disease  
The statistics of the WHO and South African demographic and health survey in 2016 
both show that the prevalence of  chronic diseases increase d with age .6-8 A study by 
Steffler et al . on the general population in Ontario, Canada showed the prevalence of 
chronic disease and multi -morbidity  to increase in five -year age -groups until the age 
of 89. Thereafter the prevalence decreased slightly.8 
Prevalence of injuries  in masters athletes  
As highlighted by Walsh et al . the concern that older athletes might be more prone to 
injury due to the physiological aging process do es exist.9 Due to the repetitive nature 
of swimming, shoulder injuries are frequently reported in swimmers.51-53 
Pain is a good indicator of underlying injuries. Injuries and pain occurrence are often 
grouped by body region or specific joint. Atilla et al reported the one year prevalence 
of injured regions in 88  Turkish male masters swimmers as shoulder pain (42.0%), 
lower back (27.3%), neck (21.6%), back (13.6%), and knee (10.2%).54 
The following studies concluded that i njury in athletes may be  sport specific.  Climstein 
et al. investigated 1 418 Australian masters athletes and found no significant difference 
in injury type between swimming, rowing  and soccer. They did find significant 
difference s in injury location between the sports.55 Ristolainen et al . also found in a 
retrospective 12 -month study on swimmers, cross country skiers, long -distance 
runners and soccer players that type of sport is related to injury location.56

32 
 Relationship between age and prevalence of injury  
Research shows ambiguous  findings between aging and the prevalence of injury. 
Opar et al . found in a three -year follow up study that masters track and field athletes 
have a significantly greater risk of injuries when compared to their younger 
counterparts.57 A literature review  by Stathokostas  et al.  indicated that adults 65 years 
and older who participat ed in physical activity did not have an increased risk of injury.58 
Masters athletes competing in athletics and football competitions were shown to have 
a lower risk of injury before and during competition compared to younger elite athletes 
in the same sporting codes.59, 60 Ganze et al . studied the prevalence  and types of 
injuries during the 2012 European Veteran Athletics Championships in 3  154 athletes 
older than 35 years. They reported that injury prevalence  did not increase with age or 
performance.61 Stocker et al. compared younger collegiate and masters swimmers on 
shoulder pain lasting three weeks or more and found a pain prevalence  of 47 % and 
48% respectively.62  
Relationship between cross -training and prevalence of injury  
A study by Baker et al. conducted on masters swimmers (55  ± 14 years of age) in the 
USA found that swim -related injuries were significantly lower if the swimmers reported 
engagement in cross -training.  The injury prevalence in swimmers that cross -trained 
was inversely related to age (p<0.05).63 
Relationship between volume of training and prevalence of injury  
Sein et al. found a significant correlation between volume of training and shoulder 
impingement in elite swimmers.64 Atilla et al . found no significant correlation between  
volume of swimming training and the prevalence  of injuries  in Turkish masters 
athletes .54 Barry et al . concluded in a review of articles that reported the relationship 
between training load and pain, injury  and illness, was unclear.51 One study found a 
negative association between training load and musculoskeletal pain.65 This finding 
was later explained by the  injury prevention paradox , which states  that a low training 
load may make  an athlete less prepared for competition and more susceptible to 
injury .66

 Medication used to treat chronic disease and/or injuries  
An on -line survey completed by 19  304 m asters athletes participating in the 2017 
Sydney WMG and the 2018 Pan Pacific masters championship showed that 48.1% 
had a chronic condition and that 25.3% took medication to treat their condition. 
Chalmers et al. found the most prevalent conditions treate d by medication was AST, 
CVD, MBD , RA/OA  and DM.10 In a s urvey by Walsh et al. at the 2009 Sydney WMG , 
the most common prescribed medication used by masters athletes were HTN 
medication (7.4%), NSAIDs (6.4%), hypolipidemic  medication  (4.9%) and 
bronchodilators (4%).9  
A pre -race on -line survey of 15  778 endurance runners in the 2012 Two Oceans 
Marathon in South Africa found that 14.8% of participants  used chronic prescription 
medication.  The same study  found that 15 .6% of the partici pants  used analgesics, 
NSAIDs and cortisone before or during races.20 Other international s tudies  showed 
NSAID and analg esic usage in female recreational runners (34.6%) and NSAID usage 
in triathletes (84%), in runners (71%) and in cyclists (53%).19, 67 A study on 1  953 
recreational triathletes , aged between 18  - 80, showed the use of PEDs  (14.2%) in the 
year preceding the survey  and painkillers (11. 1%) during the three months before a 
competition.68 
Gorski et al . surveyed 327 triathletes competing at the 2008 Brazil Ironman triathlon 
and reported 59.9% of the athletes used NSAID s three  months before the competition  
with 47.4% being consumed the day before or during the race. The predominant 
reason for taking the medication before the race was to treat injuries  and during the 
race was to prevent pain . Most of the consumption (48.5%) occurred  without medical 
prescription  and the  athletes  were unaware of the negative  side effects of the 
medication.69 
Relationship between medication used before or during competition  and 
the sporting code  
The use of medication shortly before o r during competition differ widely between 
different types of sport. Usage of medication, NSAID’s and painkillers to reduce pain 
and manage musculoskeletal injuries just before and during elite competitions has 
 
 
 
 
©©  UUnniivveerrssiittyy  ooff  PPrreettoorriiaa   
34 
 been reported in sports such as football (69%) , triathlon (9.2%) and track and field 
athletics (44%).70-72 This indicates that medication use might be sport specific.  
Doping  
Some of the prescribed and OTC medication used by masters swimmers to manage 
and treat chronic disease and/or injury may harm the athlete ’s health and can be 
performance enhancing. The use of some of these substances are prohibited before 
and during competitions.11, 12 To this end an understanding of the concept of doping, 
doping control and the use of prohibited sub stances are necessary in the South African 
masters swimmer s context.   
Definition of doping  
Doping was define d by Nolte et al . as ‘the collective term used to describe the use of 
prohibited substances or methods to enhance performance ’.15 The PEDs and methods 
listed on the WAD A prohibited list can enhance adaptation to training and/or directly 
improve performance in competition.  
WADA lists different categories for doping infringements as:  
• Substances and Methods Prohibited at All Times (in and out of competition)  
• Substances and Methods Prohibited In -Competition  
• Substances Prohibited in particular sports12 
The prohibited list  
WADA maintains a list of mon itored substances and a list of prohibited substances 
that is reviewed on an annual  basis.12, 73 A prohibited substance can include a wide 
variety of substances such as prescribed medication, dietary substances, 
supplements, stimulants, anabolic agents such as steroids and illicit drugs such as 
cannabis. It also includes doping methods such as blood and gene manipulation. The 
substances that WADA  list as banned must meet two of three criteria namely: (1) it is 
potentially performance enhancing, (2) it has the potential to harm the athlete’s health  
and (3) it violates the spirit of the sport.16

 Doping infringements by  masters swimmers  
In terms of the studies reviewed the  possible doping i nfringements  committed  by South 
African masters swimmers was divided  into: (1) swimmers taking long-term prescribed 
medication to treat  chronic disease, (2) swimmers taking prescribed or OTC  
medication  to treat illness  and/or injury  shortly  before or during competition  and (3) 
swimmers taking lifelong  or current PEDs with the sole purpose  to improve 
performance.   
(1) Doping infringements through chronic prescribed medication  
In the 2017 Sydney WMG and the 2018 Pan Pacific masters championship survey of 
817 masters ’ athletes, researchers found that 25.3% used medication to treat a 
chronic health condition. The most common medication used were AST medication 
(26.6 %) and CVD medi cation (23.4%). Of the medication used, 40% were  on the 
prohibited list . These substances were Beta -2 antagonists and glucocorticoids used 
to treat AST and low blood pressure, Beta -blockers used in the treatment of HT N and 
other heart conditions, diuretics used to manage fluid retention , hormone s, metabolic 
regulators  and stimulants used in the treatment of DM and obesity.10  
In an international study by Campian et al. on ultra -marathon runners, 19.8% of the 
runners reported that they had in their lifetime used PEDs prescribed for medical 
reasons.26 
(2) Doping infringements before and during competition  
A study in 2016 on 136 female amateur runners reported that 34.6% used medication 
24 hours before races. The estimated 24 -hour doping prevalence for these runners 
was 8.1%, with pain killers and NSAIDs being the most self -administered drugs.74 
(3) Prevalence of PEDs used to improve performance  
Doping prevalence is mostly estimated by looking at the positive doping statistics 
accumulated by WADA and by analysing surveys and questionnaires completed by

36 
 elite athletes . WADA only reported 1.42% adverse analytical findings in 2018 in the 
344 177 test samples taken globally .75 
A review of doping prevalence studies in elite athletes in 2014 , found that the 
estimated current doping prevale nce ranges between 14  - 39% and the lifetime doping 
prevalence in the review was estimated to be 3.1%.23 A late r study on Danish athletes 
in 2017 found that on average 26% of athletes were estimated to have doped in their 
career .24 The prevalence of doping in elite athletes w as found to be variable depending 
on the s port, country, training groups and levels of competition .23 
Lately, the focus of research has shifted from research on elite athletes to the doping 
practices of amateur or recreational athletes. Two studies by Seifarth et al.79 and Hellar 
et al.87 on recreational Ironman and Half -Ironman athletes (1  076) and triathletes  (1 
989), found lifelong prevalence of d oping to be 13% and the 12 -month prevalence to 
be 14.2%.  A study conducted on 609 ultra -marathon runners 18 years and older 
reported 8.4% use of PEDs during competition and training, the most used PED’s 
being cannabis, narcotics  and stimulants.26 A study on 800 amateur athletes and 
exercisers reported a lifetime prevalence for do ping of 18.3%.76 
Health implications of doping  
In a review by Bird et al ., evidence was found that PEDs taken by elite and non -elite 
athletes  carry  considerable health risks in training and competition . The researchers 
identified articles that linked PED use to health risks for chronic diseases such as CVD , 
DM, cancer  and MPD .77  
Küster et al . surveyed 2010 participants in the Bonn marathon and found that the 
ingestion of pain medication immediately before the race was linked to serious 
gastrointestinal adverse events. They reported that 93% of the athletes who took the 
medication were unaware of the pos sible side effects.78 
Relationship between m otivat ion for participation and doping behaviour  
Dionigi  and O'Flynn showed through performance discourses, that competitive 
masters swimmers are not only focused on  the benefits of swimming such as improved

37 
 health and prolonging of life , but many masters swimmers strive to improve their 
performance and are highly motivated to excel in competition.79 Locally th is can be 
seen when looking at the results of the 2020 South African masters long course 
swimming championships where 30 swimmers achieved South African national 
colours, placing them in the FINA top ten tabulation for their a ge group.35  
Lazuras et al.  conducted a study on 800 young amateur athletes and exercisers in five 
European countries and showed that participants  were motivated to use PEDs to 
achieve results faster, to push themselves to physical limits  and to recover faster after 
training.80 A study on ultra -marathon ru nners showed that more competitive runners 
were using PEDs to gain a competitive edge as winning would lead to increased 
sponsorships, prize money  and/or national recognition.26 Having a stronger motivation 
for competition and winning, rather than intrinsic enjoyment and self -improvement can 
lead to higher doping i ntentions and behaviour.81 These studies showed a link between 
motivation to compete and possible doping intentions.  
Other relationships  with doping  
In the study by Seifarth et al. on recreat ional triathletes in Germany , researchers linked 
doping to gender , with females potentially using more PEDs . They also found that  
athletes with more than 10 years of experience in sport (9.4%), athletes older than 39 
years (9.8%)  and athletes training more than eight hours per week (8.0%)  had an 
increased prevalence of doping .68 
Attitudes of athletes towards  doping  and doping by competitors  
A positive attitude towards doping has been correlated with the intention to use PEDs 
or the actual practice of doping.82, 83 
Vargo et al . used the PEAS 8 -item instrument to measure attitude towards doping in 
98 university students (mean age = 24 ± 5.98 years) with different sporting 
backgrounds and motivations. The athletes average score was 18.473 ± 8.612 (2.309 
± 1.076 average score per question) with females scoring significantly lower (14.242 
± 3.307) tha n males (21.088 ± 9.869).84 A meta  review by Folkers et al . found five 
studies that showed a significant correlation between doping attitude and gender.83

38 
 To understand why athletes,  use PEDs , various models were developed to better 
understand the social and psychological processes underlying doping. One of these 
models developed for the sporting environment is the Sport Drug Control Model .85 The 
model describe s the factors th at can influence doping attitudes  namely : (1) the threat 
of being caught or ill health, (2) the benefits such as prize money  and/or sponsorships, 
(3) the opinions of fellow competitors or significant others, (4) the moral belief of the 
athlete that doping is right or wrong, (5) the ability of regulating bodies to test and 
regulate according to the law  and (6) the personality of the athlete including traits such 
as optimism and self -esteem.86 Later research has shown that moral belief, benefit 
appraisal  and threat appraisal have the strongest relationships with attitude towards 
doping in elite athletes.87 
Threat appraisal  
A study on 250 Australian elite athletes indicated that the Goldman dilemma might no 
longer be valid for elite athletes. The original Goldman dilemma presented athletes 
with a choice between the use of PEDs that guarantee performance and glory but  
caused d eath in five years’ time.  In this study , only one athlete was willing to sacrifice 
longevity for winning through doping.88 This might also hold true for masters athletes , 
as they are highly motivated to participate for health and longevity reasons.27, 89  
Benefit appraisal  
There is a correlation between increased doping and increased age in elite swimmers. 
As athletes get closer to the end of their careers , they weigh up the consequence of 
being caught doping with economic gain .90 The main motivators to train and compete 
for masters athletes is identified as sociali sation and to improve health  and not 
extrinsic motivators such as economic gain.27, 29 
Reference group influences  
The decision to dope is highly influenced by the doping attitudes of friends and fellow 
competitors , as well as perceptions about the prevalence of doping use among 
competitors. A 2014 m eta-analysis of personal and psychosocial predictors of doping 
use in physical activity  found that athletes were more likely to dope if their friends

 doped.91 It can be theorized that if masters swimmers have a lenient attitude towards 
their fellow competitors taking PEDs solely to improve performance, it might 
encourage them to self -use PEDs through the “false consensus effect .”92 
Personal morality  
The belie f that doping is right or wrong may influence l eniency to wards doping and 
can be an accurate predictor for self -use of PEDs.91, 93, 94 A study in 2012 , concluded 
that participants  aged 15  - 60 years  hold more negative attitudes t owards doping to 
improve performance , but were positive to  drugs for restoring physical functioning 
conditions. The study found that athletes were lenient towards doping up to the age of 
25, but showed decreased leniency at older ages.95  
Legitimacy  
The ability of regulating bodies to test and regulate doping according to the law , plays 
a role in attitude s towards doping. The regulatory structure for doping control of 
masters athletes in South Africa is complex. The summary below will highlight the  
current doping control structures  and policies for masters swimmers in South Africa.   
Doping structures and co ntrol  
WADA was formed in 1999 to control and regulate global anti -doping policy through 
the implementation of several international standards for testing, laboratories, the 
prohibited list, TUE  applications  and to protect athletes ’ rights. One of the purpo ses of 
the world anti -doping code is stated as: “To protect the Athletes’ fundamental right to 
participate in doping -free sport and thus promote health, fairness and equality for 
athletes  world -wide.”16  
WADA regulations are enforced by their International Federations (IFs). IFs are tasked 
with tes ting in and out of competition, providing education and sanctioning non -
compliant athletes. FINA as one of the sports under the Association of Summer 
Olympic I Fs controls doping in swimming.  In line with WADA, one of the principle 
objectives of FINA is to provide fair and drug free sport .96

40 
 WADA defines an athlete as any person  who compete s in sport at an international 
level (as defined by IF s) or a national level (as defined by each National Anti -Doping 
Organization (NADO).  They give NADOs the right to bring any level of athlete , even 
recreational athletes , into the definition of an athlete. This gives NADOs the discretion 
to apply the code and its policies, rules and regulations to any athlete registered with 
them. South Africa is a registered WADA supported Regional Anti-Doping 
Organisation (RADO).  
The South African  Institute for Drug -Free Sport (SAIDS) was created by the South 
African government under the Department of Sport and Recreation as a national 
agency to control drug free sport in the country. SAIDS work s closely with WADA and 
the African RADOs. Masters swimmers competing in the South African national 
championships need to be registered w ith SSA and thus fall under regulation by the 
SAIDS through the South African  Drug -Free Sport Act.  This act is compliant with 
WADA ’s international regulations and policies.97 
Doping control in the masters swimmer  context  
All FINA rules and regulations, as well as doping controls are valid for masters as one 
of the FINA disciplines. However, in the specific FINA Rules for masters competitions 
no mention is made about use of chronic medication, application for TUE and the 
consequences of using PEDs.32 FINA place s national bodies in this case SSA in 
charge of ensuring that athletes are in good standing and comply with the FINA 
regulations.17 This is carried into the SSA constitution as an objective to provide a drug 
free sport.98  
Enforcing doping policies  
WADA , FINA and SSA doping regulations apply to both elite and amateur athletes, 
but states that any event organiser holding an event for masters -level co mpetitors 
could elect to test but does not have to test for the full menu of PEDs. This might be 
why masters swimmers have been largely left out of anti -doping efforts.99 
Another complication for doping control might be the structure in which masters pool 
swimmers compete. Masters swimmers represent their club even when competing in 
 
 
 
 
©©  UUnniivveerrssiittyy  ooff  PPrreettoorriiaa   
41 
 swimming competitions like the  world championships. This rule is set out very clearly 
in the FINA general rules for masters as: “Individual entries shall only be accepted 
from persons representing clubs. No swimmer or team may be designated as 
representing a country or federation.“33 It was generated with the masters motto of fun, 
fitness and friendship  in mind, but may have conflicting implications for federations like 
SSA when it comes to doping control . This and the high cost of testing might explain 
why no drug testing is performed on masters swimmers in swimming competitions 
from local level to the FINA Masters World Championships.   
Doping knowledge  
The cornerstone of prevention of doping is education. Doping education is provided 
by WADA, the IF s and RADOs . They  supply athletes with the knowledge to prevent 
doping.  This education can take many forms e.g., doping policies, prohibited 
substances list s and brochures  on doping that are implemented through various 
platforms such as WADA's Anti -Doping Education and Learning Platform , websites  
and interactive  teaching.100 
Understanding the more t echnical components of this education , like the prohibited 
list, can be challenging to athletes. A survey by Orr et al . on 1 925 elite and sub -elite 
athletes showed that participants  differed in their knowledge of PEDs depending on 
their a ge, sex, ethnicit y, professional/amateur status  and current competition level .101 
Research has shown that RADOs provide sufficient information through the 
implementation of valuable knowledge -focused programs  on their websites .102  
Studies on younger athletes have found ambiguous results on doping education. A 
study on elite athletes  at Olympic  events found that 73.3% of the athletes received 
anti-doping education .103 A study conducted by  Morente -Sánchez et al.  on Spanish 
football players showed that 95% of participants did not know abou t WADA  and that  
97.4% did not know what the prohibited list was.104  
Houlihan pointed out that one of the limitations of doping education was that it was not 
aimed at specific stages of sport participation plan  where the last stage is aimed at 
masters participation . Educational context and campaigns should change with  the 
 
 
 
 
©©  UUnniivveerrssiittyy  ooff  PPrreettoorriiaa   
42 
 athletes as changes happen to their attitude, networks  and context  and as they 
progress through the LTPD participation stages. Athletes have a basic right to 
information in order to make informed choices when it comes to doping.105 
South African doctors and pharmacists play a role in prescribing and issuing medicine 
to masters athletes. A study by St arzak et al. found that these South African health 
professionals were lacking  doping -related knowledge and training and could as such 
not guide or monitor athletes ’ use of PEDs.106 
Consequences of doping and application  for exemption  
Application for T UEs 
Athletes suffering from chronic disease, who are taking prescribed medication , can 
apply for a TUE . The process of applying for a TUE is a long and complicated process 
that is based on the following criteria: (1) a thlete would experience significant 
impairment of health if the prohibited medication is withheld, (2) no enhancement of 
performance could re sult from the administration of the prohibited substance as 
medically prescribed, (3) the athlete would not be denied the prohibited substance if 
he/she was not a competing athlete, (4) no available permitted or practical alternative 
can be substituted for  the prohibited substance  and (5) retrospective approval would 
not be granted.107 
Theoretically, all masters swimmers diagnosed with a chronic disease that require 
treatment with medication on the prohibited list should apply for a TUE. It is clear from 
the definition above that some swimmers suffering from  chronic diseases would not 
be allowed a TUE under point (2). This would prevent them from competing and would 
in effect go against the masters aim of being inclusive.  
There are also reasons why masters would be hesitant to apply for TUE s. Studies 
have rep orted that using bronchodilators for AST management created a negative 
stigma towards athletes with AST and the use of inhalers . Masters athletes might be 
apprehensive of the perception of fellow athletes towards them taking possible PEDs , 
albeit inadverte ntly.108

 Literature study s ummary and conclusion  
During this literature study, only  three  age-comparable South African research studies 
were found. T wo studies were done on South African masters swimmers and they 
reported findi ngs on the motivations of open water swimmers and the prevalence  of 
shoulder injuries and the related risk factors.37, 65 The other South African study  
reported on the risk of medical complications  and medicine use in marathon runners 
during the 2012 Two Oceans Marathon. Two similar international studies by Halar et 
al.9 and Walsh  et al.55 used a WMG athlete population to report on the prevalence of 
chronic conditions, treatment strategies and sources of nutrition al information , as well 
as the health, injury and psychological  indices of t he participants.

 Chapter 3: Methodology  
Introduction  
This chapter contains an  overview of the study design, study setting, study population 
and sampling, statistical analysis and ethical considerations.  
Study  design  
The study used a cross -sectional design with descriptive, comparative and 
correlational statistical analysis that is detailed below. Cross -sectional studies survey 
the population at a single point in time, reflecting a cross -section of the population at 
the time the participant completes the questionnaire.109 A non -probability sample was 
taken through a web-based, online survey based  on the inclusion and exclusion 
criteria .110 The sampled masters swimmers completed the survey over a period of two 
months.  
The survey was planned using the recommendati ons of the Checklist for Reporting 
Results of Internet E -Surveys  (CHERRIES) guidelines (Appendix B).111 
Study setting  
The research setting refers to the place or location where the data w as collected. The 
survey was only d istributed to masters swimmers in South Africa.  
Study population and sampling  
The study population consisted of South African competitive and recreational masters 
swimmers. The sample was taken from the study population as delimited by the 
inclusion and e xclusion criteria listed below.  
Inclusion criteria:  
• Masters swimmers that are 18 years and older  
Exclusion criteria:  
• Informed consent not competed

 Sampling method and data collection  
A web -based, online questionnaire was used to collect quantitative data  based on the 
aims and objectives of the study. Due to the failure to attain permission to use the 
aQuellé Midmar Mile database to distribute the questionnaires, the initial purposive 
sampling of the swimmers in the SAMS database was broadened to snowball 
sampling to target both competitive and recreational masters swimmers. The SAMS 
database  was selected as the initial distribution channel. Swimmers on the database 
were asked in the introduction letter to further distribute  the survey to known masters 
swim mers and coaches.   
Online survey platform selection  
The Google Forms application was used for the survey as it levied no response 
dependent charge. It allowed participants to use multiple devices such as computers 
and cellular phones. It also offered struc tured data delivery via an excel spreadsheet 
that limited data capture errors.  
Data collection process  
An introductory email and the survey link were forwarded to SAMS for distribution. The 
introductory  email described  the context and purpose of the survey . Participation in 
the study was anonymous and voluntary.  
As the researcher is a well -known coach and masters swimmer, personal telephonic 
follow -ups with the SAMS regions, clubs and coaches were done throughout the 
survey period. A reminder to complete th e survey was emailed via the platform, one 
month after the initial survey distribution. The survey was closed two months after 
distribution started.  
Sample size  
In 2020, the SAMS database had 556 registered swimmers. The aQuellé Midmar Mile 
database cont ained over 15  000 recreational and competitive open -water masters 
swimmers. It was estimated at the date of proposal that the survey would result in a 
4% response rate (max 450 participants) in line with previous and similar research.10

46 
 A total of 360 masters swimmers responded to the survey. One swimmer did not agree 
to the informed consent and was filtered out of the survey.  
Design of the questionnaire  
In setting the questions care was taken to make the questions concise and easy to 
understand in swimming related  language.112, 113 Most of the questions were closed -
ended with an appropriate answer set that includ ed a non -response option such as 
“not applicable” or “I would rather not say.”  Only a limited n umber of open -ended 
questions were included to ensure minimum data manipulation.  
The survey was divided into 11 sections, with a total of 36 questions. In order to 
improve the survey completion rate the sections and number of questions were 
carefully selec ted to minimise the survey completion time.114 
The first section focused on obtaining informed consent from the participant to partake 
in the study as well as POPIA consent for the use of the data.  
The second section obtained biographical information about the participant for 
example, the age group, g ender, and medical aid subscription status. Only participants  
18 years and older were allowed to complete the questionnaire.  
The third section asked questions pertaining to the participants’ experience in 
swimming, for example , the volume of training per week and the number of years the 
participant has been swimming. Participants were also asked when they last competed 
in an organised sporting event and to specify the level and type of event.  
The fourth section offered a choice of nine reasons for swimmin g with an open -ended 
option to list any reasons not included. Swimmers were asked to mark the three 
predominant reasons why they swim.  
The next sections of the questionnaire all included filtering questions. These  questions 
were used to guide participants through the sections and to shorten the questionnaire 
completion time . For example, if swimmers reported no chronic disease, they were not 
asked to complete the chronic disease and associated medication section.

47 
 Sections five and six dealt with chronic di sease and the associated chronic medicine 
use. The  WHO focusses their global statistics and prevention initiatives mostly around 
the most prevalent chronic diseases namely CVD, stroke, cancer, chronic respiratory 
diseases and DM2.6 Medical schemes in South Africa developed a CDL list that covers 
26 chronic conditions (Appendix C) .39 The CDL is used to manage prescription of 
medication used to treat chronic disease in South Africa. The selection options given 
were based on the CDL, but included an open -ended option to add any dise ase not 
listed.  
Section seven focussed on any i njuries that were sustained by the participants in the 
five years preceding the survey. This period was extended from the original time -frame 
due to limited training and competitions which took place during th e COVID -19 
pandemic.  
Section eight surveyed the medication used to treat injuries or illness shortly before or 
during competitions. To help participants answer this question the following guidelines 
were given. “Were you prescribed any injections, medicat ions and/or did you buy any 
OTC medication, to treat an injury or any illness, suffered SHORTLY BEFORE OR 
DURING COMPETITIONS? This may include cortisone injections or tablets, NSAIDS, 
any pain tablets, cold and flu medication, cough syrups or any other me dications that 
you may have used.”  
Section nine used the PEAS questionnaire developed by Petróczi to determine the 
expressed attitude of the masters swimmers towards doping.115 Nicholls et al. 
converted the original 17 -item PEAS instrument to the 8 -item version, suitable to 
measure doping attitudes in adults.93, 116 The 8 -item version has a bett er focus on sport 
drugs and excludes the use of recreational drugs in sporting environments and 
external factors such as the influence of media attention.117 This section of the 
questionnaire also included questions on the swimmers’ attitude towards fellow 
competitors’ use of medication that may enhance performance.  
Section 10 focussed on the life -long and current i ntentional use of prohibited 
substances or methods to improve performance. Due to the anonymous online survey 
process and the stated de-identification of data, it was decided to use  direct doping

48 
 questions and not indirect questioning techniques such as Randomized Response 
Technique (RRT) questions.118 Participants that indicated use were asked to detail the 
specific PEDs or methods used to improve performance.  
The last section of  the questionnaire tested the doping knowledge of the participants 
by asking questions about the WADA rules and regulations, the prohibited list and 
TUE application. Swimmers were also asked if they were aware of the consequences 
of committing doping rule violations.  
As a final check, the questionnaire was compared to the objectives of the study to 
make sure that all the relevant data elements that meet the objectives were 
included.113 The survey questionnaire is attached in Appendix D.   
Pilot study  
To test  the questionnaire structure and the question  clarity  a pilot study was conducted 
on 10 randomly selected masters swimmers in representative age groups. Their 
feedback on the s tructure , length an d question design  was used to improve the survey.  
Data preparation and statistical analysis  
Preparation of the data  
Data from Google forms were returned to the researcher in an Excel spreadsheet 
format. No manual input of data was done.  
The data were pre pared and screened for omissions by the researcher under the 
guidance of the statistician. Questionnaires that were not fully completed were 
carefully screened to ensure reliability of the data.  
Grouping of medication and comparison with the prohibited li st was completed by a 
registered pharmacist using the EMGuidance  application.

 Statistical analysis and tests  
Statistical analysis of the data was done using SPSS data analysis software version 
28. Analysis of the data variables by type, categories and t he statistical calculations 
performed are set out in Appendix E.  The statistical significance for this research was 
set at 5%. 
Descriptive data analysis  
Descriptive statistics were used to summarise and describe the biographic data of the 
participants  (age, gender, medical aid), motive and swimming experience (systematic 
training, number of year s training in swimming, competitions attended).   
Frequency or number of swimmers that responded to a question category (n) and 
percentages (%) of the total study population (N) were calculated for the variables. 
Confidence Intervals (CI) were calculated for means and percentages. The 95% CI is 
defined as  "a range of values for a variable of interest constructed so that this range 
has a 95% probability of including the true value of the variable”.119 The format used 
to document the range of possible values in this dissertation was 95% CI (LL,UL) were  
LL represents the lower lim it of the confidence interval and UL represents the upper 
limit.  
For the categorical age variable, the mean age was calculated using mid -point coding. 
The Standard Deviation (SD) calculated shows the variation of individual reported 
ages from this mean value.120 
Volume -load was categorised using low (0 - 4.9 km per week), medium (4.9 - 11.9 km 
per week) and high volume -load (12 km and more per week) categories as per Kruger 
et al.65  
To determine if the participants represented both c ompetitive and recreational 
swimmers , an analysis of the events entered, as well as an analysis of the 
competitiveness of the swimmers  was done.  
 
 
 
 
©©  UUnniivveerrssiittyy  ooff  PPrreettoorriiaa   
50 
 Events were analysed in four categories namely pool swimming, combined events 
such as triathlons, open water a nd other events. Events percentages were further 
analysed according to the event level.  
Motivations to train and compete in swimming were compared to other similar studies 
on swimmers and other athletic populations. Motivation to compete and win was 
analy sed for later comparison to doping attitude and intentional doping.  
The calculated prevalence reflect s the frequency of disease or injury, expressed as a 
percentage of the total participants at the time of the survey.120 Chronic  disease 
prevalence  was split for the different age groups to determine if the prevalence differed 
between the age groups.  
Chronic disease prevalence was further analysed for different age sub -sets (all ages, 
25 years and older and 50 years and older), for the number of chronic diseases per 
participant and for type of chronic disease , to make it comparable to the literature. 
Other chronic disease s, listed under the open -ended question , were described.  
The prevalen ce of injury was analysed by body region, type of shoulder injury and age.  
Chronic disease and injury prevalence was compared for males and females.  
After calculating the frequencies, percentages and prevalence as detailed above , it 
was compared to releva nt studies that were identified in the literature review.  
Prevalence of injury for age sub -sets (all ages, 25 years and older) were calculated to 
make the data comparable to similar studies found in the literature.  
The prevalence of chronic disease and injury w ere compared to that of  other athletic 
populations , as well as with the general population . To compare the prevalence of 
chronic disease in the study with South African medical aid data, the study data were 
age-adapted. This involved removing the s tudy participants in the age group 18  - 24 
from the analysis of chronic data as the Cairncross et al . data contained the age 
groups 15  - 19 years and 20  - 24 years and as such could not be directly compared.39 
Medication use was analysed and expressed as a percentage of total participants. The 
percentage of participants , using prescribed chronic medicine , was calculated for each 
 
 
 
 
©©  UUnniivveerrssiittyy  ooff  PPrreettoorriiaa   
51 
 gender, combined genders, and age groups. Medication use was further analysed to 
determine most prescribed chronic medications. Possible doping infringements were 
determined by inputting each of the listed medications in the EMGuid ance  application 
for comparison with the Prohibited List.  
Medication use d was then compared to the type of, and percentage  of chronic 
medication use and OTC medication use shortly before or during competition , with 
what was  found in the literature for othe r athletic populations.  
The attitudes of participants towards doping was analysed using the PEAS -8 scale.82 
The PEAS -8 questionnaire is attached in Appendix F. The PEAS instrument is judged 
by a 6 -point Likert -type scale (strongly disagree (1), disagree (2), slightly disagree (3), 
slightly agree (4), agree (5) to strongly agree (6)), with a range of scores betw een 8 
and 48, setting the theoretical middle -point at 28. The mean scores and SD of the 
PEAS instrument were calculated . Scale scores larger than 28 (or 3.5 per item on the 
6-point scale) were interpreted as a more positive or lenient attitude toward dopin g.83  
Swimmers’ attitude towards fellow competitors’ use of chronic medication and 
intentional doping for performance enh ancement was calculated. The questions were 
scored by using  a 5-point Likert -type scale ( (1) strongly disagree; (2) disagree; (3) 
neither agree nor disagree; (4) agree; and (5) strongly agree ) with a range of scores 
between one and five . The mean scores an d SD for the questions were determined 
and evaluated against the midpoint  of three. Scale scores larger than three per item 
were interpreted as a more positive or lenient attitude toward fellow competitors use 
of chronic medication and intentional doping.  The mean scores for attitude towards 
doping and attitude towards fellow competitors doping were compared to studies found 
in the literature.  
Both t he previous and current prevalence of doping were calculated as a percentage 
of total participants.  
Doping k nowledge about WADA, the Prohibited List, sources of doping information 
and TUE application was analysed and described. The percentage of swimmers that 
was aware of the consequences of doping was calculated.

52 
 Comparative data analysis  
To compare different sub -sets of data, independent samples T -tests were used. A T-
test is  a statistical test that is used  to compare the means of two data sub -sets in order 
to see if they  differ from one another.121 Parametric a nd non -parametric T -tests were 
conducted depending on how the data were distributed.122, 123 
The independent sub -sets of data that were compared are listed below:  
• Swimmers with and without chronic disease were tested against each of the 
motivations  
• Swimmers with  and without chronic disease were tested against gender  
• Swimmers with and without injury were tested against each of the motivations  
• Swimmers with and without injury were tested against gender  
• Swimmers with a competitive motivation and swimmers with a non-competitive 
motivation were tested against types of injury  
• Swimmers that competed in triathlons (regularly cross -trained by cycling and 
running) and swimmers that only competed in swimming events were tested for 
differences in injury status  
• Males and fem ales were tested for different PEAS mean scores  
• Swimmers with a competitive motivation and swimmers with non -competitive 
motivation were tested for different PEAS mean scores  
Correlation between variables  
As defined by Schober et al. “Correlation coefficients quantify the strength of a linear 
(Pearson correlation) or monotonic (Spearman correlation) relationship between two 
continuous variables”.124 The correlation coefficient ( r) determines the significance or 
strength of the correlations and was interpreted as: 0.00 –0.10 negligible correlation, 
0.10–0.39 weak correlation, 0.40 –0.69 moderate correlation, 0.70 –0.89 strong 
correlation, 0.90 –1.00 very strong correlation.125  
Pearson’s c orrelation calculations were  done between the following variables:

 • Age and chronic disease  
• Age and number of chronic diseases  
• Chronic  disease, number of years swimming, volume -load, and the distance 
per session  
• Volume -load and injury

 Approval of the study  
On completion of the study proposal, permissi on to proceed with the study was 
obtained from the Faculty of Health Science s’ MSc Committee (Appendix G). 
Permission was obtained from the governing body of masters swimming in South 
Africa, SAMS , to distribute the survey to their members (Appendix H). A secondary 
request was sent to the organiser of the aQuellé Midmar Mile  swim, Mr W Ridden, to 
distribute the survey to all participants 18 years and older, who had previously 
competed in the open wa ter swim. This request for distribution was unfortunately 
denied.  
Ethical considerations  
Great care was taken to adhere to ethical requirements and specifically in making the 
survey Protection of Personal Information Act  (POPIA) compliant. POPIA came into  
effect on 1 July 2021 and had implications on all research activities that involved the 
collection, processing and storage of personal information.  Actions taken to adhere to 
the act , included making data collection anonymous and voluntary, attaining cons ent 
from participants to share their data and adding a declaration by the researcher in the 
questionnaire. Only participants that provided informed consent w ere allowed to 
compete the survey.  
Ethical clearance (193/2021) was granted by the Faculty of Health Sciences Research 
Ethics Committee . The study was carried out following the ethical standards laid down 
in the 1964 declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments (Appendix A).  
Data protec tion 
The data collect ed contained personal and other sensitive information on health status 
and doping practice. For this reason, the data will be kept confidential. The electronic 
metadata will be uploaded to the University of Pretoria Research Data Repos itory 
system at the end of the study for the prescribed minimum period. The declaration of 
data storage is included in Appendix I. Data collected in the online survey will be used 
in this study only and will not be made available for any other research.

 Chapter 4: Findings  
Demographic data analysis  
Age distribution  
The 359 masters swimmers that completed the survey selected  five-year age 
categories as defined in the previous section on age range of swimmers included in 
the survey.  The age range was 18  - 89 years. The mean age of 51.3 years, 95% C I 
(49.8, 52.7) for the participants  was determined using mid -point coding. Figure 2 below 
shows the age distribution of the participants .

Gender  
The gender distribution showed that 50.7% (n=182) of the participants  were female 
and 48.7% (n=175) were male. Two participants  did not disclose their gender.  A study 
population pyramid showing an overview of the age and gender distribution of the 
particip ants is shown in Figure 3.

Medical aid  
The percentage of  participants  that subscribed to a medical aid was  96.1%, 95% C I 
(94.1, 98.1). This question was included for possible comparison  of participants  health 
status with that reported in medical aid statistics. Medical aid data on chronic diseases 
were available to the researcher and adaptation of a ge groupings of the statistics 
made c omparisons possible.39

 Swim training volume -load per week  
Two participants did not respond to this question. To compare the results of this study 
to previous research, it was necessary to calculate the training volume -load for the 
participants. Although most articles that use swimming -related training load used t he 
hours per week that swimmers train to determine training load, two surveys conducted 
on adult swimmers by De Almeida et al .63 and Kruger et al .76 calculated training load 
by multiplying the number of training sessions done per week by the average distance 
that swimmers trained during a session.  Kruger et al . also categori sed training load 
per week in masters swimmers into low (0  - 4.9 km per week), medium (4.9  - 11.9 km 
per week) and high volume -load (12  km and more per week)  categories .65 Similar 
categories were used to determine swimming volume -load for the participants  and the 
results are summarised in Table 3 below .  
Table 3: Volume -load per week  
Volume -load category  n Percentage (%) 
Low (0  - 4.9 km/w)  106 29.5 
Medium ( 4.9 - 11.9 k m/w)  227 63.2 
High ( 11.9 + km/w)  24 6.7 
 
The calculated training -volume show ed that most swimmers follow ed a medium 
regime of training, swimming between five and 12  km per week.

Years of swimming  
Swimming experience or life -time exposure was defined by Feijen et al. as the number 
of years swimmers participated competitively .126 To be inclusive for recreational 
swimmers this definition was adapted for this study  by not referring to competitiveness. 
The response s to the question ‘How many years have you been swimming?’ are listed 
in Table 4. Table 4: Number of years swimming

 Competitions attended  
In this section the  participants  were asked three questions.  
Question 1: ‘Have you competed in an organised sporting event that included 
swimming in the last five years ? This includes social, non-competitive,  and fun events 
for example the Polar Bear swim.’  
The relatively long reporting interval of five years was ch osen due to the COVID -19 
pandemic restrictions that limited events in the two years preceding the study. For this 
question 89.1%, 95% C I (86.0, 92.2) of participants  indicated that they competed in 
an event in the last five years.  
Question 2: ‘Please specify the event(s). You can choose more than one option.’  
Participants  were given four categories of events to choose from namely triathlon , 
Ironman, open water  swimming , pool and an option to specify other events. 
Participants  could  choose more than one category of event i.e. one participant  could 
indicate participation in triathlon , Ironman competitions and open water swimming. The 
results for triathlon  and Ironman competition were combined as they include the same 
sporting codes at  different distances , with  Ironman being a specific type of triathlon. 
Participants  then had to indicate the level at which they competed namely local, 
regional, national and/or international. They could indicate more than one level of 
competition. It was clear that this question confused specifically the open water 
swimmers as they did not know how to categorise events as local, regional  and 
national.  
Question 3: ‘Please specify the event or events that you train for. Separate your events 
with a comma (,).’ One hundred and two participants indicated that they competed in 
other events. A nalysis of the open -ended question where swimmers could indicate 
what events they took part in resulted in most swimmers indicating that they train for 
the SAMS nationals championships, triathlon/Ironman and the Midmar Mile open 
water swim.

 Several other events were specified namely cold -water swimming (18), fun events (6), 
lifesaving (3), religious events  (2), and combination events (10). Combination events 
included biathle, biathlon and duathlon. Although the combination events could 
theoretically be com bined with triathlon  it was decided not to do so. The reason being 
that the question could be interpreted as events participant s aspire to compete in and 
not necessarily events in which they have  already competed in. Twelve participants  
replied that they t rained for health and fitness only.  Table 5 shows the analysis of the 
number of swimmers that competed in triathlon, pool, open water  swimming and other 
events against the competition level  selected .  
Table 5: Analysis of events  
Analysis of the events show ed that 27.5% of swimmers tak e part in triathlon and 
Ironman events, 56.7% in pool events and 66.9% in open water events.  
Motivation to train and compete in swimming  
Every swimmer could choose three motivations for why they swim. No ranking was 
perform ed for the motivations  selected. The motivations selected by the participants  
are shown as a percentage of total participants  in Table 6. Although two participants  
selected other motivations, they did not specify what these motivations were.  Event  Percentage

Other  motivations  2 
The results show ed that most participants trained and competed to improve health 
and fitness. This was followed by the motivations to relieve stress and to have fun.  
Chronic disease prevalence  
In the first question of this section on chronic disease participants  were asked  to 
indicate if they have ever been diagnosed with chronic disease  by a health care 
provider. The options given were ‘yes, no, I am not sure , and I do not wish to disclose 
any chronic disease information ’. Four participants  indicated that they were not sur e if 
they had a chronic disease, they did however specify an actual chronic disease under 
the open question. These participants were added to the number of participants  that 
answered ‘yes’ to this question. One participant  did not want to disclose disease status 
and was excluded from the percentage calculations. The prevalence of chronic 
disease reported by the 358 participants  that completed the question on chronic 
disease prevalence was calculated as 39.1%, 95% CI (34 .0, 44.2). The prevalence  of 
chronic disease for the 350 participants  25 years and older was calculated as 38.7%, 
95% CI (3 3.6, 43.9). The prevalence  of chronic disease for the 192 participants  50 
years and older was calculated as 50.0%, 95% CI (4 2.9, 57.1).

 Analysis of prevalence of chronic disease split by gender  
The gender split for the 356 participants  (two participants  did not want to disclose their 
gender, one participant  did not want to disclose chronic disease information) show s 
that 34.9% , (n=61)  of the male participants  were diagnosed with a chronic disease 
compared to  43.1% , (n=78) of the females.    
Relationship between age and chronic disease  
An analysis of the relationship between age and the prevalence of chronic disease in 
an age grou p is shown in Table 7 below. One participant  did not want to disclose 
disease status and was excluded from the percentage calculations.

 There is a high prevalence of chronic disease in the younger age groups 18  - 24 years 
(57.1%) and 30  - 34 years (40.0%). From the age group of 34  - 39 years the prevalence 
of chronic disease gradually increase s up to the age group of 65  - 69 years, after which 
the older age groups shows a decline in chronic disease prevalence.  
Analysis of type of chronic disease  
In this section of the questionnaire participants  were given a selection of nine chronic 
diseases to select  from. They could pick more than one disease as well as specify any 
other diseases not on the list under an open -ended option. The diseases t hey could 
select were HTN, HLD, DM, AST, thyroid disease, C AD, heart disease, epilepsy  and 
BMD . One participant  did not want to disclose disease status and was excluded from 
the percentage calculations. One participant  indicated a chronic disease in questi on 
1, but did not specify type of disease and medication and was excluded from the data 
analysis in question 2. The data w ere evaluated by the medication specified and the 
participant was added to the MBD  type. 
An analysis of the selected and open -ended listed chronic diseases for different age 
groupings is given in Table 8 below.

 Number of chronic diseases per participant  
Participants could select an unlimited number of chronic diseases from the CDL of the 
ten most prevalent chronic diseases in South Africa. They could also specify any 
diseases not listed in an open -ended option. Table 9 below summarizes the number 
of chron ic diseases listed by swimmer as a percentage of the total number of  
participants  (n=358) .

The results showed that 22.4% of participants had only one chronic disease and that 
16.5% reported multi -morbidity. The maximum number of reported co -existing chronic 
diseases was five in the same individual. Multi -morbidity prevalence reported in males 
was 14.9% ( n=26 ) and in females 18.1% ( n=33 ).

Prescribed chronic medication for chronic disease  
In this section participants  were asked ‘Do you use any prescribed medication on a 
daily, weekly or monthly basis to treat your chronic disease? On answering yes, they 
were directed to an open -ended question where they could specify the medication 
used wit h the instruction ‘Please list the medication(s) that you are taking for your 
chronic disease(s). Please just enter the name of the medication. No need to give the 
dosage. Separate your medication names with a comma (,) ’. 
Analysis of the prescribed chronic  disease medication showed that 84.6% of the 
masters swimmers with a chronic condition took medication to treat their condition. In 
total 121 swimmers indicated that they used chronic medication. This makes t he total 
population prevalence of chronic medication use 33.7%, 95% CI (2 8.8, 38.6). Table 
10 below shows the number of swimmers taking medication per type of chronic 
condition.

bronchodilators.  
Possible doping infringements through the use of chronic medication  
Of the 121 swimmers that used medic ation to treat their chronic disease 3 4.7%, (n=42)  
were committing a possible doping offence. This makes the total population 
percentage of possible doping offences through the use of prescribed medication to 
treat chronic disease 11.4%. Table  11 below giv es a breakdown of the type of 
infringement.

Diuretics and masking agents that are mostly used for the treatment of hypertension 
were the most prescribed medication found on the prohibited list. This was followed 
by beta -2-antagonists used mostly to treat AST. Although one participant used a beta -
blocker, swimming is not one of the speci fied sports on the prohibited list and was 
excluded from the infringement calculations.  
Prevalence of injury  
In this section of the questionnaire participants were asked if they suffered any injury 
due to swimming that required treatment e.g., use of medic ation or required them to 
seek medical advice from a health professional in the last five years. The prevalence 
of injury split between the genders is summari sed in Table 1 2 below.

The prevalence of injuries in the 18  - 24 age group was the highest. The results show 
that prevalence of injuries mostly decrease with increased age.  
Shoulder injuries  
In this section swimmers were asked if they  suffered any of the following injuries to 
their shoulder s? The options given were swimmer ’s shoulde r and /or impingement, 
inflammation of tendons in shoulder or arm (tendinitis), rotator -cuff tear, OA and 
shoulder pain. Swimmers were allowed to choose more than one option or could 
specify an injury  not listed. The other shoulder injuries swimmers specif ied were AC

Analysis by type of shoulder injury show ed that tendinitis and impingement are the 
most reported shoulder injuries.  
Prescribed and OTC medication used shortly before and during  
competitions  
This section included two questions on medication used to treat injuries or illness 
shortly before or during competitions. The first being ‘Were you prescribed any 
injections, medications and/or did you buy any OTC  medication, to treat an injury or 
any ill ness, suffered SHORTLY BEFORE OR DURING COMPETITIONS? This may 
include cortisone injections or tablets, NSAIDS, any pain tablets, cold and flu 
medication, cough syrups or any other medications that you may have used. ’ Analysis 
of the prescribed and OTC  medication showed that 16.4%  of the participants took 
medication to treat  injury or illness  shortly before or during competitions . Table 1 6 
shows the percentages of the most prescribed  and OTC medication types used  by the 
swimmers  to treat injury or illness s hortly before or during competitions .

 Attitudes towards doping  
In this question swimmers were asked to express their attitude towards the intentional 
use of PEDs . They were asked to rate their answers as strongly disagree (1), disagree 
(2), slightly disagree (3), slightly agree (4), agree (5) to strongly agree (6). The mid-
point or mean score for each of the PEAS items is 3.5 and for the total of 8 -items is 
28. Values reported below these scores signify a negative or non -lenient attitude 
towards doping. The mean scores and SD  of the PEAS instrument are listed in Table 
18.

Swimmers ’ attitude towards fellow competitors doping  
In this section participants  were asked to rate their attitude towards fellow competitor 
use of medication and PEDs . The five questions were scored by using  a 5-point Likert -
type scale with a range of scores between one and five. They were asked to rate their 
answers as (1) strongly disagree; (2) disagree; (3) neither agree nor disagree; (4) 
agree; and (5) strongly agree. The mean score for the questions was 3. Th e mean 
score s and SD for the questions are listed in Table 20.

Intentional doping to improve performance  
This section included three questions on doping.  
Question 1: Have you ever intentionally used banned substances or methods to 
enhance your swimming  performance? It further specified that ‘This excludes the use 
of prescribed chronic medication or the unintentional use of performance enhancing 
medication to treat injury or illness. Remember that the questionnaire is anonymous  
and your identity is prote cted. Please be honest. ’ One male swimmer answer indicated 
the intentional use of a PED in this question.  
Question 2: Do you currently use a banned substance(s) or method(s) to enhance 
your sporting performance? All participants  answered ‘no’ to this question.

 Question 3: Please specify the drug or method that you use to improve your 
performance. This was an open -ended question. No swimmers completed  this 
question.  
Knowledge about doping  
In this section participants  were asked several questions pertaining to doping 
knowledge and w here they attained the knowledge .  
The first question asked if participants  were  familiar with the WADA website, anti -
doping rules, regulations  and policies . In response to this question 37.9% , (n=136)  of 
the masters swimmers answered ‘yes’.  
In the second question participants  could then indicate where they found doping 
information in a selection table with an open -ended option where they could further 
specif y sources . The selection and sources specified under the open question were 
categorised into Table 2 1.

 In the third question swimmers were asked if they have ever heard about the WADA 
prohibited list and to this question 57.4% (n= 206) of the participants  indicated ‘yes’. 
To the fourth question ‘ Have you ever asked your doctor if the medication he 
prescribed  is legal to use when taking part in sporting events?’, 24.5% , (n=88) of the 
participants  indicated that they  had asked.  
The next two questions t ested the participants  knowledge about TUEs and the 
application process for exemption. Question 1: Have you ev er applied for a 
Therapeutic Use Exemption (TUE) for YOURSELF in any sport?  This question 
resulted in 1.9% (n=7)  of the participants  indicating that they have applied for TUEs. 
Question 2: Have you ever applied for a Therapeutic Use Exemption (TUE) for a family 
member in any sport? Only three  swimmers (0.8%) answered yes to this question.    
In the  last question participants were asked if they were  aware of the consequences 
of committing anti -doping rule violations . To this question 70.2% , (n=252)  answered 
that they were aware of the consequences of doping.  
Results s ummary  
The survey resulted in 359 responses with 48.7%  male and 50.7% female swimmers  
completing the gender question . Two swimmers did not declare their gender. The 
mean age of the participants was 51.27  ± 1.5 years. The study population showed a 
representative sample of masters swimmers, with swimmers taking part in a variety of 
events na mely triathlon and Ironman (27.5%), pool events (56.7%) and open water 
events (66.9%). Most of the participants (61.3%) have been swimming for more than 
10 years, but a surprisingly high number of swimmers (17.8%) indicated that they have 
only recently (<  2 years) taken up swimming as a sport.  
The dominant motivation of the swimmers to train and compete in swimming was to 
improve health and fitness (85%), followed by the motivations to relieve stress (47.4%) 
and for enjoyment and to have fun  (45.5%).  In line with previous studies the swimmer’s 
motivation to compete and win  (16.2%) was a less dominant motivation.29, 37

 The prevalence of chronic disease in the master s swimmers was 39.1%  with females 
(43.1%) having a higher prevalence than male participants ( 34.9%).  The total 
populatio n prevalence of prescribed chronic medication use was 33.7%  with 11.4% 
committing a possible doping offence .  
Twenty -six percent of the p articipants reported injuries in the five years preceding the 
survey with injuries in the shoulder region most frequent ly reported and tendinitis being 
the most prevalent reported shoulder injury.  
Analysis of the prescribed and OTC medication showed that 16.4% took medication 
to treat injury or illness shortly before or during competitions , leading to 2.8% of the 
participants committing possible doping offences. The most used medication were 
NSAIDs, analgesics and cortisone.  
In the section on intentional doping by PEDs o r methods o nly one male swimmer 
indicated previous  use of a banned substance.  
The expres sed attitude of the participants on the PEAS 8 -item version showed scores 
considerably lower than the 3.5  midpoint score per question  indicating  that masters 
swimmers do not have a positive or lenient attitude toward doping. Specific questions 
set to test the swimmers ’ attitude towards chronic medication use , indicated that they 
believed that chronic medication helped masters swimmers to perform as healthy 
individuals and that this medication use should not be construed as doping.  
Participants showed limit ed knowledge ( 37.9%) of the WADA website, anti -doping 
rules, regulations  and policies . The most listed sources of doping information were 
social and news media (38.2%), family/friends (27.0%) and the WADA and SAIDS 
websites (25.6). Only 24.5% of the participants  indicated that they have ever asked 
their medical doctor if the medication they prescribed is legal to use when taking part 
in sporting events  and o nly 1.9% showed knowledge of TUEs. Counter to  the limited 
doping knowledge displayed by the swimmers 70.2% indicated that they were aware 
of the consequences of doping.

 Chapter  5: Discussion  
Response rate  
In the original planning the estimated number of responses using purposive sampling 
on both th e SAMS and Midmar databases, calculated at a 4%  response rate, indicated 
that the estimated  number of participants  would be 450. It was theorised that in using 
the two databases the survey would reach a mix of South African recreational and 
competitive masters swimmers competing in a variety of combination, pool, open -
water  and recreational events. Due to the failure to attain permission to distribute the 
survey to masters swimmers on the aQuellé Midmar Mile database, the study was 
adapted to use s nowball sampling. The snowball sampling technique was used to 
further distribute the questionnaire to an unknown number of masters coaches and 
masters swimmers resulted in 359 responses to the survey. Due to the use of this 
sampling method the response rate cannot be determined.  
Representative sample  
Although the survey was initially distributed to the SAMS database only, whic h mostly 
targeted pool swimmers, the snowball sampling resulted in a more representative 
sample with swimmers taking part in a variety of events namely triathlon  and Ironman 
(27.5%), pool events (56.7%) and open water events (66.9%). Masters swimmers 
participation in events showed representation at all event levels from recreation or fun 
events to  international events.  
Most of the participants (61.3%) have been swimming for more than 10 years, this is 
similar to the results in a study by Potdevin et al. co nducted on masters swimmers in 
France (21 years ± 13.5) that also showed long term engagement with the sport.  A 
surprisingly high number of swimmers (17.8%) indicated that they have only recently 
(< 2 years) taken up swimming as a sport.127

 Comparison of m otivation to swim  with other studies  
The dominant motivation to train and compete in swimming was to improve health and 
fitness (85%), followed by the motivations to relieve stress (47.4%) and to enjoy myself 
and have fun (45.4%). Only 23% of swimmers were  motivated by  social interaction 
and bein g with friends. These findings  differ from studies by Adams on WMG 
participants that found that the motives to  sociali se and compete with other 
participants were slightly more important than to improve my health.27 Walsh et al . 
found that the main motivation for females w as to sociali se and that of males w as to 
increase fitness and h ealth.29 Kruger et al . found that the motivation of swimmers 
differs dependin g on the event they partook in.37 They also found that competitors at 
the Midmar Mile w ere motivated for thr ee main reasons namely socialisation and 
escape, fun and entertainment and intrinsic achievement. In line with all these studies 
the motivation to compete and win  (16.2%) was a less dominant reason.  
Number of c hronic disease s compared to the g eneral p opulation  
Table 22 compares the number of diseases per participant with the general population 
statistics for adults 18 years and older in the USA and Australian health surveys. The 
prevalence of chronic disease in the South Afric an masters swimmers (39.1%) is lower 
than of the general population found in other studies  in the USA (50.8%) and Australia 
(47.0%) .45, 46

 Chronic disease s prevalence  compared to South African medical aid  data 
With 96.1%  of the participants subscribed to a medical aid, chronic disease prevalence 
reported in the study was compared  to medical aid data in Table 24. Cairncross et al. 
used different definitions to sample the medical aid data. The prevalence data using 
the more relaxed definition of chronic disease prevalence namely the count  of 
beneficiaries who have had at -least one claim for a specified CDL condition during the 
year was used for comparison with this study.39

 Comparison of the study results with the diseases prevalence for all ages  in Cairncross  
et al. , show conside rably better chronic disease prevalence for AST, CVD, DM, and 
HTN in the study population.39, 128 The values for arthritis could not be compared as 
the Cairncross  et al.  statistics only included RA as a chronic disease. This study 
combined all arthritis conditions namely RA, OA, ankylosing spondylitis and gout. MBD  
for this study included BMD, schizophrenia, depression and anxiety conditions. 
Cairncross  et al.  only included BPD and schizophrenia. The prevalence for BMD and 
HLD are higher for the study. This may be due to age discrepancies between the 
compared data.  
To better compare the study data with the medical aid data in Cairncross  et al. , the 
data was age -adapted to only include the age-groups of 25 years and older. The age-
adapted chronic disease prevalence is compared in Table 25.

 Comparison of the study results with the diseases prevalence in the different age 
groups reported to that of Cairncross  et al.39 and Westaway128, show considerably 
better chronic disease prevalence for CAD, DM, epilepsy , HTN, HLD and thyroid 
disease (25+ age group) in the study population. Hypothyroidism in the CDL was 
broadened to thyroid disease in the study to include all diseases of the thyroid.  This 
may be why the 50+ age group in the study shows higher prevalence of thyroid 
disease.  
The values for arthritis could not be compared as the Cairncross  et al.  statistics only 
included RA as a chronic disease. This study combined all arthritis conditions namely  
RA, OA, ankylosing spondylitis  and gout.  Heart disease in the study could be under 
reported as the option s given in the questionnaire w ere not clear. The Cairncross  et 
al. value was derived by adding the prevalence of  CAD, CMY, ischaemic heart disease 
and dysrhythmias (excluding HTN). MBD  for th is study included BMD , schizophrenia, 
depression  and anxiety conditions . Cairncross et al. only included BPD and 
schizophrenia.  MBD prevalence was higher in the study.  Chronic disease prevalence 
for the study was higher than the medical aid prevalence’s fo r the conditions AST 
(ages 25+) and BMD.39 
The prevalence of chronic disease in participants 50 years and older in this study 
compared with the Westaway study shows lower prevalence of chronic diseases for 
arthritis, DM and HTN .128

 Chronic disease prevalence compared to other athle tic populations  
To compare this study results with other studies on masters athletes, pre -masters (18

 Relationship between age and chronic disease  
The chronic di sease prevalence per age group is shown in Figure 6.  
 
Figure 6: Chronic disease prevalence per age group  
There was a significant weak positive relationship r=0.24, (p<0.001) between chronic 
disease and increased age in the masters swimmers . There was also a significant 
weak positive relationship between age and number of  chronic diseases  r=0.26, 
(p<0.001). This finding is similar to a review by  Marengoni et al . on multi -morbidity  that 
found older age  and female gender were factors associated with multiple chronic 
conditions .129  
Relationship between other parameters and chronic disease  
Comparing swimmers that w ere diagnosed with chronic disease and those without , 
the independent samples  T-test for equality of means showed no significant difference 
between swimmers training and competing with different motivations.  
No correlation was found between  chronic disease and the number of years 
swimming , volume -load or the distance per session . This finding shows that adult

89 
 swimmers with chronic disease train with the same volume -load as their healthy 
counterparts. This is d ifferent from the finding in a study by  McPhillips et al . that found 
that 1140 older adults between the ages of 50 and 93 wi th a history of chronic disease 
exercised less frequently than their healthy counterparts.50  
Medication use d for the treatment of chronic disease  
In order to compare the study results to the literature, only the chronic medication use 
for participants 25 years and older were analysed . The percentage  of particip ants that 
used prescribed chronic disease medication to treat their disease (33.3%, 95% CI 
(28.4, 38.3)) was higher than the 25.3% reported by masters athletes competing in the 
2017 Sydney WMG and the 2018 Pan Pacific masters championships and that of the 
runners (14.8%) competing in the 2012 Two Oceans Marathon  in South Africa.   
The most prevalent medication prescribed was HTN medication (13. 7%), 
Hypolipidemic medication (1 1.1%), CVD medication (4. 3%) and Bronchodilators 
(3.7%). The most treated chronic conditions were HTN, HLD and AST.

 Most prescribed medication s to treat  chronic disease  
The most prescribed chronic medication s to treat the types of chronic disease as 
selected by the participants are summari sed in Table 2 7.

In line with the higher prevalence of HTN, HL D and CVD in the study population , they 
were also prescribed more HTN and hypolipidemic medication as well as cardiac 
medication when compared to masters athletes and swimmers in other studies. The 
use of bronchodilators were similar in all the studie s.9, 127

 Possible doping infringements through the use of  chronic medication  
To compare with previous research d oping infringements through the use of 
prescribed chronic medication in participants 25 -years and older are shown in Table 
28. For this sub -population  33.3%, 95% CI ( 28.3, 38.4) used chronic medication  of 
which 1 0.8% is on the prohibited  list. This is lower than the prevalence found in 
Campian et al . (19.8%)  and slightly higher  than that by Chalmers et al  (10.1%) .10, 26 
The most used  chronic  medication that were on the prohibited list were diuretics used 
to treat HTN (7.7%), beta -antagonists to treat AST (1. 1%) and metabolic and hormone 
modulators (1.1%) used to treat various chronic diseases.  
Five swimmers used PEDs  to treat AST that contained beta -2-antagonists. One 
swimmer used a beta -blocker to treat a heart condition . As beta -blockers are only 
prohibited for specific sports that do not include s wimming it was not considered as an 
infringement. Four swimmers used metabolic and hormone modulators to treat DM. 
The most used PEDs  were diuretics and masking agents mainly used to down regulate 
HTN.

and athletes, pre-masters (18  - 24) were excluded from the statistics. Table 29 
compares the results for injury suffered in the last five years due to swimming in the  
sample  to other athletic populations.

The Walsh et al . study analysed statistics collected from  all 28 sporting codes in the 
WMG. As previous research has proven that injuries and specifically injury locations 
are sport specific, no injury comparisons between the WMG study and this study can 
be made .55, 56, 130 Injuries to the shoulder in the participants  (18.1%)  was much lower 
than previous prevalence  reports on masters swimmers.54, 62, 65 This might be due to 
the two-year COVID -19 lockdown restrictions on facilities and events that limited 
training and competitions in South Africa. Knee injury prevalence  in the study (1.7%) 
was lower than that reported by Atilla et al . in male masters sw immers (10.2%).54

 Relationship s between motivation , volume -load and prevalence of injury  
Comparing the participants with a motivation to win and those that chose other 
motivations such as health and enjoyment using an independent samples T -test for 
equality of means , there was no significant difference  (p=0.25)  between those that 
reported an i njury (m=0.25, SD=0.4) and those without (m=0.33, SD=0.5). 
A negligible  correlation  (r=0.1, p=0.048) was found between volume -load and injury. 
This finding is similar to findings by Atilla et al .62 and Barry et al .65 that concluded that 
correlation between the parameters was insigni ficant and unclear . A negligible 
correlation was found between any specific injury location and volume -load.  
Relationship  between age and prevalence of injur y 
The Pearson ’s correlation showed that there was a negligible  correlation (r=-0.15, 
p<0.005)  between age and injury prevalence . Similar to the result in this study , 
Heazelwood et al. found no significant correlation between injury incidence and age in 
football players in preparation for the WMG.60 Most studies that investigated the 
relationship between age and injury prevalence compared masters athletes and their 
younger co unterparts or age and injury prevalence during a specific event.57, 61, 62  This 
made comparisons to previous findings in the literature difficult.   
Relationship between cross -training and injury prevalence and location  
Using T -test for equality of means , injury prevalence for swimmers that competed in 
triathlon  (m=0.21, SD=0.4) and regularly cross -trained by cycling and running were 
compared to swimmers that only indicated competition in pool events  (m=0.28, 
SD=0.5). This test showed no significant difference  (p=0.19)  between the injury 
prevalence or injury location for pool swimmers and triathletes.

 Prescribed and OTC medication used shortly before and during  
competitions  
Analysis of the prescribed and OTC  medication for participants 25 -years and older 
showed that 1 6.4% of the swimmers took medication to treat injury or illness shortly 
before or during competitions. The most used medication were NSAIDs (13. 1%) 
analgesics (2. 6%) and cortisone (2.5%).  The prevalence of analgesic use is lower than 
that reported by Seifarth et al.79 and Dietz et al.82 for competitive (9.2%) and 
recreational triathletes (11.1%).  The use of NSAIDs was higher than that reported by 
Walsh et al . for masters athletes (6.4%) in the WMG. Combined analgesic and NSAIDs 
used by the swimmers ( 17.4%) was lower than t hat reported by Locquet et al . for 
female runners (34.6%).74 The comparisons of the medication used with other 
literature studies done on athletes shortly before or during competition is shown in

 Possible doping infringements through use of pre and in competition 
medication  
Analysis of the medication that constitute possible doping infringements shows that 
one participant used an AST pump and nine swimmers used cortisone shortly before 
or during competition. The 10 swimmers that committed possible doping infringement 
were 2.8% of  the participants . This doping prevalence for the masters swimmers is 
lower than the estimated 24 -hour estimated doping prevalence reported in female 
runners (8.1%)  and ultramarathon runners (8.4%) during competition or training.68, 74 
Attitude s towards doping  
The expressed attitude of the swimmers on the PEAS 8 -item version showed scores 
considerably lower than the 3.5 -midpoint score per question. The total score for males 
(12.49  ± 5.1, p<0.001) and females ( 11.53  ± 4.5, p<0.001) as well as the  combined 
score ( 11.99  ± 4.8, p<0.001) is also lower than the 28 -midpoint score for the 
instrument. This showed that masters swimmers do not have a positive or lenient 
attitude toward doping.  
Although male swimmers showed a slightly more lenient but negat ive doping attitude 
when compared to female swimmers, the difference between the genders was not 
significant (p=0.064). The three questions that scored closer to the midpoint was 
question three  (The risks related to doping are exaggerated, m=1.8), question five 
(Doping is an unavoidable part of the competitive sport, m=1. 9) and question eight  
(There is no difference between drugs  and speedy swimsuits that are all used to 
enhance performance, m=1.6 ).  
Using an independent samples T -test to compare the two gender sub -sets for 
questions three , five and eight  showed the following differences. For question three  
(p=0.291) females scored higher than the male swimmers possibly showing according 
to the cat egories assigned to the questions by Folkers et al ., that females have a 
slightly better knowledge about doping as well as the health risks involved. Males 
scored higher than female swimmers on questions five (p=0.057) and eight  (p<0.001) 
possibl y showing  that they believe that hypocrisy exist re garding  doping and 
swimsuits.117

 Comparing the study results with the Vargo et al . study on university student athletes 
(mean age 24 ± 5.98 years), shows that the masters swimmers (mean age 51.27 + 
1.5 years) have a lower average mean PEAS score ( 11.99 ±4.8) than the student 
athletes (18.473 ± 8.612). In the Vargo et al. study , females scored significantly lower 
(14.242 ± 3.307) than males (21.088 ± 9.869).84 
Attitude differences between competitive and non -competitive 
motivations  
An independent sample T -test between swimmers with a comp etitive motivation 
(m=12.02) and swimmers with non -competitive motivations (m=11.99) showed no 
significant difference (p=0.962) in the mean scores for the PEAS instrument. This 
shows no significant difference in the attitude towards doping  between swimmers 
motivated to win and swimmers training and competing with a health o r fun and 
enjoyment motivation.  
Swimmers ’ attitude towards fellow competitors doping  
It was hypothesi sed that the attitude of masters swimmers towards doping will differ 
between two possible doping scenarios namely: (1) the attitude towards competitors 
taking PEDs with the sole purpose of improving performance  and (2) the attitude 
towards prescribed medication use by competitors to treat chronic disease that can 
lead to un fair advantage in competition.  
The PEAS 8 -item instrument in the section above was used to test the attitude of 
swimmers for scenario 1 (intentional doping to increase performance). The specific 
questions below were set to test the swimmers ’ attitude towa rds medication use. The 
specific questions relating to the masters swimmers ’ attitude towards fellow 
competitors using medication vs intentional doping are analysed below.  
Question 1: Swimmers taking medication to treat chronic disease, illness or injury h ave 
an unfair advantage in competitions. The below the midpoint score ± SD for this 
question ( m=2.18 ± 1.1) indicated that swimmers do not believe that taking medication 
to treat chronic disease should be construed as doping.

97 
 Question 2: I do not care if my competitors take medication even if it gives them an 
unfair advantage in competitions. A n above the midp oint score ± SD in this question 
would indicate that swimmers are not lenient to intentional doping. The score of 
m=2.85 ± 1.4 indicates that masters swimmers are ambivalent towards the use of 
medicine even if it gives an unfair advantage in competition.  
Question 3: I do not care if my competitors INTENTIONALLY use prohibited 
substances other than chronic medication or methods to give them an unfair 
advantage in competitions. The below midpoint  score  ± SD in this question (m=1.52  ± 
1.1) indicates that swimm ers are not lenient towards intentional doping. This reiterates 
the results of the PEAS score in scenario 1.  
Question 4: Intentionally taking performance enhancing drugs with the sole purpose 
of improving performance has long term health implications. Participants  strongly 
agreed with this statement (m=4.29  ± 1.3). This again underscores the negative 
attitude of masters swimmers towards intentional doping.  
Question 5: The use of chronic medication helps masters swimmers to perform as 
healthy individuals. Participants  strongly agreed with this statement (m=3.45 ± 1.3).  
In summary the five questions on participants attitude towards fellow competitors’ use 
of PEDs showed that masters swimmers are lenient towards the use of chronic 
medication used to treat disease but non -lenient towards intentional doping.  
Intentional doping  
Only one male swimmer indicated to that he had used a  banned substance. No 
swimmers ind icated that they were currently using PEDs. It is possible that even 
though the question design reassured participants that the survey was anonymous, 
participants might have been hesitant to reveal the truth about their doping. Elbe and 
Barkoukis describes  doping as ‘ a behaviour that may have significant legal and health 
consequences for the user and individuals asked about doping might intentionally 
deny their involvement.’85

 Discussion summary  
Comparisons with population data in the USA and Australia as well as South African 
medical aid data shows that South African masters swimmers have a lower  prevalence 
of specific chronic diseases when compared to general population statistics found in 
the literature.9, 44 The comparisons show higher HTN, HLD and DM prevalence’s for 
the South African masters swimmers compared to masters athletes and runners from 
other countries. A significant weak positive relationship r=0.24, (p<0.001) was found 
between chronic disea se and age and b etween age and number of chr onic diseases  
r=0.26, (p<0.001).  
The prescribed chronic disease medication use prevalence of 33.7% in the study is 
higher than the 25.3% reported by masters athletes and that of the runners (14.8%) , 
but t he use of bronchodilators were similar .9, 127 Further a nalysis of the chr onic 
medication used showed that 11.4% of the participants used medication that is on the 
prohibited  list. This is lower than the prevalence found in Campian et al.10 (19.8%)  and 
slightly higher than that by Chalmers et al . (10.1%) .26 
Injuries to the shoulder  (18.1%) and the knee  (1.7%) in the participants was much 
lower than previous prevalence report ed on masters swimmers.54, 62, 65 This might be 
due to the two -year COVID -19 lockdown restrictions on facilities and events that 
limited training and competitions in South Africa. Statistical analysis showed a 
negligible  correlation  between volume -load and injury. This finding is simila r to findings 
by Atilla et al.62 and Barry et al.65 that concluded that correlation between the 
parameters was insignificant and unclear . There was a significant (p<0.005) but weak 
negative correlation (r=-0.15) between age and injury prevalence. Similar to the result 
in this study, Heaz lewood et al. found  no significant correlation between injury 
incidence and age in football players in preparation for the WMG.60  
Analysis of the prescribed and OTC medication showed that 16.4% of the swimmers 
took medication to treat injury or illness shortly before or during competitions  with 2.8% 
of swimmers committing possible doping infringement s. This was mostly due to the 
use of cortisone shortly before or during competition. This doping prevalence for the 
masters swimmers is lower than the estimated 24 -hour estimated doping prevalen ce

 reported in female runners (8.1%) and ultramarathon runners (8.4%) during 
competition or training.68, 74 
The expr essed attitude of the swimmers on the PEAS 8 -item version showed that 
masters swimmers do not have a positive or lenient attitude toward doping. Although 
male swimmers showed a slightly more lenient but still negative attitude  towards 
doping when compared to female swimmers, the difference between the genders was 
not significant (p=0.064).  
Specific questions were set to test the swimmers ’ attitude towards fellow competitors  
use of PEDs . The findings showed that swimmers believed that swimmers taking 
medica tion to treat  disease  or injury to allow them to compete as healthy individuals 
did not have an unfair advantage in competitions  and that taking medication should 
not be construed as doping. The participants were  not lenient towards intentional 
doping. This reiterates the results of the PEAS score.  
In response to the direct doping questions, o nly one male swimmer indicated having 
used  a banned substance. No swimmers indicated that they were currently using 
PEDs.

 Chapter 6: Limitations, strengths, conclusion  and 
recommendations  
Limitations  of the study  
The definitions of heart disease and  CVD was not clearly defined  in the planning stage 
of the study . This made comparisons with other CVD prevalence research in th e 
general population and athletic populations difficult.  
In the reporting of medication use participants  could take multiple medication s and 
might have grown  tired of listing, resulting in incomplete answers.  
Due to the COVID -19 pandemic that limited tra ining and competition due to the 
lockdown in South Africa the original term of 24 months for injury reporting was 
extended to five years. This extended reporting period could have led to recall bias in 
the injury reporting.  
On the intentional doping questions, it was decided not to use the random response 
techniques . This could have resulted in participants  not answering truthfully as they 
mistrusted the anonymity of the survey.  Not using random response techniques in this 
question might have led to under reporting and is a limitation to this study.  
Strengths  of the study  
In setting the questionnaire care was taken to choose multiple  choice questions with 
a non -response option. A limited number of open -ended questions w ere worded 
carefully and w ere mostly used when a closed question answer was not selected. This 
ensured consistent reliability of answers between participants . To ensure  face, content 
and internal validity, questions and data elements was linked back to specific research 
objectives. No completion incentives were offered to limit sample bias. Due to the 
online collection and tabulation of data by Google forms, systematic d ata errors were 
prevented.  
The use of a pilot study and the feedback received from the participants  helped to 
clarify the survey questions and to improve question validity.

 Despite  the failure to distribute the survey to competitors on the aQuellé Midmar Mile 
database the response rate on the SAMS database and subsequent snowball 
distribution led to a sample that included  both competitive and recreational masters 
swimmers. Results showed a mix of swimmers that competed in combined events 
such as triathlon , pool and open water events.  
In the initial planning it was estimated that the survey would result in a 4% response 
rate (max imum  450 participants ) in line with similar previous research.10 The survey 
resulted in an actual number of 359 responses. Even though the response rate cannot 
be determined due to the snowball sampling the resulted response was enough to 
result in several significant findings.  
Analysis of the gender  responses  showed 48.7% male and 50.7% female swimmers  
completed the survey . 
This is the first study to the researchers knowledge, conducted on master s swimmers 
in South Africa relating to health status, medication use and doping. This study will 
add to th e limited amount of research that has been done on this study population.

 Conclusion s 
The analysis of the study data showed a balanced  demographic profile of South 
African masters swimmers  with almost equal participation of male (48.7%) and female 
(50.7%) swimmers. The study population showed a representative sample of masters 
swimmers  competing at different levels and at a variety of events , thereby  thus fully 
achiev ing the first objective  of this study.  
As o ne of the common causes of chronic disease is inactivity  and studies have 
concluded that participation in physical activity and sport reduces the risk factors that 
lead to disease development and as such lowers the prevalence of chronic  disease.6, 
9, 41 Although comparisons with the general population proved difficult due to  different 
definitions and grouping of chronic diseases a nd the differences in study parameters 
such as age categories, the prevalence of chronic disease in this sample  of masters 
swimmers was lower than that of the general population . Comparison of the  data to 
other athletic populations showed  higher HTN, HLD a nd DM prevalence’s for the 
South African masters swimmers.  
Injuries reported in the five years preceding the survey were lower than that reported 
in previous studies on masters swimmers and might be due to the two -year COVID -
19 lockdown restrictions on facilities and events that limited training and competitions 
in South Africa. Injuries to the shoulder region followed by knee injuries were the most 
frequently reported injuries. Reporting on the health status of masters swimmers 
achieved the second and third objectives of the study.  
Analysis of the medication used to treat chronic disease and the prescribed and OTC 
medication to treat injury or illness shortly before or during competitions , showed 
respectively  that 11.4% and 2.8% of the swimmers took PEDs  and were possibly 
committing unintentional  doping infringement s. These findings achieved the fourth, 
fifth and sixth objectives of the study.  
Adults enter swimming events for a variety of reasons including health and fitness, 
social  and more competitive motiv ations.27-30 The increased focus on health and 
fitness and the benefits of exercise in prolonging life has led to the well -known masters

103 
 catchphrase  of “The last one alive wins .” With this dominant motivation, the intentional 
use of PEDs may not be a problem in masters competitions and in this study only one 
swimmer indicated previous use of PEDs. Answers to this section on li fe-long and 
current intentional doping practices might have been underreported due to the direct 
questioning that was used . Due to this objective seven was only partially achieved.  
Using the PEAS 8 -item instrument to report on the attitude towards doping s howed 
that masters swimmers are not lenient toward intentional doping. However , specific 
questions set to test the swimmers ’ attitude towards chronic medication use, indicated 
that they believed that chronic medication helped masters swimmers to perform as  
healthy individuals and that this medication use should not be construed as doping. 
These findings achieved the ninth and 10th objectives of the study. Objective eight 
namely establishing a relationship between attitude s towards doping and doping 
behaviou r could not be achieved due to the limited response to the intentional doping 
section.  
To eliminate the intentional dopers, it might be necessary to start drug testing in 
masters competitions to determine the true prevalence of doping in masters 
swimming.  Some of WADA’s IFs have implemented anti -doping policies and testing 
specifically for masters athletes. The International Weightlifting Federation and USA 
Masters Track and Field athletes are educated on TUE procedures. Testing on 
randomly selected athlete s within age groups also takes place at competitions.131, 132 
In the 2017  - 2018 season, SAIDS only tested 60 urine samples, 30 blood samples 
and conducted two erythropoietin blood doping  tests on South African elite swimmers. 
The results only showed one infringement for testosterone use.133 Due to the 
complexity of sifting out legal medication use as specified in TUEs  and will create an 
additional financial burden for developing countries like South Africa.134  
To make medication use ‘legal’ during competition, masters swimmers can apply for 
TUEs. Participants in this study showed limited knowledge of doping and TUEs. The 
testing and TUE application processes are wrought with complexities and might lead 
to masters  swimmers being prevented from competing in a sport that they love. This 
would be particularly negative if the swimmers are non -competitive and only compete 
for motivations such as health, social companionship  and fun. Many swimmers using

104 
 prescribed medication may be victimi sed just to identify the few that intentionally use 
PEDs to improve their performance.99 Counter to the limited doping knowledge 
displayed by the swimmers 70.2% indicated that they were aware of the 
consequences of doping. These findings achieved the 11th and 12th objectives of the 
study.  
The doping dilemma of many masters athletes cannot be better expressed than in the 
exact words of Jeff Hammond a 58 -year-old USA cy clist: ‘‘They’re treating us like 20-
year-old Olympians. Something that is considered a performance -enhancing drug for 
an 18 -year-old may be a necessary life -saving medication for a senior athlete. I think 
it’s very unfair.’’ He was diagnosed with hypogona dism and takes supplemental 
testosterone to raise his levels to average for his age, as well as medication to combat 
low bone density. His functional deficiency does not meet the WADA criteria for 
application for a TUE and he was banned from competing in U SA sanctioned bike 
races until he received his TUE exemption from the U.S. Anti -Doping Agency after a 
long fight in 2016.135

 Recommendations  
Chronic disease usually requires medical treatment and may limit activities of daily 
living and athletic performance. FINA must be aware of the increased incidence of 
chronic disease with increased age and the associated risk in competiti on for older 
athletes as they state in their general rules for masters competitions: “Masters 
competitors must be aware of the need of being well prepared and medically fit before 
entering into masters competitions .” Even though this statement clearly indi cates 
some form of medical screening, no pre -participation health screening guidelines are 
provided for masters swimmers.32 As 39.1% of swimmers in this study have been 
diagnosed with chronic dise ase and used chronic medication , they should  get medical 
clearance before competing and they should be educated on the risks of taking chronic 
medication while exercising and competing.11, 136 This substantiates the need for 
further studies to set parameters for pre -screening of swimmers before taking up 
training and entering competiti ons.  
In line with the aim of the South African government to motivate adults to stay active 
for life, masters swimmers with chronic disease, using chronic medication that are 
prohibited, should be allowed to train for and participate in swimming events. C urrently 
no testing is done on masters swimmers in South Africa. Due to the complexity of 
testing and the high cost involved in weaning out medications and applying for TUEs, 
it is recommended that the status quo be maintained.  
Masters swimmers in this st udy displayed limited knowledge about the doping 
implications of medication use. They also did not enquire about the legality of 
prescribed medication use  for athletes from their health care providers.  The high 
prevalence of chronic disease and the associated medication use in this study, 
combined with the limited knowledge about doping, indicate that information 
campaigns about doping and medication use could be beneficial to the masters 
swimmers  and f or medical professionals that prescribe and issue medication to them.

 Appen dix B: Checklist for Reporting Results of Internet E -Surveys  
Checklist Item  Explanation  Page 
Number  
Describe survey 
design  Describe target population, sample frame. Is the sample a 
convenience sample? (In “open” surveys this is most likely.)  p13 
IRB approval  Mention whether the study has been approved by an IRB.  p20-21 
Informed consent  Describe the informed consent process. Where were the participants 
told the length of time of the survey, which data were stored and 
where and for how long, who the investigator was  and the purpose 
of the study?  p16, Ann 
C and E  
Data protection  If any personal information was collected or stored, describe what 
mechanisms were used to protect unauthorized access.  p21 
Development and 
testing  State how the survey was developed, including whether the usability 
and technical functionality of the electronic questionnaire had been 
tested before fielding the questionnaire.  p15-17 
Open survey 
versus closed 
survey  An “open survey” is a survey open for each visitor of a site, while a 
closed survey is only open to a sample which the investigator knows 
(password -protected survey).  Closed  
Contact mode  Indicate whether the initial contact with the potential participants was 
made  on the Internet. (Investigators may also send out 
questionnaires by mail and allow for Web -based data entry.)  Through 
registere
d bodies 
SAMS  
Advertising the 
survey  How/where was the survey announced or advertised? Some 
examples are offline media (newspap ers), or online (mailing lists – If 
yes, which ones?) or banner ads (Where were these banner ads 
posted and what did they look like?). It is important to know the 
wording of the announcement as it will heavily influence who 
chooses to participate. Ideally the survey announcement should be 
published as an appendix.  Mailing 
list, App 
E, p18  
Web/E -mail State the type of e -survey (e.g., one posted on a Web site, or one 
sent out through e -mail). If it is an e -mail survey, were the responses 
entered manually into a database, or was there an automatic method 
for capturing responses?  Email, 
p15, p18  
Context  Describe the Web site (for mailing list/newsgroup) in which the 
survey was posted. What is the Web site about, who is visiting it, 
what are visitor s normally looking for? Discuss to what degree the 
content of the Web site could pre -select the sample or influence the 
results. For example, a survey about vaccination on an anti -
immunization Web site will have different results from a Web survey 
conducte d on a government Web site  N/A 
Mandatory/volunt
ary Was it a mandatory survey to be filled in by every visitor who wanted 
to enter the Web site, or was it a voluntary survey?  Voluntar
y, p21  
Incentives  Were any incentives offered (e.g., monetary, prizes, or non -
monetary incentives such as an offer to provide the survey results)?  None, 
p32 
Time/Date  In what timeframe was the data collected?  P18, p22  
Randomization of 
items or 
questionnaires  To prevent biases items can be randomized or alternated.  Done in 
Google 
forms  
 
 
 
 
©©  UUnniivveerrssiittyy  ooff  PPrreettoorriiaa   
121 
 Adaptive 
questioning  Use adaptive questioning (certain items, or only conditionally 
displayed based on responses to other items) to reduce number and 
complexity of the questions.  Done  
Number of Items  What was the number of questionnaire items per page? The number 
of items is an important factor for the completion rate.  Ave 
2/section
. Max 5  
Number of 
screens (pages)  Over how many pages was the questionnaire distributed? The 
number of items is an important factor for the completion rate.  16 
sections 
/screens  
Completeness 
check  It is technically possible to do consistency or completeness checks 
before the questionnaire is submitted. Was this done  and if “yes”, 
how (usually JavaScript)? An alternative is to check for 
comple teness after the questionnaire has been submitted (and 
highlight mandatory items). If this has been done, it should be 
reported. All items should provide a non -response option such as 
“not applicable” or “rather not say”  and selection of one response 
optio n should be enforced.  In data  
 Cleanup  
Included  
Done  
Review step  State whether participants  were able to review and change their 
answers (e.g., through a Back button or a Review step which 
displays a summary of the responses and asks the participants  if 
they are correct).  No 
Unique site visitor  If you provide view rates or participation rates, you need to define 
how you determined a unique visitor. There are different techniques 
available, based on IP addresses or cookies or both.  No done 
to protect 
anonymit
y 
View rate (Ratio 
of unique survey 
visitors/unique 
site visitors)  Requires counting uni que visitors to the first page of the survey, 
divided by the number of unique site visitors (not page views!). It is 
not unusual to have view rates of less than 0.1 % if the survey is 
voluntary.  No done 
to protect 
anonymit
y 
Participation rate 
(Ratio of un ique 
visitors who 
agreed to 
participate/unique 
first survey page 
visitors)  Count the unique number of people who filled in the first survey page 
(or agreed to participate, for example by checking a checkbox), 
divided by visitors who visit the first page of  the survey (or the 
informed consents page, if present). This can also be called 
“recruitment” rate.  Part of 
stats 
analysis  
Completion rate 
(Ratio of users 
who finished the 
survey/users who 
agreed to 
participate)  The number of people submitting the last questionnaire page, 
divided by the number of people who agreed to participate (or 
submitted the first survey page). This is only relevant if there is a 
separate “informed consent” page or if the survey goes over several 
pages. This is a measure for at trition. Note that “completion” can 
involve leaving questionnaire items blank. This is not a measure for 
how completely questionnaires were filled in. (If you need a measure 
for this, use the word “completeness rate”.)  Part of 
stats 
analysis  
Cookies used  Indicate whether cookies were used to assign a unique user identifier 
to each client computer. If so, mention the page on which the cookie 
was set and read  and how long the cookie was valid. Were duplicate 
entries avoided by preventing users access to the survey twice; or 
were duplicate database entries having the same user ID eliminated 
before analysis? In the latter case, which entries were kept for 
analysis (e.g., the first entry or the most recent)?  Cookies 
will be 
disabled

122 
  
IP check  
  
  
  
   Indicate whether the IP address of the client computer was used to 
identify potential duplicate entries from the same user. If so, mention 
the period for which no two entries from the same IP address were 
allowed (e.g., 24 hours). Were duplicate entries av oided by 
preventing users with the same IP address access to the survey 
twice; or were duplicate database entries having the same IP 
address within a given period eliminated before analysis? If the 
latter, which entries were kept for analysis (e.g., the fi rst entry or the 
most recent)?  No IP 
addresse
s will be 
used or 
collected  
Log file analysis  Indicate whether other techniques to analyze the log file for 
identification of multiple entries were used. If so, please describe.  No 
Registration  In “closed” (non -open) surveys, users need to login first and it is 
easier to prevent duplicate entries from the same user. Describe how 
this was done. For example, was the survey never displayed a 
second time once the user had filled it in, or was the userna me 
stored together with the survey results and later eliminated? If the 
latter, which entries were kept for analysis (e.g., the first entry or the 
most recent)?  This 
survey 
will be 
closed  
Handling of 
incomplete 
questionnaires  Were only completed questionnaires analyzed? Were 
questionnaires which terminated early (where, for example, users 
did not go through all questionnaire pages) also analyzed?  The 
statisticia
n will 
analyze 
this data  
Questionnaires 
submitted with an 
atypical 
timestamp  Some inve stigators may measure the time people needed to fill in a 
questionnaire and exclude questionnaires that were submitted too 
soon. Specify the timeframe that was used as a cut -off point and 
describe how this point was determined.  No 
timefram
e 
Statistical 
correction  Indicate whether any methods such as weighting of items or 
propensity scores have been used to adjust for the non -
representative sample; if so, please describe the methods.  Part of 
statistical 
analysis

 Appendix F: PEAS -8 item questionnaire  
PEAS items  
1. Legalizing performance enhancements would be beneficial for sport.  
2. Doping is necessary to be competitive.  
3. The risks related to doping are exaggerated.  
4. Athletes should not feel guilty about breaking the rules and taking performance -enhancing drugs.  
5. Doping is an unavoidable part of the competitive sport.  
6. Doping is not cheating since everyone does it  
7. Only the quality of performance should ma tter, not the way athletes achieve it.  
8. There is no difference between drugs, fiberglass poles and speedy swimsuits that are all used to enhance 
performance.
