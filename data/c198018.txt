Abstract. Over the past 23 years, 67 patients have been admitted with spinal cord 
injuries resulting from swimming and diving. These numbers comprise 10'5 per cent 
of all traumatic spinal cord injuries received, and 20·6 per cent of all cervical spine 
injuries received. Ninety-five per cent of these patients were male, and more than 
three-quarters were young males under the age of 30 years. Two-thirds ofthese patients 
had permanent residual disability with an early mortality rate of 4"4 per cent. 
Key words: Swimming and diving; fractured cervical spine; tetraplegia. 
AUSTRALIA is a large country with a land area of approximately that of the United 
States of America, and is situated in the southern hemisphere in a tropical or 
sub-tropical zone. The major cities, where most of the popUlation is centred, are 
situated on the coastline around Australia. The summers are long and hot for 
approximately six months of the year in the southern part of Australia, and all the 
year round in the rest of Australia. Swimming and diving are an everyday 
occurrence for most Australians. Australia is also a reasonably affluent society, 
and in my home city of Perth, there are many thousands of garden swimming-pools. 
During the hot summer months those situated inland without access to the coast, 
use farm dams and local rivers to cool off. 
Beaches near the major cities are patrolled by the Surf Lifesaving Association 
which are entirely voluntary, and give very good service in rescuing and resusci­
tating those in difficulties on the beaches. Quite apart from spinal cord injuries, 
figures from the New South Wales Surf Lifesaving Association show that in a 
period of 3 years from 1974 there were 96 cases of immersion resulting in 29 
deaths from drowning, with 67 survivors, the majority of the deaths being in the 
young Australian male. 
Survival of the patient with a cervical spinal cord injury can be attributed to 
a great degree to the activities of voluntary organisations such as this, in carrying 
out immediate resuscitation and, of course, better methods of resuscitation at the 
emergency centres when the patient is accepted for treatment. 
Of a total of 641 spinal cord injuries received at the Spinal Unit in Perth over 
the past 22 years, cervical injuries amounted to 336 (52 '4 per cent) of all spinal 
injuries (Table I).

IIO PARAPLEGIA 
Taking cervical injuries alone, motor vehicle accidents accounted for 185 
(55'4 per cent), and aquatic sports (swimming and diving) accounted for 67 (20'6 
per cent), Overall, swimming and diving alone accounted for 10'5 per cent of all 
spinal cord injuries received (Table II), 
This is an injury of the male rather than of the female, and in the series 
presented there were 64 males (95'5 per cent), and only 3 female (4'5 per cent). 
This may mean that girls are less aggressive, or have more care for their well-being, 
or are more interested in displaying themselves in the latest bikini without actually 
entering the water (Table III). 
The younger male is more frequently involved, and more than three-quarters 
were under the age of 30, and 91 per cent were under the age of 40. 
The level of injury involved was predominantly that at C4-5-6 level with 
some multi-level injuries presenting, producing a total of 79 fractures or dislocations 
in 67 patients.

Some patients had fractures or fracture-dislocation at more than one level. 
These figures are almost identical with those published by David Burke from 
Melbourne (1978). He quotes diving injuries as producing II per cent of his total 
spinal injuries, 95 per cent of these being male, with a mean age of 27 years at 
presentation. 
Illustrative Case Histories 
Case No. I. J. G. (age I7): A surfing injury on the beach, 'dumped' by a large wave 
on to his head. Sustained compression fracture of the seventh cervical vertebra with 
transient paralysis of all four limbs with rapid recovery. CA.T. scan measured 10 mm 
at the disc space between C6 and 7 and 10·5 mm behind the seventh cervical vertebral 
body. Just below minimal acceptable normal diameters. This boy proceeded to full 
recovery and persisted in surfing, and has been re-admitted on one occasion subsequently 
with acute hyperaesthesia of both upper limbs. 
Case NO. 2. D. S. (age I9): Diving into a shallow, rocky pool at a Jazz Concert where a 
considerable amount of alcohol was taken previously. Transient loss of all power in all 
four limbs, but when seen 2 hours later at the Emergency Centre, had resolved to a 
Brown-Sequard syndrome with motor loss in left upper and lower limbs. Proceeded to 
recovery but still has sensory disturbance and weakness in left upper limb as residual 
disability. 
This is a hyperextension injury with contusion over the forehead on presentation, 
and fractures of the neural arches of the second and third cervical vertebrae. CA.T. 
scan demonstrates a fracture of the neural arch and not spinous process fractures alone 
as suggested on the plain lateral X-rays. 
Case NO. 3. P. R. (age 24): Also diving into the same rocky pool as Case 2 a"ove. 
Both patients admitted within half-an-hour of each other, after consuming alcohol and, 
in addition, marihuana. A complete tetraplegia at C6 level on admission and has 
improved since to be C7 motor level with TI sensory level. Plain X-ray shows a mild 
compression fracture of the seventh cervical vertebra. However, tomographs show a 
severe fracture of the body of the sixth and seventh cervical vertebrae, and CA.T. scan

Case NO. 4. R. S. (Age 41): Body surfing on a beach some 200 miles south of Perth 
and 'dumped' by a large wave. Had chest complications from inhalation of sea water

and required tracheostomy. At first was tetraplegic at C4 level and has now resolved

retropulsion of the body of the fifth cervical vertebra with forward dislocation of C4 
upon C5.

River and consuming Ouzo at the rate of half a tumbler every 10 minutes. The boat 
grounded on a sandbar and in his confused state he did not appreciate that this implied

shallow water, and dived in to push his boat off. He had severe fractures of the fourth 
and fifth cervical vertebrae with retropulsion of the bodies of C4 upon Cs and Cs upon 
C6. He was tetraplegic initially at C4, requiring tracheostomy and assisted respiration 
and has remained static at the fourth cervical level, both sensory and motor. 
Of the 67 cervical injuries, 50 per cent had complete tetraplegia, and a further I I 
had incomplete tetraplegia, giving a total of 66 per cent with a major disability. 
The mortality rate was 4'4 per cent in the first 12 months, mainly with respiratory 
problems in the few elderly people in this series. A further 4 cases succumbed, giving 
an overall mortality rate over 22 years of 10'5 per cent. 
SUMMARY 
Fracture of the cervical spine from swimming or diving is primarily an injury 
of the young, active male, two-thirds of whom remain with a major disability. 
Life expectancy of the majority of this group is in excess of 30 years with present 
management in developed countries. This implies a high cost to the state in terms 
of supportive finance and manpower. In Australia, swimming and diving injuries 
account for 10'5 per cent of all cord injuries received. 
RESUME 
La fracture cervicale de l'epine dorsale provenant de la nage ou du plongeon est 
principalement attribuee aux jeunes hommes actifs dont les deux tiers restent avec une grave 
infirmite. La duree de l'existence dans la majorite de ce groupe est au des sus de trente ans 
grace aux soins re<;:us dans les pays developes. Cela implique a l'etat de la main d'oeuvre et 
des finances importantes. Les accidents dus it la nage et au plongeon en Australie comptent 
pour 10.5 % de tous les accidents it l'epine dorsale.
