Abstract
Agroupof453eliteyoungathletes(231boys,
222girls)infivetwoyearagegroupsfrom
8-16yearsofagewasfollowed upfortwo
yearsinordertoidentifyselfreported injuries
overthatperiod.Foursportswerestudied,
namelyfootball(soccer), gymnastics, tennis,
andswimming. Theinjuryratewaslowwith
justoverhalfthechildren suffering oneor
moreinjuriesperyear,withthemajority of
thoseinjuredsustaining oneinjuryonly.Over
thetwoyearperiodofintensive sporting
activitythisamounted tolessthanoneinjury
per1000hoursoftraining. Thehighestriskof
injurieswasinfootball(67%)andthelowestin
swimming (37%).Mostinjuries (70%)were
acuteandofaminornature,although overuse
injuriesdidrequirelongerperiodsofftraining
andcompetition thanacuteinjuries(20v13
days).Footbaliers appeared tosustainmore
significant injuriesthanothersportsasjudged
bythetimerequired toresumetrainingand/or
competition (16daysafteracuteand57after
overuse). Nosignificant associations were
foundbetween injuryrate,injuryseverity,
sex,andpubertal statuswiththesingleexcep-
tionoffemale gymnasts inwhommore
injuries occurred inthelatterstagesof
puberty. Onlyfourofthe453athletes
reported injuryasareasonforretiringfrom
theirchosen sports.Mostinjuries inelite
youngathletes areminor,theirprevalence is
lowand,atleastintheshorttomedium term,
donotconstitute asignificiant health
problem.

Discussion
Attheoutsetofthestudyitwasthoughtthata
largenumber ofoveruse injuries wouldbe
foundinthispopulation. However theresults
clearlyshowed thatmost wereduetoacute
traumaratherthanoveruse andthatannual
injuryprevalence waslow.Ourfindings agree
closelywiththoseofarecentreview that
concluded thatchildandyouthsports aresafe
andthatmostinjuries areminorandself
limiting2 (ouroverallincidence ofsportsrelated
injuryof40forevery100athletes being
remarkably similar tothe39injuries per100
athletes foundinaprevious report'5). Mostof
theinjuries sustained wereofaminor nature
and,while noconfirmatory dataexist,would
probably notexceedtheratesofinjuryexpected
infreeplayactivities inthegeneralpopulation.
Itwasalsoofinterest thatoverhalfofthe
injuriesreported, outsidetraining orcompeti-
tion,wereduetosomeothersporting activity.
Although wedidnotinquireexactly wheretheseinjuriesoccurred, itwaslikelythatmany
ofthemwererelatedtoschoolsports.Concerns
aboutschoolsportshavebeenraisedinthepast
including poorqualityplayingfields,inappro-
priateprotective equipment, andinefficient
supervision bywellmeaning butuntrained
peoplewithlimitedknowledge ofsportsphysio-
logyandthetreatment ofsportsinjuries.' 2It
hasbeensuggested thatqualityaswellasthe
amountoftrainingmayinfluence injuryrates,2anassertion thatthepresent studywould
support. Contrary towidelyheldopinion, elite
youngathletesundergoing intensive trainingdo
notappeartobeatincreased riskofinjury.On
thecontrary, ourdatasuggesta'protective'
effectofhighlevelorganised sporting activity.
Asmallnumberofhighachieving individuals,
oftenwellpublicised, willsufferasaconse-
quenceoftheirsport.Continual improvement
incoaching methods andsportsequipment
shouldreducethesealready lowriskseven
further.
Although onlyasmallnumber ofoveruse
injurieswerefoundinoursample,parentsand
coachesshouldbeawarethatthistypeofinjury
couldbeprevented byreducing training
intensity. Itmustalsoberemembered by
coachesandparentsthattheyoungathletemay
beparticularly susceptible tooveruse injury
duringtheperiodofrapidgrowth.'6Theresultspresented hererequire some
qualification asthiswasarelatively shortterm
studyandfurtherresearchisrequired toestablish
whether therearethresholds oftrainingabove
whichthelikelihood ofinjuryisincreased. The
presentcohortshouldalsobeassessed againin
thefutureinordertoestablish theoccurrence of
furtheroveruseinjuriesandtoidentifyanylong
termsequelae.
