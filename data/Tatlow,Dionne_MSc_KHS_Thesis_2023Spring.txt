 Abstract  
Open water swimming (OWS) is currently one of the fastest growing mass participation 
sports worldwide, and  differs from pool swimming in that athletes  swim in natural 
bodie s of water such as lakes, oceans and rivers . Participation in this sport spans a wide 
range of individuals  of all ages with a roughly equal  sex distribution . No prior 
investigations have evaluated the musculoskeletal (MSK) injuries characteristic to the 
sport in a recreational capacity , and only one group has completed biannual surveillance 
in an elite population on three occasions . The purpose of the current study was to 
investigate the prevalence and explore possible risk factors associated with MSK injur ies 
in non -elite OW swimmers  during the COVID -19 pandemic  (for circumstantial reasons) . 
Participants were invited  through a variety of social media channels and OWS  
community communications to complete a self -administered internet -based survey to 
evaluate the details of any injuries sustained within the previous 6 -month period  and 
various other demographic and training related details . 156 participants completed or 
partially completed the survey (95 female , 52 male , 9 did not disclose their sex ; average  
age 47.7 (12.4) years).  The 6-month prevalence of MSK injury within this population 
was 30% (n=36), with the most commonly injured region being the shoulder  (n = 25) , 
and the second most common being  the cervical spine  (n = 6) . A logistic regression was 
performed to assess the association between self -reports of injury (outcome variable) and 
various predictor variables. The final model yielded one significant predictor variable: 
participation in efforts to prevent injury (OR [95%  CI] = 5.004 [1.356, 18.465], Wald = 
5.843, p = 0.016). Two marginally -significant predictor variables were age (OR [95%  
 
ii 
 CI] = 1.039 [0.996, 1.084], Wald = 3.093, p = 0.079) and sex (female) (OR [95%  CI] = 
2.614 [0.852, 8.021], Wald = 2.821, p = 0.093). Results of this study  will be di spersed 
among the OWS community via academic and open -access publications, and may be 
used to guide injury prevention and rehabilitation efforts  in this growing population.

 Chapter  1: Introduction  
The 2008 Beijing Olympics marked the introduction of  the 10km open water  
(OW)  swim into the  Olympic program ; this inclusion  both reflected  and further propelled  
open water swimming (OWS) events into one of the fastest growing mass participation 
sports  world -wide (Tipton & Bradford, 2014) . In contrast to traditional pool swimming 
events , OWS  takes place in natural bod ies of water  (e.g., lakes, oceans, rivers, etc.)  and 
events are based on water temperature ( e.g., ice swimming occurs in  water <5 °C), 
distance ( e.g., 10km is a marathon; >15km is  deemed  an ultr amarathon), and/or  event 
placement ( i.e., either stand -alone , within a triathlon or ‘swim -run’) (International Ice 
Swimming Association, 2019 ; FINA, 2019 : FINA, 2017 ). OW swimm ing requires 
athletes to perform repetitive sport -specific movements  of the upper and lower limb s to 
propel the swimmer forward in the water , while both stabilizing the core and rotating 
various spinal segments. This has the potential to place the OW athle te at an increased 
risk of injury. Despite the popularity  of the sport,  there have  been minimal investigations 
related to  the risk of injury within this growing population. Therefore, investigation of 
injury type, prevalence  and possible risk factors in  adult recreational OW swimmers is 
required  to guide the development of  sport -specific prevention strategies.   
The rules and regulations of marathon OWS are quite diverse ; FINA, the  
International Swimming Federation, gover ns international competitive programm ing 
whereas  local associations tied to a body of water typically  govern geographically 
adjacent  swims . For instance, the Channel Swimming Association (CSA) is a governing 
body regulating swimmers attempting to swim  the English Channel.  In countries  where 
long-distance OWS  is less popular , swimmers may opt to complete swims according to 
 
2 
 rules and regulations set out by the Marathon Swimmers Federation (MSF) and hire a 
third -party observer to ratify their swim  (Marathon Swimmers Federation , 2020) . The 
majorit y of OWS  associations  have rules congruent with those of the MSF and they also  
seem to  share a large cohort of administrative members. Therefore, the MSF tends to act 
as an overarching regulatory body for those swimmers completing swims outside of  
FINA -regulated and mass -participation , community -based  (unaffiliated ) events.  
FINA governs competitive OWS events , which  includ e the world championships , 
the Olympic Games, and various international competitions . However, the number of 
athletes participati ng in community -based  events  and MSF -sanctioned swims  
outnumbers  those competing  in the FINA circuit . The Global Swimming Series (GSS), 
founded by Canadian Rob Kent in 2014 is an OWS  series with the ultimate goal of 
developing the sport and connecting swimmers fr om around the world  (Global Swim 
Series, n.d.) . Prior to the COVID -19 pandemic, the  GSS included  over 100,000 
swimmers in 156 races  and 37 countries  competing in distances from 1  to 25 kilometers 
(Global Swim Series, n.d.) . These  races are generally commun ity-sanctioned with  very 
few being formally regulated  by either FINA or the MSF. Further, the GSS is not an 
exhaustive database of OW swims; there are many unaffiliated races and solo swims 
attempted outside of structured regulatory bodies . Thus, one may c onclude that 
participation in OWS  events is not limited to young competitive swimmers, but in fact 
may be dominated by  swimmers participating outside of FINA -sanctioned events . 
Because of the diverse nature of these events , it is difficult to tabulate an a ccurate 
representation of the population ; however, Bal dassarre et al . (2017) reported that the 
average age of athletes  who have successfully swam  the Catalina or English Channel (20 
 
3 
 and 21 miles, respectively) is roughly 40 years of age  and a roughly equal  split between 
male and female swimmers .  
Prior research into the health of OW swimmers has largely focused on medical 
concerns and physiological factors concerned with thermoregulation, body composition 
and environmental exposure s (Baldassarre et al ., 201 7). Musculoskeletal  (MSK)  injury 
prevalence and injury -prevention strategies  among the OW swimmer population have 
largely been either anecdotally generated or theoretically deduced from research 
conducted among  pool-swimmers  (Baldassarre  et al., 2017 ; Khod aee et al., 2016 ). There 
has been a small emergence of data collected among elite OW swimmers competing at 
the biennial FINA world championships, however, there appears to be no published 
reports on MSK injury prevalence in a non -elite OW swimming populati on (Mountjoy et 
al., 2016). Given that the distances swam in OW events are considerably greater than 
pool swimming events (the farthest pool swimming event is 1500m) and the OW 
swimmers’ dependence on capricious water conditions, an investigation into the MSK 
injuries characteristic to the sport is necessary to better guide injury prevention and 
rehabilitation efforts within this growing population of OW swimmers.   
    
1.1 Purpose  
The purpose of this survey study was to investigate the prevalence and explo re 
possible risk factors associated with MSK injuries in non-elite OW swimmers  during the 
COVID -19 pandemic . The reasoning for this timing was circumstantial given that this 
study was completed as part of a Master’s degree with a timeline that coincided wi th the 
pandemic . Descriptive statistics were  used to analyze injury prevalence , and regression 
 
4 
 analyses were used to assess the association between self-reports of injury and several 
self-reported training factors, event participation, and injury preventio n efforts.   
 
Chapter  2: Literature Review  
There  is currently n o peer-reviewed  published  literature that has investigated  
MSK injuries in a non-elite OWS  population . Thus, studies investigating injury 
prevalence and associated risk factors in similar popula tions were  used as a guid e. Most 
swimming research has been conducted in pool swimmer s; however, smaller and less 
rigorous explorations of injury epidemiology and risk factor analysis have been 
conducted in masters ’ pool swimmers, triathletes, elite OW swimmers, as well as the 
broad category of ‘aquatic athletes’  (Wolf et al., 2009; Baker et al. , 2019;  Feijen et al., 
2020; Johnston et al., 2019; Mountjoy et al., 201 6; Zwingenberger et al., 2014) . As such , 
these investigations  will be used for comparison with the OW swimming population  in 
this literature review .  
 
2.1 Sport Injury Prevention  
Sport -related injuries are significant, not only because of various factors relating 
to one’s physical and mental health ( e.g., decreased participation and enjoyment in 
sport), but the total injury burden also contributes to components of population health 
such as the costs associated with absenteeism from school and work, as well as 
healthcare costs associated with obesity and chronic disease management (Emery & 
Pasanen,  2019).  
 
 
5 
 2.1.1 Frameworks in Sport Injury Prevention  
In 1992, van Mechelen proposed a four -step model for injury prevention  that has 
since become the groundwork for many sport injury prevention programs (Emery & 
Pasanen, 2019).  The model  begins with deter mining  the extent of injury within a 
population  (step A), followed by  establishing the etiology and mechanisms associated 
(step B) (Emery & Pasanen, 2019). Once the injury mechanisms are understood , 
preventative measures and strategies can be introduced  (step C), and finally, their 
effectiveness can be evaluated by repeating the first step of the model (step D) (Figure 1) 
(van Mechelen et al., 1992; Emery & Pasanen, 2019) . Given the paucity of research 
concerning injuries in recreational OW swimmers, this s tudy focuses on the first two 
steps of the van Mechelen model . The primary  aim was to establish  the 6 -month 
prevalence of MSK injuries within this population, followed by an exploration into 
potential cause s, mechanism s and risk/preventative factors associ ated with such injuries .

2.1.2 Key Terminology in Sport Injury Prevention  
 Measuring injury in a population may be done several  different ways , with 
incidence and prevalenc e being the most commonly used. Incidence is defined as  the 
number of new injuries within a particular timeframe  in a defined population , while 
point -prevalence is the total number of injuries  at a given point in time; this  may include 
old injuries that be gan prior to the assigned time period ( Kuhn et al., 1997 ). The 
timeframe for the current study is further discussed in Section 2.6.1 , with a 6-month 
prevalence being selected to remain consistent with recreational running related injuries 
(Yamato et al., 2 019).  
 In the second step of the model proposed by van Mechelen and colleagues, 
researchers aim to identify risk factors and etiology  associated with each injury . Risk 
factors are the descriptors  that relate to the reasons  an athlete may be at risk for in jury in A. Establishing

7 
 a given situation , and injury  mechanisms are how the injury happens (Bahr & Holme, 
2003). There are two broad groups of risk factors: intrinsic and extrinsic (Bahr & Holme, 
2003).  Intrinsic (internal) risk factors relate to the athlete while extrinsic (external) risk 
factors relate to the environmental (Bahr & Holme, 2003). Each factor can also be 
further described as modifiable or non -modifiable, depending on whether it can be 
changed (Bahr & Holme, 2003). For example, age is non -modifiable wherea s training 
mileage is modifiable. It is important to note that risk factors may be related to injury but 
are not necessarily related to causation (Meeuwisse, 1994). Risk factors, mechanisms, 
and the complex interaction between them must be explored in orde r to establish a 
complete understanding of the injury (Bahr & Holme, 2003).  
 
2.2 Prevalence  & Risk Factors  by Anatomic Location  in Swimmers  
 
2.2.1 Shoulder  Injuries  
 
2.2.1.1 Prevalence  
In the 1970s , Hawkins and Kennedy coined the term  “swimmers’  shoulder”  due 
to the high prevalence of shoulder injury reported among the  swim team  at the 1972 
Olympic games  (Kennedy et al ., 1978) . This term was initially defined as anterior 
shoulder pain created by “impingement of the rotator cuff under the coracoacromial 
arch”; however, it has since been generalized to indicate any pain localized to the 
shoulder region without regard for the mechanism or anatomical structures involved 
(Struyf et al., 2017 p. 775). Shoulder injury has since been investigated in numerous pool 
 
8 
 swimming populations with reported  prevalence ranging from 20.8 to 91% (Sein et al ., 
2010; Wanivenhaus et al ., 2012; Tate et al ., 2012). Prien et al ., (2017) conducted a 
review of the injuries reported at the FINA aquatic world championships in 2009, 2013, 
and 2015 and reported that shoulder injuries are the most common complaint cited by 
other aquatic sporting populations as well ( e.g., elite water polo, high -diving, diving, 
synchronized swimming, OW and pool swimmers). They postulated that the upper limbs 
are responsible for generating the majority of the propulsive force to travel  through water 
across aquatic disciplines and  attributed this  to the increased  risk o f injur y to the 
shoulder complex  (Prien et al ., 201 7).  
 
2.2.1.2 Risk Factors  
Risk factors ass ociated with developing shoulder pain in pool swimmers are not 
universally agreed upon ; however, a systematic review  of various studies which utilized 
both self -administered surveys and clinical assessments,  by Hill et  al. (2015 ) concluded  
with a ‘moderate ’ degree of certainty that clinical joint laxity, glenohumeral rotation 
range of motion, previous history of pain and injury as well as the competitive level of 
the swimmer were associated with an increased  risk of injury  (no risk factors were listed 
with a ‘high’ degree of certainty of associat ion with shoulder injury ). It must be noted 
that a self -administered survey  cannot provide a valid measurement of glenohumeral 
laxity and range of motion , and therefore was not addressed in the questionnaire used in 
the current study . However,  there has been association reported between a history of 
traumatic shoulder injury and glenohumeral laxity , which suggests that future studies 
should distinguish  the nature of any prior injury reported  to yield more descriptive 
 
9 
 results  (i.e. traumatic vs overuse) (Hill et al ., 2015). The majority of investigations into 
the development and diagnosis of shoulder pain in swimmers has been done clinically , 
without the use of imaging ; however, Sein et al. (20 10) examined 52 competitiv e 
swimmers ’ shoulders via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). They found a positive 
association between training volume (weekly meterage and duration) and pain attributed 
to either internal or external rotation -inducted shoulder impingement (Sein et al. , 2010). 
They also reported that thickening of the supraspinatus tendon as evaluated by MRI was 
correlated with increased training time, training distance and cumulative shoulder use 
(Sein et al., 20 10). The MRI study by Sein et al. was one of twelve included i n a 2020 
systematic review by Feijen, et al., in which they concluded a level II level of evidence 
between the association of swim -training volume and shoulder pain in an adolescent 
population (15 -17yoa) and a level III level of evidence in young (<15yoa),  adult (18 -
23yoa) and masters (23 -77yoa) population s.  
The association between shoulder injury and biological sex has been investigated 
with varying results . Hill et al. (2015) cited five studies that investigated this association 
with only one retrospecti ve study reporting a significant increase in shoulder pain among 
female swimmers. This lead Hill et al. to refute an association between sex and shoulder 
pain. However, when one examines the other four studies cited by Hill et al ., it appears 
that at least  one of these studies suggested an  association between sex and shoulder pain 
prevalence. Kruger et al. (2012) investigated shoulder pain among a group of 282 
master’s swimmers and found a slightly elevated odds ratio of 1.34 (95% CI, 0.829 -
2.179 ) for shoul der pain among female swimmers . Additionally, in a retrospective 
survey of 194 Italian teenage swimmers, the authors reported that female swimmers were 
 
10 
 more likely to experience shoulder pain (Tessaro et al ., 2017).   Bak & Faun o (1997) 
proposed the increas ed risk of shoulder injuries in female swimmers may be associated 
with an average elevated number of strokes per lap (presumably due to shorter arms  on 
average ) as compared to their male counterparts. They proposed that b iomechanically , 
this may predispose  female swimmers to overuse injury  because of an increased average 
of strokes per lap  (Bak & Faun o, 1997). In conclusion, the possibility that female 
swimmers report an elevated number of shoulder injuries is inconclusive ; however, Bak 
& Faunn (1997) prese nted a plausible theoretical basis and the literature does not present 
a unified conclusion. Therefore, it is worthwhile to study th e relationship between sex 
and injury in OW swimmers, especially due to the presumed discrepancies in stroke 
count over the large distances covered in OWS events.  
 
2.2.2 Spine  Injuries in Swimmers  
 
2.2.2.1 Prevalence  
Axial  injuries are not uniformly tabulated across the literature . Two studies using  
data generated  from prospective injury and illness reporting software in  NCAA  
swimmers reported that neck injuries accounted for  3.2%  of total reported injuries , and 
the vague terms of  ‘back’  or ‘trunk’ injuries comprised 16.2%  of the total reported 
injuries (Chase et al ., 2013 ; Kerr et al ., 2015 ). Another prospective study of NCAA 
swimmer ’s reported that 21.5% of the total reported injuries were attributed to the neck 
and back , with no distinction between the  axial skeleton  segments  (cervical, thoracic, 
lumbar or sacral)  (Wolf et al ., 2009) . Furthermore, a systematic review by Hill et al. 
 
11 
 (2022) grouped neck and back together, but noted it was the third most commonly 
reported anatomical site for injury (behind the shoulder and knee) and cited incidence s 
(point -prevalence to  12 months)  varying from 18.4% to 47%.  Nevertheless, given th at 
reports of cervical pain are quite low , it appears that  neck pain  composes less of the 
injury burden than that of other areas of the axial spine. Yet it appears  more of an effort 
should be made in future research to specify  the precise anatom ic region o f any injuries 
reported.  
 There have been a handful of studies , most of which appear to come from the 
same research group, that specifically investigated  low bac k pain (LBP) within a pool 
swimming population and reported lifetime prevalence ranging from 2 3.5%-76% 
(Hangai et al ., 2009; Kaneoka et al ., 2007 ; Matsuura et al., 2019 a). Matsuura et al . 
(2019 a) investigated MSK injuries reported by Japan national swim mers from 2002 -
2008 and found  that lumbar  spine  injuries were more prevalent than any other injur y site, 
including the shoulder.  Although this is limited to a single national team and may be due 
to several  confounding factors  (e.g., coaching style, lifestyle factors, education regarding 
injury prevention, dryland workouts, etc.) , it is notable that LB P has been documented as 
being relatively problematic within a population of elite swimmers.   
Hangai et al . (2009) investigated the prevalence of LBP among various athletic 
populations , including swimmers,  in comparison to a non -athletic control group. The 
authors collected demographic information and asked clinical questions regarding the 
lifetime and past four -week incidence of LBP and its severity ; a midsagittal  MRI of the 
lumbar spine (L1 -2 to L5 -S1) was also reviewed  for each subject (Hangai et al., 20 09). 
The authors defined disc degeneration (DD) as either multi -level degeneration of grade I 
 
12 
 or higher, or a singular level of grade III, IV or V degeneration, according to a 
Phirrmann classification (Hangai et al., 2009). They reported an odds ratio of 2 .76 (95% 
CI: 1.24-6.49) for LBP in a sample of 47 university -level swimmers as compared to  a 
non-athletic control  population  (Hanga i et al., 2009).  Notably, swimmers and baseball 
players exhibited the  highest prevalence of multi -level  DD findings  (other sp orts 
included were basketball, kendo, soccer and running) ; however, the authors did not 
comment on the severity  of the DD , but they did note an  association between reported 
LBP and  the presence of DD (Hangai et al., 2009). Comparatively, Kaneoka et al . (2007) 
investigated the prevalence of LBP and lumbar DD in two distinct groups of swimmers : 
a ‘high -load’ group consisted of 56 university level swimmers and a ‘low-load’ group 
consisted of 28 swimmers who belonged to a recreational swim club. They found the 
prevalence  and severity of LBP to be similar between the two groups ; however, the 
‘high -load’ group exhibited significantly more DD when  evaluated by MRI , although  the 
authors reported no  association between LBP and DD within th is sample  (Kaneoka et al., 
2007). Although this study appears to be from a similar group of authors, their definition 
of DD was the presence of grade III, IV, or V degeneration evaluated segmentally , and 
they did not discuss multi -level findings (Kaneoka et al., 2007).  
These conflic ting findings  appear to be congruent with investigations associating  
DD and LBP in  the general population  (Brinjikji et al., 2015 ; Endean et al., 2011 ). In a 
systematic review, Brinjikji et al . (2015) concluded that imaging evidence of DD 
increases with ag e and is not highly correlated with the presence of LBP. Conversely , 
another systematic review  estimating the association of DD and LBP , as evaluated by 
MRI,  reported a metaestimate of an odds ratio of 2.5 (95% CI, 2.0 -7.4) (Endean et al., 
 
13 
 2011). Regardles s of the association between DD and LBP,  complaints of LBP among 
swimmers appear to be relatively common  within the pool -swimming population and the 
suggested mechanism , as reviewed below,  is shared with their OW counterparts (Hangai 
et al., 2009; Kaneoka et al., 2007).   
 
2.1.2.2 Risk Factors  and Mechanisms  (Cervical Spine)  
In their recent systematic review,  Hill et al. (2022) noted with a low level of 
certainty that sex  (female)  and training volume may be associated with the development 
of neck pain and L BP. In a retrospective survey study of 87 triathletes , Villavicencio et 
al. (2006) found an association between the development of neck pain and the number of 
previous sports -related injuries, although most athletes attributed their neck pain to 
cycling in stead of swimming.  
Pollard and Fernandez (2004) reviewed the possible mechanisms for cervical 
spine injuries in swimmers and noted that older swimmers may be more likely to develop 
neck pain due to an increased likelihood of degenerative changes such as d isc 
dysfunction and spondylosis throughou t the cervical spine. They noted that any deviation 
of the spine from the longitudinal axis could cause extension and rotation through the 
neck, which would create excess stress through the elements of the cervical spinal 
column and musculature (Pollard & Fernandez, 2004). This extension would occur if a 
swimmer was breathing or looking forward , which is rather disadvantageous  when 
swimming freestyle in a pool because neck extension while swimming  forces the hips to 
fall in the water and creates more drag (Pollard & Fernandez, 2004). Notably,  there is no 
guiding line to follow while OWS  and the swimmer must instead ‘sight’ , which is when 
 
14 
 the athlete looks forward above the water to orientate themselves. Depending on t he 
swimmer ’s technique and ability, as well as water and environmental conditions, 
swimmers may sight as often as every 6  to 20  strokes  with varying degrees of cervical 
extension , which would creat e a possible mechanism for injury  (Pollard & Fernandez, 
2004). It appears that t his has not been investigated within the available literature.   
 
2.2.2.3 Risk Factors  and Mechanisms  (Lumbar Spine)  
Seemingly  there has recently been an effort to describe low back injuries, their 
mechanisms, and possible risk factors  more specifically  within swimming -related 
literature . Reviewing  the proposed  mechanism for the development of lumbar pain, 
Nyska et al . (2000 ) suggested  that repeated lumbar flexion/extension during the butterfly 
and breaststroke may act as  a mechanism fo r spondylolysis in adolescent swimmers , 
although subsequent  studies have failed to find a  clear  association between stroke 
specialty and reports  of LBP (Capaci et al ., 2002; Kaneoka et al ., 2007; Nyska et al ., 
2002). Another  proposed mechanism associated w ith lumbar pain in swimmers is 
prolonged lumbar hyperextension , which place s excess  stress on the posterior structures 
of the lumbar spinal column  including the pars interarticularis and facet joints  
(Wanivenhaus et al ., 2012) . Matsuura et al. (2019b) inve stigated the immediate effect of 
deep trunk stabilization exercises on lumbar lordosis angles while swimming in 13 
university -aged swimmers. They reported a decrease in the lumbar lordotic angle  when 
swimming  (i.e. less extension through the lumbar segment s) immediately after the 
exercises were performed (Matsuura et al., 2019b).  It is important to note that this 
research was done in a healthy , pain -free, population of 13 university -aged swimmers, 
 
15 
 and would therefore provide only a theoretical basis for the  prevention or treatment of 
LBP in swimm ers using an exercise -based approach . However, the exercises utilized in 
this study were the same used in the ‘lumbar injury prevention project’ , which was 
initiated in 2009 with the Japanese national swim team (Mats uura et al., 2019a). The 
lumbar injury prevention project consisted of an initial period of education and 
instruction on prevention strategies for lumbar injury (i.e. trunk stabilization and core 
muscle activation) followed by guidance for daily implementa tion within the athlete’s  
subsequent training (Matsuura et al ., 2019a). The authors reported a significant decrease 
in the prevalence of lumbar injury  from 23.5% to 14.8% (p<0.05) after the program was 
implemented in 2009 and lasting until  data collection commenced in  2016 (Matsuura et 
al., 2019a). Perhaps with more research, the findings between both Matsuura papers 
could be extended and a link between deep muscle activation and LBP could be 
established (Matsuura et al., 2019a).  
A 2006 study by Villavicen cio investigated  neck and spine pain in 87 triathletes 
via a retrospective survey study. Through regression analysis, they reported two 
predictive factors for the development of LBP: the number of prior incidents of sporting -
related injuries, as well as th e number of triathlons the respondents participated in 
(Villavicencio et al. , 2006). They did not elaborate on these previous injuries, and 
although triathletes train in OWS , a higher proportion of their training time was reported 
to be spent on the bicycl e (Villavicencio et al. , 2006). Nevertheless, prior reports of 
injury were also included in the questionnaire  used in the current study .  
Notably, a  major difference between swimming in a pool compared to OWS is 
the presence of a  turn at  the wall after the  swimmer completes a  length of the pool ; this 
 
16 
 movement  inevitably involves a period of lumbar flexion , which  theoretically  would 
briefly unload  the posterior elements of the lumbar spine. Thus, OW swimmers may be 
more predisposed to prolonged hyperextensio n than pool swimmers due to the distance 
of the swimming events and the absence of an embedded moment of lumbar flexion 
while the swimmer turns at the wall of a pool.   
 
2.2.3 Hip, groin  and thigh  injuries in swimmers  
Hip, groin  and thigh  complaints are not  uniformly tabulated within the existing 
literature. Wolf et al . (2009) reported hip/thigh complaints in 7/94  (4.3%)  NCAA 
swimmers over the course of five years within one swim team , and Kerr et al . (2015) 
reported a 4.8% prevalence of hip/groin pain over four years in a separate study of 
NCAA swimmers and divers  (these populations were not separated for the statistical 
analysis). A nteromedial hip and thigh pain is typically attributed to adductor strain 
associated with the whip -kick motion of breaststroke  (Gaunt & Maffulli, 2011). Further, 
an investigation of 296 NCAA swimmers reported a 6.92% point -prevalence of hip pain  
in breaststroke swimmers as compared to 0% in non -breaststroke swimmers (Grote et al., 
2004). The authors also found that 42.7% of breast stroke swimmers compared to 5.8% of 
non-breaststroke swimmers had experienced an episode of hip pain that limited their 
ability to swim or kick breaststroke within the previous year (Grote et al ., 2004). Given 
that OW swimmers typically rely on freestyle s troke (and therefore using flutter kick), 
the prevalence of hip pain in an OW population was postulated to differ  from that 
reported in pool swimmers.  
 
17 
 Prior to the current study commencing,  the author participated in personal 
anecdotal conversation s with various groups of long-distance OW swimmers . It appear ed 
that the re was perhaps an  undocumented phenomenon of anterior hip discomfort and 
tightness (loosely referred to as “tight hip flexors”) that may be common within this 
population. A blog post from an A ustralian physical therapy group reported tightness and 
dysfunction in the rectus femoris, iliopsoas and tensor fascia latae to be common in 
swimmers and attrib uted this  to sustained, powerful activation of these muscles over a 
small range of motion of the  hip joint (Physiohealth, 2020). Kitamura et al. (2020)  
investigated the elastic moduli of the iliacus and psoas muscles  (separately) in 33 male 
college -level swimmers , 11 of which reported LBP and 21  healthy controls . They 
reported  that a higher  elastic m odulus of the psoas ( i.e., stiffer)  was correlated with the 
presence of LBP. Their study was of cross -sectional design ; however, they suggested 
two possible mechanisms for this: the first being that a stiffer psoas major would exert a 
force on the lumbar s pine favoring extension ( particularly  from L1 -L3) and the second 
being that increased tension through the psoas major would cause a shearing force 
through the lower levels of the lumbar spine (Kitamura et al., 2020). Both prolonged, 
exaggerated extension, as well as a shearing force could be responsible for the generation 
of pain within the lumbar region (Kitamura et al., 2020). This mechanism of LBP has 
also been investigated in other sports  as well ; Evans et al . (2005) found an association 
between tight h ip flexors, as measured by a modified Thomas test, and LBP in a group of 
elite golfers. The Evans study was included in a review article by Moradi et al . (2015)  
that reported a ‘moderate’ level of evidence that hip flexor tightness is positively 
associated  with LBP.  
 
18 
  
2.2.4 Knee  injuries in swimmers  
Knee pain represented only 6% of the total injury burden within a sample of 499 
masters pool swimmers (Baker et al ., 2019). The prevalence of knee injuries among 
competitive swimmers may be as high as  76%. Howev er, like hip pain, knee pain 
appears to disproportionally affect  competitive swimmers who specialize in breaststroke  
(Chase et al ., 2013; Gaunt & Maffulli, 2011). The biomechanics of the kicking motion 
for the breaststroke differs greatly from that of dolp hin kick or flutter kick used in 
butterfly and freestyle swimming, respectively , by including a rotary movement at the 
hip that results in a valgus force at the tibiofemoral joint  (Khod aee et al ., 2016). As 
above, because OW swimmers typically rely on a fr eestyle stroke, t he prevalence of knee 
pain in this population is likely to differ from that in pool swimmers.  
 
2.3 Global injury risk & associated factors  in swimmers  
 
2.3.1 Sex 
The association between swimming -related injuries and biological sex has bee n 
reported with no clear consensus reached; Martins et al . (201 4) surveyed 47 elite 
swimmers at the 2009 FINA World Championships and reported an 18% prevalence of 
injury in male  athlete’s  vs 75% in their female counterparts  without explanation . 
However, i t must be noted that when Prien et al. (2017) compiled the injury surveillance 
data from three FINA world championships (2009, 2013, 2015) this discrepancy was not 
maintained, and in fac t, was insignificantly reversed  with males reporting slightly more 
 
19 
 pre-competition injuries than female athletes in the four weeks leading up to  the 2015 
competition. An  increased prevalence of injury in female swimmers has also been 
reported in two separate samples of NCAA swimmers  and a group of Japanese national 
swim team  members , with two of these long -term studies  reporting a statistically 
significant difference in injury rates between the sexes  (Chase et al ., 2013; Wanivenhaus 
et al., 2012 ; Matsuura et al., 2019a ). There is currently no explanation widely offered to 
explain why female swimmers may be more predisposed to MSK injuries  and a 
definitive conclusion has not been reached within the literatur e. Perhaps it is due to 
smaller average body size, which would alter biomechanical factors  as previously 
discussed . Howeve r, this may also involve numerous other differences  related to sex and 
gender such as  anatomical characteristics,  hormonal or  neuromuscular control and/or 
societal or environmental variances (Lin et al., 2018).  
 
2.3.2 Previous history of injury  
 There  appears to be a global increased risk of injury when the athlete has a ny 
previous history of injury. In a prospective study of NCAA swimmers , Chase et al . 
(2013)  found an increased risk of injury, not only if the athlete reported previous pain at 
the same ana tomic site, but also if the athlete reported any prior incidence of injury at all. 
Additionally, Gosling et al . (2008) cited two studies that reported an increased incidence 
of injury in triathletes who have reported any prior history of injury or pain . Korkia et al. 
(1994) conducted  an eight -week prospective study of 155 British triathletes and reported 
an increased incidence of injury in those who reported they sustained an injury in the 
year prior to the beginning of the study onset . 
 
20 
  
2.3.3 Training Load   
Training load  (TL)  is a risk factor that has received recent attention due to its 
modifiable nature (Eckard et al., 2018).  It can be defined as “the cumulative amount of 
stress placed on an individual from single or multiple training sessions over a per iod of 
time”  (Eckard et al., 2018, p. 1930) and can be measured in a variety of ways . The 
quantification of training load is multifactorial and a number of metrics have been 
identified to best quantify this in relation to each individual athlete (Eckard et  al., 2018). 
These include external or internal training load (ETL/ITL) ; ITL involves the 
quantification of an athlete ’s response to loading and can be measure d objectively  (e.g., 
blood lactate , heart rate)  or subjectively  (e.g., self-reported measures) , while ETL is a 
purely objective measurement ( e.g., distance , duration).  Further, load quantification can 
also be classified as absolute or relative (Eckard et al., 2018). Relative loads consider  a 
number of external and internal metrics and tend to express variance in load across time 
periods , while  absolute loads are simply the sum of loading metrics over a given period 
of time  (Eckard et al., 2018). In a systematic review of 57 studies examining various 
measurements of training load and risk of injury, Eck ard et al. (2018) found that studies 
that monitored relative TL demonstrated that small to moderate changes in TL compared 
to previous loading was “associated with a reduced risk of injury compared with larger 
or smaller changes” (p.1957). This finding may  explain the findings in a study by Chase 
et al. (2013) who found that first -year NCAA swimmers were at an increased risk of 
injury as compared to 2nd through 4th year athletes , as well as the systematic review by 
Feijen et al . (2020) that reported a stron ger association between training volume and 
 
21 
 shoulder pain in adolescents (15 -18 years of age) vs. adults (18-23 years of age) . Both 
authors  postulated that this  phenomenon may be  due to the abrupt changes in TL that 
occur when the athlete enters competitiv e training as an adolescent, or moves from high 
school -level to university -level swim programs (Chase et al ., 2013 ; Feijen et al., 2020 ). 
Further, an earlier investigation by Wolf et al. (2009) also noted an increased prevalence 
of injury in college freshm an as they adapted to the new demands of collegiate -level 
training.   
The measurement of smaller cycles of TL is difficult within a retrospective 
survey study, as is a gross measurement of various internal or relative TL metrics ; 
however, it is  worthwhile t o investigate  aspects of swimmers ’ TL such as meterage  and 
duration across TL cycles (i.e. , seasons)  to obtain more information regarding 
progressive loading and training habits .  
 
2.3.4 Age 
Tate et al . (2012)  examined 236 swimmers aged 8 -77 and found that  masters 
swimmers aged 23  and over  (n=67) were not at an increased risk of shoulder pain in 
comparison to younger age groups (8 -11 years, 12 -14 years, 15 -22 years) ; however, they 
did not examine variances within this group to investigate if injury rates ch ange as 
masters athlete s age from their early twenties onwards . Conversely, Baker et al . (2019)  
did investigate global injury rates within a sample of 499 masters pool swimmers aged 
20-86 years and reported an increased risk of injury of 1.6% with every ye ar of 
increasing age. The authors negated the importance of this value ; however, if one 
considers a 16% increase over a 10 -year span, it may  warrant further attention.  Further, 
 
22 
 if this increase was not linear it would be interesting to note the trends the authors may 
have found .  Therefore, investigating the relationship between age and injury incidence 
should be prioritized.  
 
2.4 Injury Prevention  
 
2.4.1 Dryland warmups  
Dryland  warmups  prior to athletes entering the pool for a training session  appear 
to be a common practice in the pool swimming population  (Mcgowan et al.,2016) ; 
however, there appears to be only one study  investigating the relationship between 
dryland warmups and the incidence of injury. T essaro et al. (2017)  focused their 
investigation on  the prevention of injuries to the shoulder complex and conducted a 
retrospective observational study of eight groups of Italian  teenage competitive 
swimmers  (n=197) . They  found that a pre -swim dryland warm -up lasting  5-10 minutes 
was associated with a red uction in injury  whereas a warmup lasting over 10 minutes was 
associated with increased shoulder injury  (Tessaro et al., 2017). Given that OW 
swimmers may engage in the practice, and it has previously been shown to affect the 
incidence of injury, it is wor thwhile to investigate  this within an OW swimming 
population.  
 
 
 
2.4.2 Cross -training  
 
23 
  Cross -training or  participating in athletic activities outside of one’s primary sport, 
is a common method employed to maintain or improve sport  performance components 
such as aerobic fitness or muscular strength while off -loading the tissues exposed to the 
“repetitive stress of sport -specific training” (Baker et al ., 2019, p . 52). Baker et al . 
Conducted a survey study of 499 masters pool swimmers and investigated the 
association between injury prevalence and participation in a cross -training activity. They 
reported that swimmers who opted to participate in cycling, running or ‘dryland training’ 
activities reported significantly less injuries than those who did not. Conver sely, Tate et 
al. (2012) found that participation in water -polo was associated with an increased risk of 
shoulder pain, disability or dissatisfaction in a study of 236 female pool swimmers aged 
8-77 years of age. It must be noted that the shoulder injury r ate in water -polo is also 
elevated due to the reliance on the upper limb for propulsion , and the movement patterns 
used in water -polo would be similar to swimming, which in turn would fail to properly 
off-load the sport -specific musculature that is subject  to overuse injuries in the pool 
swimming population ( Prien  et al., 201 7).  
A survey study of 500 aquatic athletes competing at the 2017 FINA world 
championships reported that although injury rates remained stable across all countries 
regardless of success , the athletes competing for countries with higher rates of success 
reported higher participation in dryland injury prevention exercises (Mountjoy et al., 
2021).  The authors went on to note that this was an unexpected finding and may be 
explained by the fa ilure of their survey to capture the severity of the reported injuries 
(Mountjoy et al., 2021).  Further, a  recent review investigated the value of exercise 
therapy interventions on reducing shoulder pain and concluded that a 6 -to-8 week 
 
24 
 program that includ es strengthening and stretching exercises can decrease the incidence 
of shoulder pain in swimmers (Yoma, et al., 2022 ), although it must be noted that the 
swimmers had already sustained a shoulder and the program was being used as a 
treatment. It appears t hat there is a gap in the literature surrounding the effectiveness of 
targeted dryland exercises at preventing the onset of MSK injury.  
 
2.4.3 Preventative sports health care  
Currently there are no published studies investigating the role of preventative 
visits to health care professionals such as registered massage therapists, physical 
therapists, osteopaths,  or chiropractors  in the prevention of MSK injuries  in swimmers . 
As aforementioned, Mountjoy, et al . (2021) surveyed 500 elite aquatic athletes 
compe ting in the 2017 FINA world championships and found that countries ranking 
higher in the world standings had better access to support staff, including massage 
therapy and physical therapy. Furth er, personal communication with OW swimmers 
suggests that many  visit health care professionals in a preventative capacity.  Thus, 
descriptive statistics would be beneficial to understand the utilization of such services  in 
this population .  
 
2.5 Population comparison  
As described above, the majority of research on swi mming has been conducted in 
a population of elite pool swimmers. Howeve r, research conducted in  other populations 
may be used to aid the formulation of a hypothesis on injury rates in a recreational OWS 
 
25 
 population. Two populations of interest, triathletes and elite OW swimmers, will be 
highlighted below.  
 
2.5.1 Triathlon  
Like recreational OW swimmers , the demographics of those competing in 
triathlon appear to involve a wide array of ages and abilities, with the average participant 
in their mid -thirties ( Wicker et al., 2012). Since the swim portion of a triathlon is 
typically held in an OW setting, there may be similarities between triathletes and OW 
swimmers. However, t he triathlon population  typically  trains swimming differently than 
the monosport populati on by decreas ing the duration , frequency,  and meterage  of swim 
training (Schorn et al ., 2018) . In a study of 268 triathletes , 19% reported shoulder 
injuries attributed to overuse whereas 6% reported acute shoulder injuries (most of which 
were sustained whi le cycling)  (Schorn et al., 2018).  The authors noted a significant 
relationship between acute shoulder injury and weekly training time  in all three 
disciplines ; however, th e athletes that reported a shoulder injury due to overuse spent 
significantly more t ime swim -training (Schorn et al ., 2018). The  authors also reported an  
association between shoulder overuse injury and  hand -paddle use (a training aid) , as well 
as event participation (Schorn et al ., 2018). Other studies investigating injury prevalence 
in triathletes differed greatly due to the varied nature of the sport ( e.g., distances ranging 
from one to 18-hour long competitions). An dersen et al . (2013 ) reported 87 % of ironman 
distance triathletes reported an overuse injury during a prospective 26 -week s tudy, with 
the majority occurring in the lumbar spine or lower extremity.  The authors did not 
speculate on a mechanism for this, but other studies  have suggested that running may 
 
26 
 contribute to a majority of lower extremity injuries in triathletes (Korkia e t al., 1994; 
Zwingenberger et al., 2014).  Another study investigating injuries in amateur triathletes 
found that the  main risk factor for injury was participation in a formal triathlon event , 
they found trends suggesting those with higher performance level s and those who train 
over ten hours per week may have a higher injury rate (Zwingenberger et al., 2014). The 
authors did not find an association with age, visits to physical therapy or coaching status  
(Zwing enberger et al ., 2014).  
 
2.5.2 Elite Open Water  Swimmers  
Due to the surge in the population of aquatic -sport athletes , FINA has initiated an 
injury and illness surveillance program at their biennial World Championships and 
further recommended a program for out -of-competition injury and illness recordin g and 
surveillance  (Mountjoy et al ., 2016). Results have been published concerning data 
collected for the duration of the 2009, 2013 and 2015 world championships as well as a 
retrospective survey of injuries and illness in the four weeks leading up to the 2013 and 
2015 competitio ns (Prien  et al. , 2017). Noteworthy findings  include a high in -
competition injury rate for OW swimmers (52.5 injuries/1000 starts) as compared to pool 
swimmers (2.02 injuries/1000 starts) in 2009 and  a relatively low rate of pre -competition 
injury in the four weeks leading up to the 2013 event (17.4%) (Mountjoy et al ., 2010; 
Mountjoy et al ., 2015).  Unfortunately, the  authors did  not report  any specific data on the 
anatomic location of injury or the possible associated risk factors (Mountjoy et al ., 
2016) .   
 
 
27 
 2.6 Survey Design  
 Studies utilizing survey -based methods provide information by systematically 
asking questions  to study participants  (Guppy & Gray, 2008). One must first establish 
the purpose of the survey , and from there quest ions are designed and administered 
accordingly (Fowler, 2013). Survey -based research is a useful tool for statistical 
exploration of trends within a population ; however, the quality of a survey -based study is 
dependent upon the sampling, the question desig n, and the administration of the survey 
itself  (Creswell & Creswell, 2018; Fowler, 2013) . The current study employed  a 176-
question,  self-administered internet -based survey that ask ed swimmers about their 
swimming -related MSK injuries, as well as various d emographic data, training 
parameters, event participation , injury prevention strategies and COVID -related training 
changes that are further explained below.  
 
2.6.1 Cross -sectional study design  & recall bias  
Cross -sectional survey research is characterized  by participant responses given at 
a single point in time (rather than multiple responses administered at various times)  
(Field, 20 09). Given that a cross -sectional study is not a true experimental design  
(groups may be formed based on existing differences  only), the data collected can only 
be used for epidemiological and correlational statistics , as opposed to inferring causation  
(Field, 20 09).  
Since the data collection is limited to a single point in time and participants were 
asked to retrospectively id entify any swimming -related injuries they sustained within 
their most recent 6-month period of  training , the study is inherently subject to a level of 
 
28 
 recall bias. Historically, sports injury studies have utilized a 12 -month timeframe for the 
recollection of injury incidence to cover an entire season ; however, this has been 
challenged by a number of studies that have reported values ranging from 39% to 54% of 
athletes forgetting injuries within this period (Gabbe & Finch, 2003; Junge & Dvorak, 
2000). This led to current guidelines of injury surveillance in various sports 
recommending a prospective design with a seven -day recall (Mountjoy et al., 2016; 
Fuller et al., 200 7). Organized sporting regulatory bodies for elite athletes  with on -site 
medical staff  may have the resources to collect this data ; however, this may be 
unrealistic for their recreational counterparts. A similar problem was identified in the 
recreational running population and a recent consensus statement was released to provide 
uniformity to i njury surveillance studies (Yamato et al., 2015). The authors 
recommended that a 6 -month timeframe be used in an effort to minimize participants ’ 
forgetting not only the occurrence of an injury but also the details, such as location, 
duration, mechanism, d iagnosis and treatment (Yamato et al., 2015).  
On March 11, 2020 , the World Health Organization declared a global pandemic 
due to the COVID -19 virus outbreak (World Health Organization, 2020). In an effort to 
reduce transmission of the disease, a large num ber of jurisdictions across the globe 
restricted access to public pools and beaches and the majority of mass participation OW 
events were  cancelled (Kent, 2020 ; Griffiths, 2020 ). This ha d implications for the current 
project  because since March 2020, athle tes have had to significantly alter their training 
regimes as compared to the pre -COVID time -period. It was not ideal to conduct the 
survey amidst the restrictions but  given the global situation  that limited and altered  
participation in swimming -related ac tivities , we chose to maintain a 6 -month recall and 
 
29 
 the survey was open from April  to September 2021 . It is notable that during this period 
there were still restrictions on gathering sizes and international travel.  It would be 
prudent to conduct a  follow -up study in the post -pandemic time -period when access to 
training facilities and participation in training groups and event participation returns to 
an unrestricted state.  
 
2.6.2 Sampling  
As noted , the population of non -elite OW swimmers are quite diverse  and there is  
currently no overarching group to which all OW swimmers belong. As such, finding a 
sampling frame of this population is difficult , and therefore a nonprobability sampl ing 
method  must be employed. Nonprobability sampling methods introduce a sub jective 
element to the sample selecti on and in the case of convenience sampling (a type of 
nonprobability sampling), it is the characteristics of the participants that will influence 
their participation (Henry, 1990). A convenience sample is a self -selecte d sample 
recruited through public advertisements and t herefore , the assumptions of probability 
theory and sampling error do not apply and must be noted accordingly ( de Vaus, 2014 ). 
Although this type of sample hinders the ability to generalize the results of the study, it is 
useful for exploratory research and when practical constraints must be considered  (de 
Vaus, 2014).  
 
2.6.3 Self-administered surveys   
 Self-administered surveys allow the participant to complete the survey without 
the guidance of anothe r person  and at a time of their choosing (Fowler, 201 3). Further, if 
 
30 
 there are no time constraints on the survey, it allows participants time to complete it at 
their leisure  and they can check with other sources  before/during  the survey completion. 
This was desirable for the current project because it provide d participants the opportunity 
to consult medical records, diagnostic results, training logs or event details. Further, self -
administered questionnaires are more cost -effective and allow a greater reach  than one 
requiring personal administration (Fowler, 2013). A disadvantage of self -administered 
survey design is the inability of the researcher to clarify any ambiguous questions or 
survey directions for the participant (Fowler, 2013). Therefore, self -administered surveys 
must be designed with ease -of-use and clarity in mind .  
 
2.6.4 Question design  
Survey questions can broadly be grouped into open and closed  formatted  
questions ; respondents formulate their own responses to an open -ended question whereas 
they choose from a pre -set list of responses to a closed -ended question  (Fowler, 2013).  
Open -ended questions allow respondents to formulate their own answers to questions ; 
however, the answers may vary based on their interpretation of the question ( Fowler, 
2013 ). Fowler (2013) strongly recommends the use of closed -ended  questions (where 
appropriate) in self -administered questionnaires to increase the usability of data through 
clarification and consistency. Closed -ended questions  typically  increase the ease o f use 
of the survey, which may, in turn  improve  the likelihood of participation and completion 
of the survey.  
Survey questions must maintain a consistent meaning to all respondents (Fowler, 
2013). Variance in interpretation may be further compounded by th e distribution of the 
 
31 
 survey across various cultures , given that the educational experience and cultural 
background will affect each participant’s interpretation of the question (Fowler, 2013). 
For instance, a ‘medic’ typically refers to a medical doctor i n the United Kingdom , 
whereas  it typically denotes paramedic or emergency medical personnel  in North 
America. Thus, the questionnaire must be culturally sensitive with ample descriptions 
and synonyms available.  Cultural interpretation was addressed by havi ng three OW 
swimmers from different countries (Canada, the United Kingdom , and the United States) 
review the survey before it was distributed .  
There may be instances where the options available in a closed -ended question 
are not exhaustive. Therefore, ope n-ended response boxes were  included throughout the 
questionnaire (where appropriate) to allow participants to respond with answers not 
listed in the pre -set list of responses. For example, perhaps they consulted a reflexologist 
for a foot complaint and th is vocation was not listed in the pre -set list of options . 
 
Chapter  3: Objectives  & Hypothesis  
The objectives of this study are as listed below:   
1. To generate epidemiological data regarding injury prevalence within the non -elite 
OW swimming population duri ng the COVID -19 pandemic.  
2. To explore possible associations between reported injuries and identified risk 
factors and preventative strategies.  
Given the paucity of research in OW swimmers, this study primarily aimed to 
generate data and  information for us e in further research (hypothesis -generating 
research ). However , with consideration  given to previous research within the pool -
 
32 
 swimming population combined with anecdotal conversation s with OW swimmers , it 
was hypothesized that: 1) there would be a similar  or increased prevalence of lumbar 
spine and hip injuries reported within the OW swimmer population , and 2) there would 
be a similar prevalence of shoulder injuries reported  within the OW swimmer 
population .  
 
Chapter  4: Methods   
The study design was roote d in a post -positivist epistemology and used a self-
administered  internet -based  survey  to generate data relating to reported injuries in OW 
swimmers . Survey studies ask questions and participant responses can be used for 
statistical exploration of trends w ithin a population  (Creswell & Creswell, 2018) . 
Therefore, a population -based survey design was appropriate g iven that the purpose of 
this project was to estimate injury trends within the non -elite OW swimm ing population  
and explore possible associated  risk factors. A cross -sectional design was chosen over a 
longitudinal study  due to time constraints  associated with a Master’s  project. As noted,  a 
6-month recall period was used to remain consistent with recreational running -related 
literature ( Yamato et al. , 2015) . An internet -based survey was chosen in an effort to 
maximize the reach of the survey throughout the global population of OW swimmers.  
This project received approval on ethical grounds by the University of Regina 
Research Ethics Board on April 14,  2021.

 4.1 Definitions  
Recently,  Mountjoy et al . (2016) released a consensus statement in the British 
Journal of Sports Medicine and provided operational definitions and methodological 
recommendations for the reporting of aquatic sport -related illness  and injury. In an effort 
to maintain consistency within the literature, the following definitions were  used for the 
current study:   
 Injury: Any physical complaint or observable damage to body tissue 
produced by the transfer of energy  or sustained by an a thlete during 
participation in training or competing in an aquatic discipline, regardless of 
whether it received medical attention or its consequences with respect to 
impairments in competition or training . 
 Clinician: Anyone who is involved in the health c are of athletes, reviews 
medical or physiological information, and/or implements an action plan to 
improve the athlete’s health, where health is considered in a broad sense but 
must be more than just performance enhancement.  
 Medical attention: An injury o r illness where a qualified clinician assessed 
the athlete’s medical condition.  
 Time loss: A time -loss injury or illness leads to the athlete being unable to 
take full part in  swimming -related activities. If the athlete misses the rest of 
the training or competition session but returns for the next 
training/competition, this should be recorded as a time -loss incident.  
 Index injury: The first recorded injury in a series of injuries constituting a 
recurrent condition.  
 
34 
  Exacerbation: Injury to the same locati on and of the same type as the index 
injury, where the index injury has not completely healed.  
 Reinjury: Injury to the same location and of the same type as the index injury, 
where the index injury has completely healed.  
 Local injury: Injury to the same lo cation but a different type from the index 
injury.  
The cause, or mechanism of injury (MOI) (traumatic or overuse) may not present 
in congruence with its physiologic basis . For example, a lower back injury may be due to 
accumulated stress over time but may manifest as a single incident when an athlete exits 
the pool (Mountjoy, 2016). Because the physiologic definition is often difficult to 
discern, Mountjoy et al . (2016)  have recommended that the definitions regarding MOI be 
operational ly defined as:  
 Trauma tic injury: An injury caused by a single, clearly identifiable energy 
transfer. The mechanism of a traumatic injury can be further specified as (1) 
non-contact, (2) contact with another athlete/person or (3) contact with an 
object or animal.  
 Overuse injury : Refers to a condition caused by multiple accumulative bouts 
of energy transfer without a single, identifiable event responsible for the 
injury . 
 
4.2 Participants  
The target population for this study was adult non-elite long-distance OW 
swimmers  who self -identify as such and regularly compete or train in an OW setting. 
 
35 
 Inclusion criteria include d any English -speaking OW swimmer over the age of 18 years 
with access to the internet . Exclusion criteria included professional OW swimmers and 
those competing in the FINA international OWS circuit.  
The target sample size w as 250 participants to allow correlations to stabilize and 
provide ample power (Sch öndrodt & Perugini, 2013).  The survey was closed in 
September 2021 after 156 participants completed the survey  due to time constraints and 
challenges imposed by the COVID -19 pandemic .  
 
4.2.1 Participant Recruitment  
Study information w as dispersed through the following online avenues , and 
participation was via a voluntary opt -in basis by those who fulfill ed study c riteria.  
1. Swimtrek monthly newsletter: Swimtrek is a British travel company specializing 
in OW swim vacations and their email reach includes swimmers from the United 
Kingdom , the European Union , North America, and Australia. This connection 
was made via pe rsonal communication with the company , and they distributed 
the survey link in their July 2021 newsletter.  
2. Facebook posts: There are several  OWS  groups on the Facebook social media 
platform. These include the Dover channel training group, Dorset OW swimme rs, 
the Lake Ontario Swim Team (LOST), the Southern Ontario Swim, the 
Chesapeake Bay OW swimmers, as well as the re -posts from members of these 
groups to other connected groups with similar populations.  
 
36 
 3. Gatekeepers and snowball recruitment through word of  mouth: A handful of 
prominent figures within the long -distance swimming community graciously 
volunteered to spread study information through their social media avenues.   
 
4.3 Survey Design  
The survey was an original design composed of five sections : swim mer 
demographics, training habits, injury reports, event participation , and injury prevention 
strategies. This study employed  Qualtrics  (Provo, Utah, USA)  survey  software , and the 
piloting procedure included an internal review of the questionnaire by three  OW 
swimmers  from various countries of residence  as well as the author, supervisor, and one 
committee member .  
 
4.3.1 Demographics  
Demographic data collected include d age, sex, height, weight, geographic 
location , employment status, highest level of educat ion obtained , concurrent medical 
conditions and tobacco use . This was done to  gain insight into variables which may be 
related to injury, and also to investigate  the average demographics of the OW marathon 
swimming population.  
 
4.3.2 Injury  
Swimmers were  asked to recall any episode of injury that they had experienced 
within their most recent 6-month period of unbroken training  using the definitions 
provided by Mountjoy et al. in the 2016 consensus statement. Questions included  the 
 
37 
 location ; date; type (trau matic vs. overuse ); diagnosis (if applicable ); number of days 
that the injury resulted in the inability to train, modified participation or decreased 
performance ; any previous history of injury to that site ; and  treatment received (if 
applicable). Results were  categorized based on location and type of injury as outlined in 
the consensus statement  by Mountjoy et al. (2016).   
 
4.3.3 Training Habits  
Questions concerning training habits included  the number of years the swimmer 
has participated in swimming , then another specifying OWS , as well as  their weekly 
estimate of meterage and swim duration broken up by season  (i.e., periodization 
questions) , water type ( i.e., pool, fresh -water or salt -water) , and the proportion of 
training completed in a wetsuit . We also queried  the type and amount of cross -training, 
as well as their use of a training plan and/or coach  and type of group ( e.g., masters 
group, triathlon group, etc.) . 
 
4.3.4 Event Participation  
Participants were asked about their participation in OWS events during the 2018, 
2019, and 2020 season s, as well as their plans for the 2021 season. They reported on 
each events’ location, date and distance, and they elaborated on how COVID affected 
their 2020 participation as well as how it affected their plans for th e 2021 season.  
 
 
 
 
38 
 4.3.5 Injury Prevention Strategies  
Injury prevention strategies queried included  participation  (and duration)  in 
dryland warmup , resistance and/or core training , as well as any preventative health care 
sought out and the frequency of  such treatment. There was also an open -ended question 
regarding any other concerted efforts the swimmers may employ to prevent injuries that 
wasn’t addressed in the survey.  
 
4.4 Data collection  
 Qualtrics  survey software stores survey data and tabulates it into a spreadsheet 
format  available for download from their servers . All data is encrypted and made 
anonymous by Qualtrics.  The survey was opened  in April 2021 and was closed in 
September 2021  (i.e., data collection took place over a 4.5 month time period) .  
 
4.5 Statistical  Analysis  
 
4.5.1 Data entry and data cleaning   
The survey data was downloaded from Qualtrics via a Microsoft Excel file that  
was used for the initial process of data entry. The data were cleaned by manual 
inspection by the principal  investigator , and outlying , abnormal or missing entries were 
checked against the Qualtrics output and corrected or omitted, as necessary. Data used 
for logistic regression were then transferred to an SPSS file for further analysis.  
 
 
 
 
39 
 4.5.2 Descriptive Statis tics 
Continuous variables were  described with means with standard deviations and 
medians. Where appropriate , minimum  and maximum values were also reported. 
Categorical data were described with frequency and percentile proportions.  Descriptive 
statistics we re computed using Microsoft Excel (Version 16.65).  
 
4.5.3 Factors associated with MSK injury  
Logistic regression was computed using SPSS  software  (Version 2 7, SPSS, Inc., 
Chicago. IL) to explore the  variables that may be  associated with MSK injury . Logist ic 
regression is appropriate when  continuous or categorical independent variables are used 
to predict a binary categorical  outcome  (Field, 2009; Bewick et al ., 2005). We chose to 
use a hierarchical  method to build the regression model (, Field, 2009). The outcome 
variable used was whether participants reported at least one injury within the past six 
months. The predictor variables , listed in order of the steps used in the logistic regression 
were as follows:  
 Step 1 included  demographic variables (age, body  mass index (BMI), sex, and 
training years) . These were entered into the model first because age  and sex  have 
previously been reported to be associated with onset of injury as described in 
Chapter 2.1.1.2 (p.5), 2.2.1 (p.14) and 2.2.4 (p.17). BMI and train ing years were  
included in this section because the categorization fit within demographic variables.   
 Step 2 included training variables (periodization and participating in cross -training) . 
These were entered  second into the model because of prior research  suggesting a 
 
40 
 potential association of these variables with injury risk as described in Chapter 2.3.2 
(p. 18) .  
 Step 3 included the amount of time participants wore a wetsuit (never, sometimes or 
always) . This was added into the model as a separate step be cause swimmers that 
follow MSF rules cannot wear a wetsuit during their swims, and we wanted to see if 
this variable would have an independent  effect on the overall model.  
 Step 4 included  the amount of time participants trained in salt water ( more or less  
than 50%) . Salt water is more dense  than fresh water, which  affect s human 
buoyancy and swimming mechanics (Harri es, 1983).  Therefore , this was also added 
in separately  for the same reason as Step 3 .  
 Step 5 included whether or not the participants engaged  in efforts related to  injury 
prevention .  
 Step 6 included whether  the participants only competed  in OWS as a triathlete .  
 Step 7 included the total distance (metres) each participant completed as part of their 
competitive events during the 2018, 2019, and  2020 seasons. We chose to input the 
total event competition distance each participant completed within the 2018 -2020 
seasons as a continuous variable in the analysis (Zwingenberger et al., 2014).  
 
Statistical significance was set at  = 0.05.  
  
 
41 
 Chapter  5: Results  
 
5.1 Response Rate  
156 participants completed or partially completed  the survey . However, because 
some questions did not apply  to certain participants  (for instance, minimum and 
maximum training meterage  and duration  did not apply to individuals  who do not 
periodize their training) , or because some participants did not answer all questions, the 
denominator used for the statistical analys es did not remain consistent at 156 (range 1 09-
156).  
 
5.2 Epidemiological data regarding injury  
 
5.2.1 Injury P revalence, Location and Causation  
The 6 -month prevalence of swimming -related MSK injury within this sample 
population was 30% (n=36), of which 18 (36.7%) resulted in a time -loss injury. Eleven 
individuals (9.2% of the total, or 30.6% of those reporting inj uries) reported more than 
one injury and a total of 49 injuries were recorded. Table 1 provides further details 
regarding injury frequency and location; percentages are reported from the total number 
of injuries reported (n=49). Twenty -five (51.0%) involve d the shoulder (including the 
clavicle), 6 (16.7%) involved the cervical spine (neck) and 3 (6.1%) involved the lumbar 
spine.

  Thirty -one (63.3%) injuries were not attributed to a clearly identifiable incident . 
The remainder were attributed to contact with another swimmer, object or animal (n=6; 
12.2%) , or a single, non -contact incident (n= 12, 24.5%). Twenty -five (51.0%) of the 
injuries reported were a first -time injury to the area specified, while 5 (10.2%) were 
reported as a second -time injury and 19 (38.8%) were a reinjury that had occurred 
‘multiple -times’ prior. Of the injuries that wer e recurrences, 13 (54.2%) had originally 
happened as a swimming -related injury, while 11 (45.8%) were original injuries that 
occurred elsewhere (e.g., work, other sports, etc.).  
 
5.2.2 Treatment and Activity Modification  
Sixteen (32.7%) injuries did not r equire treatment, 15 (30.6%) were treated by 
one health care practitioner (HCP), and 18 (36.7%) were treated by more than one HCP. 
Physical therapists were consulted most frequently (n=20; 40.8%), followed by medical 
doctors (n= 16; 32.7%) and massage ther apists (n=14, 29.6%). A further breakdown of 
treatments sought by the participants is recorded in Table 2; percentages were calculated 
from the total number of injuries reported (n=49).

 Nine (18.4%) injuries required no modification to the swimmers training regime, 
15 (30.6%) resulted in an initial period where the swimmer was unable to train followed 
by a period of mo dified training, 22 (44.9%) resulted in modified participation and 3 
(6.12%) resulted in an inability to train. Of those that resulted in modified participation, 
8 (21.6) lasted less than one week, 11 (29.7%) lasted between one week and one month, 
11 (29.7 %) lasted between one and six months, 6 (16.2%) lasted over six months, and 1 
(2.7%) respondent was unable to remember the injury duration. Of those that resulted in 
an inability to train, 3 (16.7%) lasted less than one week, 8 (44.5%) lasted between one 
week and one month, and 7 (38.9%) lasted between one and six months.  
 
5.3 Demographic Characteristics of the Study Population and Descriptive Statistics  
 
5.3.1 Sociodemographic characteristics  
Sociodemographic characteristics, including participant location , age, sex, self-
reported body mass index (BMI), location and education level are presented in Table 3. 
Three  males and five females did not provide their age , and one female did not provide 
their height or body mass . Nine individuals did not specify their sex. Age distribution

 5.3.2 Training Characteristics  
The majority of swimmers (n=89 ; 69.0%) reported they started training as a 
swimmer when they were under 19 yea rs of age ; however, there was one respondent who 
began training at 60 years of age.  The average age respondents began training as a 
swimmer was 18.1 ( 14.6) years and the median was 10 years  (range 3 to 60 years) .  The 
average number of years participants reported actively training was 19.4 ( 13.9) years 
and the median was 15 years  (range 1 to 62 years) . The average number of years 
participants reported training as an OW swimmer was 10.1 ( 11.0) years, with the 
median being 6 years  (range 1 to 62 years) . Figure 2 illustrates the frequency of 
swimming vs. OW swimming experience of the respondents  and highlights the finding 
that although a large majority of the respondents had many years of  swimming 
experience, most respondents were relatively new to OW swimmi ng; roughly one-third 
of respondents had been OW swimming for under 5 years and over half had less than 10 
years of OW experience.

Eighty -six (63.7%) swimmers reported periodizing their training schedule either 
based on the season (n=39 ; 45.4%) , their competition schedule (n=46 ; 53.5%) , or on 
‘other’ rationale  and did not elaborate  (n=1; 1.2%) . Those that do not period ize their 
training reported swim ming  an average of 8560 ( 6295) meters and 4.1 ( 2.4) hours per 
week, with a range from 1000 -25000 meters and .5 to 10 hours weekly. The minimum 
values for those that periodize their training  (i.e., when they are training th e least 
throughout the year)  was an average of 5540 (  7842) meters and 2.49 ( 2.69) hours per 
week, with a range from 0 to 60000 meters and 0 to 18 hours ; their maximal values (i.e. , 
peak training season) was an average of 19390 ( 15779) meters and 8.27 ( 4.95) hours, 
with a range from 3000 to 80000 meters and 1.5 to 20 hours per week.  
Fifty -two (38.7%) swimmers reported training either as an individual or with one 
group  or team  (i.e., masters  swimming club , informal open -water  group ), with 32 05101520253035404550

more than one group  or team, or a combination of a team and individually . The results 
are reported further  in Table 4; please note that the percentages are based on the number 
of individuals who answered the question rather than the total number of responses , thus 
giving the percentage of individuals that participate in each manner of training.  
Fifty (41.3%) swimmers reported they never wear a wetsuit when training in 
OW, 50 (41.3 %) reported they wear a wetsuit some of the time and 21 (17.4%) reported 
to wear it all the time.

5.3.3 Event Participation  
Data were collected for event pa rticipation occurring in 2018, 2019, 2020 and 
2021. Data from the 2018 and 2019 seasons were considerably different than 2020 and 
2021 data due to the onset of the COVID -19 pandemic and the resulting restrictions. In 
2018 and 2019, 64.2% (n=77) and 63.5% ( n=73) of respondents , respectively,  had 
participated in at least one event. In 2020 , this number decreased to 35.7% (n=40). 
However, 71.6% (n=78) of respondents reported that they were training for a 2021 event.  
Of those who competed in 2018 , there was an average of 2.39 ( 1.31) events per 
participant (of those who reported participating in events ); there was a similar average of 
2.39 (1.45) events per participant  in 2019 , and 2020 event participation dropped to 1.81 
(1.11) events per participant  with 88 (80%) respondents noting that COVID -19 
restrictions had affected their intended event participation . The data from 2021 were 
 
53 
 collected mid -season and were based on both past and future events; an average of 2.34 
(1.29) events per participant (of those who  participate in events) was reported. Based on 
the events described and each participant ’s longest recorded event , 13 (11. 3%) 
participants competed in OW events solely as multi -sport athletes (i.e. , triathl etes), 35 
(29.7%) participated in events under 10k m long, 23 (19.5 %) participated in events from 
10 to 20km long and 16 (13.6%) participate d in events longer than 20km.  
 
5.3.4 Cross -Training and Injury Prevention  
Ninety -nine respondents (82.5%) reported participat ing in cross -training 
activities. See Table 5 for a further  breakdown of each type of activity . Percentages are 
based on number of participants who answered the question (n=120) . The r easons behind 
participation in cross -training events included enjoyment (n=75; 62.5%), efforts to 
increase swimm ing performance (n=28; 23.3%), prevention of swimming -related injuries 
(n=18;15%), general fitness and health (n=7, 5.8%) and other (n=10; 8.3%) reasons.

With regards to injury prevention,  30 (27.5%) swimmers report ed they make no 
effort to prevent swimming -related injuries, 55 (50.5%) reported they visit some type of 
preventative health  care, and 42 (38.5%) report ed they complete a dry -land warmup. 
Percentages are based on the number of respondents to the question (n=109). Other 
efforts are listed in T able 6 along with a further breakdown. The average duration of a 
dryland warmup was 10.6 ( 6.9) minutes.

5.3.5 Effect of the COVID -19 Pandemic  
A series of questions were asked regarding how restrictions due to the COVID -19 
pandemic affected each swimmer ’s training. Ninety -six (89%) re spondents noted a 
period where their training was somehow affected by various COVID -19 restrictions ; 76 
(80%) reported there was a period they were unable to swim, with the average period 
 
56 
 being 21.1 ( 16.9) weeks. Average distance and duration in the water  was also affected; 
81 (86.2%) swimmers reported their average meterage has changed  and 83 (88.3%) 
respondents reported a change in duration.  Not surprisingly, the way respondents train 
has also changed; 61 (64.9%) reported that they have had to alter who they train with . 
Other notable answers included 1 5 individuals who  described  increas ing the time they 
were able to swim in  OW and 5 individuals who reported  they started OW swimming 
due to limited pool -availability or safety concerns with indoor swimming.  
 
5.4 Prediction and Injury Risk Factors  
 A logistic regression was performed using a hierarchical entry method  with 7 
steps.  Using MSK injury as the outcome variable, Step 1 included demographic 
information (age, BMI, Sex and Training Years) as the predic tor variables  for reasons 
described in Chapter 4.5.3 (p. 33) (Table 7). For step 1, th e overall model is not 
significant ; however, there is a trend ( p < .10) for age and  sex (female) to be independent 
predictors in the final model.

Training information (periodization and cross training) were included in Step 2 as 
the predictor v ariables (Table 8). This step did not make a significant contribution to the 
model  (p = .570), and both variables that were added to the model were not significant 
independent predictors (p > .2).

The amount of time spent training in a wetsuit ( never, sometimes, always) was 
the predictor variable included in Step 3 (Table 9), and the amount of time spent training 
in salt water (more or less than 50%) was included in Step 4 (Table 10). Neither step 
made a significant contribution to the model  (p > .7), nor was either of the new variable s 
found to be a significant  independent predictor (p > .4).

 Chapter  6: Discussion  
The current study was the first to investigate injury prevalence in a non -elite OW 
swimming population. The primary aim was to generate data regarding the characteristic 
injuries sustained  within this population and their assoc iated 6 -month prevalence. A 
secondary objective was to investigate possible risk factors associated with injury onset.   
 
6.1 Injury Prevalence  
This study aimed to generate epidemiological data concerning 6 -month injury 
prevalence within a non -elite populat ion of OW swimmers and to explore possible 
associations between injury and risk factors/preventative strategies. Our findings suggest 
a 6-month injury prevalence of 30.0% with most injuries occurring to the shoulder 
complex (51.0%). Shoulder injuries are c ommonly reported to be the most prevalent 
among swimmers, presumably due to the shoulder generating much of the propulsive 
force when moving through the water (Wanivenhaus et al., 2012).   
The second highest prevalence (12.2%) was injuries to the cervical spine (neck). This 
is rather inconsistent with the previous literature of pool swimmers and other aquatic 
athletes with either the lower back (lumbar spine) or knee being the second most 
prevalent area of injury (Wanivenhaus et al., 2012; Prien et al., 201 7; Baker et al., 2019). 
Upon closer examination of the article by Mountjoy et al. (201 5) that investigated the 
injuries in the four weeks leading up to and during the 2013 FINA world championships, 
“head and neck” accounted for the greatest number of new -onset injuries among the OW 
swimmers. This was conveyed within a figure and not discussed within the body of the 
article’s text. Interestingly, there were 5 reports of head and neck injuries among 87 OW 
 
66 
 swimmers that responded to the surveys (one retrospect ive and one prospective), which 
would indicate that 5.7% of OW swimmers reported a head or neck injury (Mountjoy et 
al., 2014). In comparison, there were 23 head and neck injuries reported among the 329 
water polo players that responded to the surveys (7.0 %) and 4 head and neck injuries 
reported among 464 pool swimmers (0.9%) (Mountjoy et al., 201 5). Common among 
water polo and OWS is the possibility of physical contact between athletes, as well as the 
necessity to look forward while swimming (as discussed in Section 2.1.2.2 ). It would be 
interesting to note the mechanism (i.e., overuse vs. Contact) to provide more information 
regarding the etiology of the cervical injury in these populations.  
Lumbar complaints composed the third most common injury in the c urrent study (n = 
3, 6.1%), which did not support the hypothesis that low back and hip pain may be of 
increased prevalence within the OW population.  
 
6.2 Sociodemographic Characteristics  
It appears that the sociodemographic characteristics of swimmers and  triathletes is 
rather varied. In most studies of triathletes, young (30 -40 years), male participants were 
the majority; however, in studies involving masters swimmers, the majority was often 
female and slightly older (average age reported from 47.1 -55.3 y ears) (Baker et al., 
2019; Wicker et al., 2012; Kruger et al., 2012; Villavicencio et al., 2006). In the current 
investigation, there was a predominance of female swimmers (64.6%) and an average 
age of 47.7 ( 12.4) years, which appears to align with other studies of masters pool 
swimmers. Two studies concerning OW swimmer demographics were found for 
comparison; however, both studies involved a sub -set of the wider demographic. 
 
67 
 Nuckton et al. (2014) studied 103 recreational OW swimmers who were members of a 
winter swimming club in San Francisco; 76 were men and only 27 female. Nikolaidis et 
al. (2018) assessed the performances of successful triple crown swimmers from 1875 -
2017, and only 553 (29%) of the 1875 finishers were female.  It must be noted that both 
of these populations would be classified as a sub -set of OW swimmers (ice swimmers 
and channel swimmers), and their summer -swimming and shorter distance counterparts 
may have a larger proportion of females.  
In the current study, the average BMI was 26.7 ( 4.8) kg/m2, which would be 
categorized as ‘overweight’. This was slightly higher than that found among the 103 
cold-water swimmers in San Francisco (25.9 kg/m2) and the pool -swimmers at the 2009 
World Masters Games (25.8 2.8 kg/m2) (Crow et al., 2014; Walsh et al., 2013 ). Perhaps 
OW swimmers have a slightly higher BMI than their pool -swimming counterparts due to 
cold tolerance; elevated BMI was found to be associated with greater cold tolerance and 
longer time spent in the water among a sample of OW swimm ers (Nuckton et al., 2014). 
Notably, our population is not confined to a single club, country or continent. It is also 
important to note that our survey was open from April to September 2021, which was 
after several COVID -19 lockdowns world -wide. As docume nted by two studies, one in 
China and another study in the United States, a significant proportion of participants in 
both studies reported weight gain during the COVID -19 pandemic (Mulugeta et al., 
2021; Zhu et al., 2021). A retrospective study analyzing the anthropometric data within 
the files of 11534 adults in Massachusetts, reported the average weight gain of those who 
gained weight (95% CI) was 3.41 (3.29, 3.58) kg in men and 3.09 (2.98, 3.19) kg in 
women (Mulugeta et al., 2021). This resulted in an a verage increase (95% CI) of 1.12 
 
68 
 (1.05, 1.18) kg/m2 among the men and 1.19 (1.15, 1.24) kg/m2 among women (Mulugeta 
et al., 2021). From a sample of 889 survey respondents in China, Zhu et al. (2021) 
reported that 30.6% of the population reported an average  weight gain of 0.5 ( 2.8) kg. 
Therefore, the elevated BMI found in the current study may have been a by -product of 
the COVID -19 pandemic rather than being indicative of the general OWS population.   
The educational level reported by our respondents was co nsistent with that of 
Canadian Master’s pool swimmers, triathletes, and a broader group of “endurance 
athletes” (Larson et al., 2021, Wicker et al., 2012; Kowalski, 1999). The population 
appears to be highly educated, with all studies reporting 29.0 to 39. 0% of respondents 
having obtained a Bachelor’s  degree, 23.0 to 28.1% having obtained a Master’s degree 
and 10.0 to 15.9% of respondents having obtained a PhD or Professional degree (Larson 
et al., 2021; Kowalski, 1999). Larson et al. (2021) suggested that the socioeconomic 
profile of the swimmers may reflect characteristics of the youth population that carry 
over into adulthood.  
 
6.3 Risk Factor Analysis  
 This study used logistic regression to explore the relationship between thirteen 
possible predictor var iables and a report of at least one  injur y in the prior 6 months  (the 
outcome variable). The only significant independent predictor of injury was the 
respondent having reported to engage in efforts to prevent injury (OR [95%CI] = 5.004 
[1.356, 18.465], Wal d=5.843, p=0.016). The reason for this is unknown . However, since  
the start date of the injury prevention efforts was not requested in the survey , perhaps  
those that ha d sustained a n injury are the individuals that are currently participat ing in 
 
69 
 efforts to  prevent injuries in the future. Another explanation may be the reverse; those 
that have injured themselves in the past may be more likely to engage in injury 
prevention because of past experiences , but also may have been more likely to be injured 
again (h ence, the current injury) . It would be prudent to explore this potential association 
with more in -depth analyses in future studies.  
 The final model also included two variables that displayed a non -significant trend 
to predict injury; age (OR [95%CI] = 1.0 39 [0.996, 1.084], Wald = 3.093, p = .079) and 
sex (female) (OR [95%CI] = 2.614 [0.852, 8.021], Wald = 2.821, p = .093) . Baker et al. 
(2019) also reported a 1.6% per -year increase in the odds of sustaining an injury among 
the 499 master ’s swimmers t hey sur veyed  ((OR = 1.016, 95 % CI = 1.001 -1.030; p < 
0.05). An association of increasing  injury with age has also been reported in the 
recreational running population  (Johnston et al., 2018) . Both Kruger et al. (2012) and 
Tate et al . (2012) did not find a relati onship between age and shoulder injury ; however, 
Tate et al. Grouped master’s  swimmers into one category and compared them to brackets 
of younger age-group swimmers, and Kruger et al. used 10-year age brackets and found 
a non -significant association betwee n age and shoulder pain above 55 years of age.  
Female swimmers may also be at an increased risk of injury . This association has 
been demonstrated in other swimming populations and is a relatively well -established 
phenomenon in other populations for certai n characteristic injuries . For instance, ACL 
rupture and bone stress injuries occur at higher rates among adolescent female 
populations as compared to their male counterparts (Lin et al., 2018). Explanations for 
this are quite varied . As previously discuss ed, the smaller average body size among 
 
70 
 females leads to more repetition required to travel a pre -determined distance  (Bak & 
Fauno, 1997 ; Gupta et al., 2020 ). Other explanations may include anatomical variance  
(e.g., smaller ligament size or decreased femo ral notch width), physiologic differences 
(e.g., age of menarche,  hormonal factors), or differences in neuromuscular control or 
biomechanical risk factors ( e.g., landing mechanics) (Lin et al., 2018). Although i t is 
important to note the phenomenon, it mus t be linked to a specific risk factor and cause in 
order to establish effective prevention strategies (for instance, prevention programs for 
ACL injuries being implemented in female soccer programs).   
 
Chapter  7: Strengths and Limitations  
The current study utilized a cross -sectional design asking participants to r ecall  
injuries sustained during the most recent  6-month period on a self-administered internet -
based survey. This design has been chosen due to practical limitations of time  and 
money , as well as  an effort to maximize the reach of the survey . Due to the retrospective 
nature of the survey questions , a limitation of this study is the phenomenon of recall bias.  
There appears to be no literature comparing the effects of recall bias between 6 and 18 -
months; however , Gabbe and Finch (2003) noted discrepancies in recall in as little as 2-
months , and Junge and Dvorak (2000) noted that discrepancies may not only include 
occurrence , but the severity of injury as well.  Therefore, due to recall bias , the repor ted 
prevalence in this study may underestimate the actual injury rate in this population 
(Swimming Canada, 2020; Griffiths, 2020). Further, a  cross -sectional design differs from 
a longitudinal study because it represents injury prevalence at a snapshot in time, and 
 
71 
 therefore, one cannot infer causation from any conclusions  drawn (Creswell & Creswell, 
2018).   
As with any voluntary survey data, response bias  (i.e., a difference between 
respondents and non-respondents ) may also be a limitation. To investigate this 
possibility, Creswell and Creswell (2018) recommend conducting a wave analysis where 
select questionnaire items are analyzed on a week -by-week basis to determine if the 
average responses are changing throughout the course of the study. This was not do ne, 
but recruitment was staggered with the first social media recruitment post being made on 
April 22, 2021 and revisited monthly until August 2021.  
Nonprobability samples are comparable to samples that result from very low 
response rates (Fowler, 1993). This is because respondent characteristic s influence 
whether or not the individual will respond  (Fowler, 1993) . Fowler (2013) has identified 
many studies that conclude that individuals who are inherently interested in the research 
subject ( e.g., have been injured in the past or are interested in research) are more likely 
participate in the study. Therefore, it is important to identify and highlight such 
characteristics.  
Since  there were some missing data points, the resulting analysis might not be 
represent ative of the sample population.  This could have been mediated by increasing 
the sample size of the study. Ideally, the sample size would have been over 400 
participants, as recommended by Bewick et al., (2005). However, this was not possible 
due to time li mitations with the project.  
As noted , survey questions are subject to interpretation by the respondent. During 
data cleaning, it was apparent that some questions required clarification or were poorly 
 
72 
 understood by some of the respondents . For instance, par ticipants were asked if and how 
they periodized their training and one respondent selected ‘no’ to indicate that their 
training was not periodized, and therefore remained stable throughout the year. Yet later, 
they indicated they “…only swim in the sea. In  the summer I swim 5 miles in a week. In 
the winter, maybe 100m per week”. Therefore, the respondent clearly misunderstood the 
question and the data provided was not congruent with other responses.  
 
Chapter  8: Conclusion  
 This study aim ed to investigate  the MSK injury profile of non-elite OW 
swimmers and gain insight into possible risk factors associated with such injury. 
Currently there is no published data specific to OW swimmers  for the athlete , coach  or 
the health care professionals to consult when bui lding training and competition 
schedules . Rather,  injury prevalence  and epidemiologic data are generalized  from the 
pool swimming population, which negates the di fferences in di stance , venue 
characteristics  and the unpredictable environmental conditions in which  OW swimmers 
compete and train . The results of this study indicate our respondent characteristics are 
congruent with other studies with a few minor differences. Similar to most swimming 
literature, shoulder injury prevalence was reported as highest i n this population. 
Surprisingly, injuries to the cervical spine were the second most common injury . Future 
consideration should be given to developing comprehensive shoulder and cervical injury 
prevention strategies ; however, it would be beneficial to cond uct further investigation 
into etiology and associated risk factors before doing so . Statistical  analysis indicated a 
trend towards  injury risk increasing  with age and in females (sex) . The only significant 
 
73 
 independent predictor of injury in our model was whether or not the swimmer engages in 
efforts of injury prevention. However, there are many confounding variables that may be 
associated with this finding.  Future plans include  disseminat ing pertinent findings to the 
OW swimming population , not only throug h peer -reviewed literature  accessible to health 
care providers,  but also  through  media outlets popular among the OW population ( e.g. 
Outdoor Swimmer  magazine).
