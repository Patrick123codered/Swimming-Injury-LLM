Abstract: Background and Objectives : This study was conducted to examine the inﬂuence of different
swimming and running protocols as forms of physiological preconditioning on an isolated rat heart’s
ischemia/reperfusion injury. Materials and Methods : This study was conducted on 60 male Wistar
albino rats (6 weeks old, bw: 200 20 g), divided into: CTRL group—a sedentary control group;
sAeT—a group that underwent aerobic swimming conditioning using a swimming protocol for
8 weeks; sAnT—a group that underwent anaerobic swimming conditioning; rAeT—a group that
underwent aerobic running conditioning; and rAnT—a group that underwent anaerobic running
conditioning. After the preconditioning protocols, ex vivo estimating of myocardial function accord-
ing to the Langendorff technique was performed. Results : The anaerobic running training decreased
heart rate and the anaerobic swimming training reduced coronary ﬂow, demonstrating the difference
in the physiological heart response of aerobic/anaerobic physical training ( p< 0.05). Heart rate
was signiﬁcantly reduced in both training swimming groups after a period of ischemia ( p< 0.05).
On the other hand, the anaerobic running protocol induced a signiﬁcantly decreased heart rate in
comparison with the aerobic running group and the sedentary group ( p< 0.05). Conclusions : The data
from this experimental study support many protective training effects, i.e., improved contractility,
improved resting heart rate, and increased physical work capacity and exercise tolerance. Physical
training in the form of anaerobic running induces greater heart preconditioning for reperfusion injury
in comparison with anaerobic swimming training.

1. Introduction
According to the World Health Organization, the most common causes of death in
many parts of the world are different cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Reports suggest that
among various cardiovascular diseases, the most frequent cause of death lies in ischemic
heart disease (IHD) [ 1,2]. IHD is often caused due to coronary artery stenosis, leading
to insufﬁcient blood circulation and decreased blood perfusion of the heart, resulting in
ischemia, reduced metabolism, and irregular cardiac function [3–8].
The treatment and therapy of IHD in recent decades represent one of the biggest tasks
of the health community, where the emphasis is mainly on a pharmacological approach,
i.e., the development of a large number of pharmacological agents in the control and
treatment of ischemic heart disease [ 9]. Apart from the therapeutic problem, it is well
known that the prevention of a possible ischemic event can be an important factor in
reducing the consequences of this disease, both in terms of the clinical picture and in
terms of treatment costs. Therefore, in order to prevent the myocardium from I/R injury,
a preconditioning procedure was developed, which is a procedure for the protection and
prevention of the myocardium from impending ischemic and reperfusion damage, and
which is carried out using pharmacological and non-pharmacological principles [ 10]. One
of the non-pharmacological types of preconditioning—physical activity—was shown to be
potentially the most effective with numerous promising results in this ﬁeld [10–12].
A known fact is that regular aerobic exercise can promote metabolism, regulate hor-
mone equilibrium, improve cognitive function, and is a recommended factor in controlling
cardiovascular disease. Improving systemic circulation, increasing cardiopulmonary func-
tion, increasing coronary artery perfusion, and improving cardiac stress tolerance are all
effects of regular exercise [ 13,14]. Physical exercise can lead to an increase in ventricular
dimensions and myocardial mass, and it can increase both cardiac output and stroke vol-
ume [ 15]. Exercise training and its effects on myocardial ischemia (MI) were ﬁrst reported
in a study by McElroy et al. [ 16]. Their study found that exercising could reduce the infarct
size after MI due to it inducing the formation of new blood vessels in rat hearts [ 16]. For
animals, the most commonly employed interventional exercising methods are running
on a treadmill and swimming. Studies showed that treadmill training in rats increases
antioxidant enzyme levels and improves blood-pumping capacity recovery following
MI [17].
Regular physical exercise can lead to an increase in antioxidant enzyme levels in
muscles [ 18]. Exposure to cold, whether the medium is cold air or water, is a signiﬁcant
environmental stressor. Since cold mediums trigger many different responses in living
organisms, both thermoregulatory and chemical, cold stimulation is used as a form of
physical therapy [ 19]. Following up on the last statement, water immersion is a popular
recovery method, especially after long and hard training sessions. It is most commonly
used by athletes for reducing muscle pain or accelerating fatigued muscles’ recovery, but
it is not limited to them since it is also recommended for older people to modify their
lifestyles [ 20]. Exposure to different temperatures and hydrostatic pressure are the factors
responsible for triggering various physiological changes. Exercising in cold environments
has provided signiﬁcant evidence of increased usage of body fat as a more prominent energy
source and an increased VO 2demand with both immediate and long-term physiological
and biochemical consequences [ 21]. During immersion in cold water, a decrease in the
skin, subcutaneous, muscle, and sometimes even rectal temperature results from increased
metabolism and oxygen usage to maintain adequate temperatures of vital organs [ 22].
While the effects of acute and regular exercise on oxidative stress and antioxidant systems
were investigated in several studies, only a few have conﬁrmed that swimming increases
Medicina 2023 ,59, 1995 3 of 16
oxidative stress in humans and that periodical immersion in cold water could be used to
improve immune system responses and antioxidant protection [23].
Studies show that swimming training, especially before MI, can increase cardiac
antioxidant capacity in rats and improve their systolic function [ 23,24]. Increased cardiac
arteriole density and improved cardiac function during the remodeling phase were also
reported as an effect of swimming preconditioning in rats [24].
Also, using the Langendorff technique allows for the induction of ischemia, arrhyth-
mia, and hypoxia to various degrees, which makes it a unique tool for the study of patho-
logical cardiac conditions. This model provides for testing the different procedures that
change the myocardial function and provides for comparison with the intact function of
the working myocardium and the coronary vessels to obtain conclusions based on the
measurement of a variety of parameters [25].
This study aimed to examine the inﬂuence of different training modalities, such as
swimming and running, as physiological preconditioning for the prevention of isolated
rat heart ischemia/reperfusion injury. Also, this study looks to answer questions on how
different modalities of physical training (aerobic and anaerobic training) and intensity
(moderate and high intensity) could impact the prevention or reduction of functional heart
damage after ischemia.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Ethical Concerns
This experimental study was approved by the Ethics Committee for the Welfare of experi-
mental animals, Faculty of Medical Sciences, University of Kragujevac, (No. 01-10540/3). All
procedures followed the Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (GLP).
According to these guidelines, we followed all procedures that reduced suffering for the
animals during laboratory testing: reduced number of animals needed in a procedure;
reﬁned procedures to cause the least possible distress to the animals; acclimatized the
animals to new environments; well-trained staff; positive reinforcements; and helpful tools
(analgesics, anesthetics, and non-pharmacological strategies) [26].
2.2. Experimental Animals
This study was conducted on 60 male Wistar albino rats (6 weeks old, with an average
body weight of 200 20 g). Their habitat in the Institute of Cardiovascular Physiology con-
sisted of strictly controlled environmental conditions such as consistent room temperature
(222C) with established day/night cycles lasting 12 h and an abundance of food and
water to be taken freely (ad libitum). The Wistar outbred albino rat is the most popular rat
model due to its multi-purpose characteristics, productive performances, and cost beneﬁts,
making it a powerful species for clinical medical research in physiology and long studies.
The animals (n = 60) used in this study were healthy and not under the effects of drugs
or supplements. They were randomly divided into three experimental groups (12 animals
per group):
1. CTRL group—a sedentary control group of rats that were not exposed to physical training;
2. sAeT—a group that underwent aerobic swimming conditioning using a swimming
protocol for 8 weeks;
3. sAnT—a group that underwent anaerobic swimming conditioning for 8 weeks;
4. rAeT—a group that underwent aerobic running conditioning using a running protocol
for 8 weeks;
5. rAnT—a group that underwent anaerobic running conditioning using a running
protocol for 8 weeks.
2.3. Aerobic and Anaerobic Swimming Protocol
The swimming protocols were conducted in a specially constructed glass tank
(80 cm 60 cm 100 cm) with an installed electric heater used for maintaining wa-
ter temperature (37 1C) and a pump for continuously making waves to prevent ﬂoating
Medicina 2023 ,59, 1995 4 of 16
instead of swimming. The animals were under supervision during the entire duration of
the exercises. The training protocol began every day early in the morning (9:00 a.m.) for
all training sessions. Simultaneously, a maximum of six (6) rats were placed in the water
tank [27,28].
In the aerobic swimming protocol (AeS), the corresponding group was swimming for
ﬁve (5) days per week for nine (9) weeks continuously. The ﬁrst week of the protocol was
an adaptation period with the animals continuously swimming for 20 min on the ﬁrst day,
with the swimming time increasing by 10 min daily and ending with a 60 min swimming
session on the ﬁfth day. The exercise duration was constant from the second week onwards
(60 min/day, 5 days/week), with no additional weight added, so the required level of
physical exercise was just below the recommended anaerobic level [28,29].
To conﬁrm that we reached an anaerobic level of lactates, we used the following
swimming protocol (ArS). The anaerobic threshold of lactate was set at 4.5 mmol/L, and
all values below 3.5 mmol/L were set as aerobic.
The protocol consisted of swimming for 60 min daily for ﬁve (5) days per week during
the ﬁrst two weeks as an adaptation period. The following three weeks consisted of 15 min
swimming sessions where each animal was equipped with lead weights corresponding
to 6.5% of their weight. During the last four weeks of the protocol, the rats underwent
60 min swimming sessions again equipped with lead weights corresponding to 6.5% of
their body weight. At the end of each week of training, we measured the lactate levels
in exercising rats via tail vein punction using a portable lactate monitor and a lancet. To
simulate the same stress levels that our exercising groups of animals had, the rats from the
control group were also put in water for 1 min per day/5 days a week until the end of the
training period [27].
2.4. Swimming Pool for Experimental Animals
Swim-training was performed in a glass pool (60 cm 100 cm 75 cm), with the
water depth 60 cm and the temperature of the aquatic environment 37 1C. Training
was performed by two groups simultaneously with continuous monitoring of the training
and the temperature of water environment. In order to experience the same experimental
conditions, rats from CTRL group were placed into a separate water tank (depth 5 cm) for
ﬁve minutes at the same water temperature [28].
2.5. Aerobic and Anaerobic Running Protocol
After the adaptation period, rats subjected to moderate intensity running would run
60 min a day for the next ﬁve weeks, gradually increasing the running speed (10–13 m/min)
so that in the last week the rats ran at a speed of 15 m/min [ 26,27]. The total duration of
this protocol is 6 weeks including adaptation period.
High Intensity Interval Training Protocol (High Intensity Interval Running) means
that after the adaptation period, rats subjected to high-intensity interval running would
run at an intensity of 45 m/min for 30 s from the second week, and after a 3 min rest, this
procedure would be repeated in four more cycles. During the next three weeks, both the
speed and the duration of running was gradually increased so that in the last week, the
rats would run at a speed of 55 m/min for 90 s in ﬁve cycles [ 27]. In order to evaluate and
conﬁrm the aerobic or anaerobic type of running in animals from both groups, lactates
were measured after each running session (at least three times a week) using a commercial
lactometer by puncturing the tail vein [27].
2.6. Treadmill for Small Experimental Animals
Exercise protocol was performed by Treadmill for rats (ELUNIT Medical Equipment),
customized for anatomical and physiological characteristics of small experimental animals
(power supply 220 V , 50 Hz; number of trails for running: 4; speed control 2–50 m/min with
a resolution of 0.1 m/min; bars which deliver mild electric shock of 0–0.5 mA with a 1–2 s
interpulse interval), connected with Treadmill software (animal treadmill for rats—TM
Medicina 2023 ,59, 1995 5 of 16
S01) to monitor speed continuously. Mild electric shock was activated when rats stopped
running but without causing stress to animals [29,30].
2.7. Ex Vivo Estimating Myocardical Function of Wistar Rats
We excised and then perfused the hearts of all the exercising animals (n = 60, 12 in
each experimental group) on Langendorff apparatus (Experimetria Ltd., 1062 Budapest,
Hungary) [ 25,31]. After a brief anesthetization period using ketamine (10 mg/kg) and
xylazine (5 mg/kg), cervical dislocation was performed and the animals were sacriﬁced
(Schedule 1 of the Animals/Scientiﬁc Procedures, Act 1986, UK). After the ensuing midline
thoracotomy, the hearts were extracted and dipped in cold isotonic saline before being
mounted on the Langendorff apparatus for retrograde perfusion under constant coronary
perfusion pressure (CPP of 70 cmH 2O). For the perfusion the Krebs–Henseleit buffer was
used (in mmol/L: NaCl 118, KCl 4.7, CaCl 22H2O 2.5, MgSO 47H2O 1.7, NaHCO 3,
KH 2PO41.2, glucose 11, and pyruvate 2). The buffer was then warmed up to 37C while
maintaining a pH of 7.4 and infused with 95% O 2and 5% CO 2. After the successful mount,
a stabilization period of circa 20 min at CPP of 70 cm H 2O transpired, after which a 30 min
global ischemia session ensued. Following the ischemia session, a 30 min reperfusion
period started. Different parameters [ 25] for assessing myocardial function were measured
with a sensor placed in the left heart ventricle:
1. Maximum rate of pressure development in LV (dp/dt max);
2. Minimum rates of pressure development in LV (dp/dt min);
3. Systolic left ventricle pressure (SLVP);
4. Diastolic left ventricle pressure (DLVP);
5. Heart rate (HR);
6. Coronary ﬂow (CF) was measured ﬂowmetrically.
2.8. Statistical Analysis
Values are expressed as the mean standard error of mean. The well-known Shapiro–
Wilk test was the method used to test the normality of the data. For testing the differences
between groups in each parameter, one-way ANOVA and Tukey post hoc test were used
to conﬁrm the differences. Normality tests and analytical tests were conducted using the
statistical software SPSS version 26. The statistical signiﬁcance threshold was set at 0.05.
3. Results
In Figures 1–6 the dynamics of the parameters of myocardial function measured in
ex vivo conditions are shown. The main parameters of heart contractility, dp/dt max, and
dp/dt min are signiﬁcantly changed in comparison with the CTRL values. At the beginning
of the reperfusion period (R1–R15), the dp/dt max was increased in the sAnT group, and
later increased in the sAeT group in comparison with the CTRL (Figure 1A). On the other
hand, the dp/dt max with the running protocol was signiﬁcantly decreased in the rAnT
group in comparison with the aerobic running and sedentary groups of animals (Figure 1B).
From Table 1 we can observe that in most of the measured points, the changes to the dp/dt
max in both the swimming and running protocols were altered in comparison with the
control conditions (Table 1).
Further, the second parameter of heart contractility, named dp/dt min, was also sig-
niﬁcantly altered during different types and intensities of training. That means that during
swimming, the dp/dt min in the R period was similarly increased in both groups (sAeT
and sAnT) and during running, the aerobic protocol induced an increased contractility
(Figure 2 and Table 2).

4. Discussion
This experimentally designed study, using in vivo and ex vivo conditions, was aimed
at examining the inﬂuence of different training modalities, such as swimming and running,
as physiological preconditioning methods on rat heart ischemia/reperfusion injury. In
addition, this preclinical research provided an answer to questions about how different
intensities and types of physical training (aerobic/anaerobic or swimming/running) could
improve function or reduce heart dysfunction after myocardial ischemia.
Our preclinical research was conducted on 60 male adult non-obese Wistar albino rats
which are conﬁrmed to be good and reliable models for testing the exercise protocols on
the cardiovascular system.
Animal models of acute and chronic exercise are commonly used in research. Often
the acute exercise test is used in various combinations, such as genetic, pharmacological,
and other manipulations. All the combined protocols could provide a signiﬁcant result in
the cardiovascular response to exercise and detect changes in cardiovascular function that
may not be evident at rest [ 25,31]. On the other hand, chronic exercise conditioning models
are used to study the cardiac phenotypic response to regular exercise protocols and may
provide information on novel pathways mediating cardiovascular health [ 31].Although
most of the benefits of exercise on the cardiovascular system are known, the exact mechanism
by which aerobic and anaerobic training could improve myocardial function is still unclear. In
this sense, our training models, both swimming and running in a chronic way , represent the
gold standard in evaluating the effects of exercises on the cardiovascular system.
4.1. Swimming vs. Running: The Effects on Heart Function and Cardiovascular Health
This unsurpassed question about the comparison of swimming and running in terms
of beneﬁts is actually still current. It is most important to ﬁnd the right type of physical
activity that will achieve the best ﬁtness goals and promote health. Currently, the most
popular aerobic physical activities are running and swimming. Whatever the personal
goals, both of them promote conditioning, losing weight, improving cardiovascular health,
burning calories, gaining muscle, and improving bone density [ 32]. In addition, swimming
could burn more calories in comparison with running the same distance. Swimming
is a complete body workout, which results in burning more calories compared to other
activities. Also, the risk of injury is different, and swimming is the type of training that
people with problems with joint function can undertake because it has a low impact on
joints. With running, most injuries can be prevented, but most of the problems come from
frequent pain and soft tissue injuries.
On a molecular level, aerobic metabolism generates more adenosine three phosphate
(ATP) and relies more on oxygen, while anaerobic metabolism does not need oxygen but
creates two ATP molecules per one molecule of glucose. In addition, both types of activity
need to produce cellular energy [32].
In our study, we conﬁrmed the differences between the effects of the type of activity on
changing the myocardial contractility after a long period (8 weeks) of preconditioning. For
estimating the main course of cardiac contractility, the most important are the parameters
Medicina 2023 ,59, 1995 13 of 16
of maximum and minimum rate of development of left ventricular pressure and systolic
pressure (dp/dt max, dp/dt min, and SLVP).
In Figures 1–6 the dynamics of the parameters of myocardial function measured in
ex vivo conditions are shown. The main parameters of heart contractility, dp/dt max,
and dp/dt min are signiﬁcantly changed in comparison with the CTRL values. In the
beginning of the reperfusion period (R1–R15), the dp/dt max was increased in the sAnT
group, but also later increased in the sAeT group in comparison with the CTRL (Figure 1A).
On the other hand, the dp/dt max when using the running protocol was signiﬁcantly
decreased in the rAnT group in comparison with the aerobic running and sedentary groups
of animals (Figure 1B). From Table 1 we can observe that in most of the measured points,
the changes to the dp/dt max with the swimming and running protocols were altered
in comparison with the control conditions (Table 1). Further, the second parameter of
heart contractility, named as dp/dt min, was also signiﬁcantly altered during the different
types and intensities of training. That means that during swimming, the dp/dt min in the
R period was similarly increased in both groups (sAeT and sAnT) and during running,
the aerobic protocol induced more increased contractility (Figure 2 and Table 2). Systolic
left ventricular pressure was signiﬁcantly increased during the anaerobic protocol for
swimming, and during the anaerobic protocol for running. Both protocols, aerobic and
anaerobic, induced an elevation of SLVP in both types of training (Figure 3 and Table 3).
Deﬁnitely, the aerobic modality of training when both swimming and running have shown
the ability of improving cardiac function and reducing reperfusion injury after global
ischemia in an animal model. The differences in the effects of anaerobic and aerobic activity
in our results can be explained by the well-known fact that in cells, aerobic respiration
occurs within the mitochondria and anaerobic respiration occurs in the cytoplasm of a
cell [ 33,34]. This evidence is also in accordance with previous studies, which conﬁrmed
the heart hypertrophy induced by physical activity. After a century of experimental and
clinical investigations, exercise-induced cardiac hypertrophy is a result of training improved
contractility and that is an expected adaptation of regular physical training [35–37].
Baptista et al. evaluated the effects of treadmill running and swimming in rats [ 38].
Their study was performed on the normal Wister rat to evaluate the effects of two distinct
moderate/long-term aerobic training protocols, treadmill running and the swimming, on
several important parameters related to cardiovascular (CV) physiological adaptations,
namely: lipid proﬁle, hemorheological measures, lipid peroxidation, peripheral seroton-
ergic system (SS) modulation, and sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activation. In both
groups of training, an HDL-c increment versus the sedentary control was demonstrated.
There was a noticeable increase in ADP-induced platelet aggregation in the exercised rats,
together with higher PDW and MPV values. They concluded that treadmill running was
more inﬂuential than swimming when concerned with peripheral SS modulation, while
swimming was more important on SNS activation, thus recommending a judicious choice
of the protocol to be tested in works which make use of rat models of exercise to study
physiological or pathophysiological conditions [ 39]. Similar to these conclusions, our re-
sults conﬁrmed that running induced more intensive improvement in cardiac contractility
in comparison with the swimming.
The mechanism for inducing these adaptations remains unknown, but it could be
due to the hypoxic environment when swimming [ 37,39]. In contrast, endurance running
programs involving rodents (as well as other species) suggest relatively little change in
the biochemical and functional properties of the contractile system [ 39]. In addition to
that, a great advantage of this modality is that the exercise training requires only minimal
investigator intervention and does not require aversive stimuli (e.g., electric shocks or air
jets) to motivate the animals to run in the wheels.
4.2. Aerobic vs. Anaerobic Exercise: The Effects on Heart Function and Cardiovascular Health
Both aerobic and anaerobic exercise are important for optimal health. As previously
mentioned, aerobic metabolism, known as “cardio”, generates more adenosine three phos-
Medicina 2023 ,59, 1995 14 of 16
phate (ATP) and relies more on oxygen, while anaerobic metabolism does not need oxygen
but creates two ATP molecules per one molecule of glucose [ 32]. The optimization of the
physiological mechanisms of exercise and their subsequent impact on cardiovascular health
remains a subject of ongoing uncertainty, both in animal models and clinical practice.. Good
models of exercise testing are animal studies. In most cases, animal-based cardiovascular
exercise modalities include treadmill running, swimming, and voluntary wheel running
with a series of intensities, times, and durations [ 38–41]. Those using animals include small
rodents (e.g., mice and rats) and large animals (e.g., rabbits, dogs, goats, sheep, pigs, and
horses). Depending on the research goal, each experimental protocol should also describe
whether its respective exercise treatment can produce the anticipated acute or chronic
cardiovascular adaptive response [38,40].
Kent et al. [ 42] presented multiple lines of cardiovascular discovery using exercise
models that were initiated in animals as the fundamental step for designing and testing
explicit hypotheses in humans. One of those types is our study.
In our study, we evaluated the differences in the aerobic and anaerobic physical
training in both modalities, swimming and running, in relation to the preconditioning
of heart function. We conﬁrmed that the anaerobic running protocol strongly induces an
increased contractility in rat hearts (increasing the dp/dt max and dp/dt min), while the
aerobic swimming protocol was more powerful in comparison with the aerobic running
(Figures 1–6). Our report is a good way to present an overall picture of scientiﬁc research
studies using animal models with a focus on the different training modalities that we
examined. One thing is certain, the tested groups exhibit varying exercise capacities and
maximum oxygen uptake, leading to divergent results in cardiac contractility.. Geenen
and colleagues compared aerobic training to anaerobic training and found that multiple
training-induced cardiovascular and hormonal adaptations produced in the rat differed
signiﬁcantly [ 39,42]. Anaerobic training (HIIT) increased maximal exercise performance
and reduced the blood lactate responses more compared with free-wheel or aerobic running.
These differential cardiovascular, skeletal muscle, and metabolic training responses across
the three exercise modalities should be considered carefully, especially in comparison to
the aerobic protocols of swimming and running.
Very interestingly, heart rate was signiﬁcantly reduced in both swimming training
groups after the ischemia period. On the other hand, the anaerobic running protocol caused
a signiﬁcant decrease in heart rate compared to the aerobic running and sedentary groups
(Figure 5, Table 5). Finally, with the coronary circulation parameter—coronary ﬂow—we
measured the ﬂow metrically and for each point manually. We observed that the anaerobic
swimming training caused a decrease in heart rate in the R period compared to the aerobic
and control groups. On the contrary, running both aerobically and anaerobically caused a
significant decrease in heart rate during the R period compared to the CTRL group (Figure 6,
Table 6).
These interesting results (that anaerobic running training decreased heart rate and
anaerobic swimming training reduced coronary ﬂow) occur due to all the previously
mentioned differences in the physiological heart response to aerobic/anaerobic physical
training [37–41,43].
5. Conclusions
All data from this experimental study support many training effects: improved con-
tractility, resting heart rate, and increased physical work capacity and exercise tolerance.
Anaerobic running physical training induces greater heart preconditioning to reperfusion
injury in comparison with anaerobic swimming training. The physiological response with
aerobic swimming physical training is more valuable for improving exercise tolerance
and coronary circulation. Future directions for testing the preconditions strategies will be
focused on testing the effects of adjuvant antioxidant agents in combination with different
physical training protocols.
