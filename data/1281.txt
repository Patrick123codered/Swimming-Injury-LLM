ABSTRACT:   
Background: Swimmers have a significant potential for shoulder injuries due to the unique nature 
of the different styles involved in swimming, as well as the high volume of repetitions required 
during training, which arise through repetitive strain and microtrauma. Injuries are the most fre-
quent due to the repetitive use of the upper limb in overhead movements and factors related to 
Range of Motion (ROM) and strength . Objective: To analyze the performance of the shoulder of 
swimming  athletes and to verify if there is a difference between athletes with and without a history 
of injury, as well as to verify the transmission between the performance of this joint with ROM and 
strength values . Methods: 24 competitive swimmers were evaluate d, with an average age of 20 
years (± 7.9). The glenohumeral internal rotation deficit (GIRD) and internal and external rotation 
ROM of the shoulder were evaluated using goniometry. Shoulder functionality was assessed using 
the closed kinetic chain test fo r upper limbs (CKCUEST). Handgrip strength was also evaluated 
with a dynamometer. SPSS software, version 21.0, was used and data were analyzed using Pear-
son's collaboration test and Student's t test for independent samples . Results: Athletes with a his-
tory of injuries had a higher weekly training load, although they did not differ in terms of the 
number of years practicing the sport. The performance in the CKCUEST was higher in the group 
without a history of injury (p=0.04) and there was no difference betwe en the groups regarding the 
variables of total ROM and GIRD, as well as for grip strength. There was change only between the 
CKCUEST power values with the grip strength (p<0.05, r=0.677).  Conclusion: The functional per-
formance of the shoulder is greater in  athletes without a history of injury.

BACKGROUND  
 Swimming is an overhead sport, that is, it uses movements above the head, 
requiring mainly the upper part of the body for propulsive force, with 90% of the 
driving force provided mainly by the torque generated by the shoulder. To compete at 
an elite level, each swimmer must cover between 60,000 and 80,000 meters per week, 
equivalent to 30,000 strokes per upper limb (1). Swimmers have a significant potential 
for shoulder injuries due to the unique nature of the different styles involved in 
swimming, as well as the high volume of repetitions required during training, which 
arise through repetitive strain and microtrauma(2 -4). 
 Among the ma in injuries in the sport, the most recurrent are rotator cuff 
tendinopathies, impingement syndrome, labral injuries, and instability secondary to 
ligament laxity or muscle imbalance that results in a decrease in the athlete's 
performance(5 -7). Injuries in sports can be considered the main factor in athletes leaving 
their sport. This absence is harmful, as it directly influences their physical and technical 
performance, in addition to possible psychological damage, with changes in cognitive, 
behavioral, and affective responses(8,9).  Corresponding author:  Cristiane

Analysis of shoulder performance in athletes  Soares , IC et al.

  Since one of the main risk factors is due to the repetitive use of the upper limb in 
overhead movements and factors related to range of motion (ROM) and strength, it is 
clinically important to use practical methods for analysis and evaluation constant of the 
athlete to prevent injuries and criteria for returning to sport after absence(10).  
 A widely used instrument for analyzing shoulder functional performance is the 
closed kinetic chain test for upper limbs, also known as the Closed Kinetic Chain Upper 
Extremity Stability Test (CKCUEST), as it is a validated, simple to apply and low -cost 
test that can be easily inserted into the clinical or sporting context and which has a good 
correlation with measures of muscular stren gth, in addition to showing excellent 
reliability(11).  
 Handgrip strength has been used as an indicator of the body's general muscular 
strength, is significantly associated with other muscles' functioning and the upper limb's 
function, and is even consider ed a biomarker(12,13). In the context of sport, grip 
strength is important to optimize performance and potentially prevent injuries (14).  
In overhead sports, it is common to observe a reduction in the internal rotation ROM of 
the dominant upper limb when c ompared to the non -dominant limb, verified based on 
the assessment of the glenohumeral internal rotation deficit or the Glenohumeral 
Internal Rotation Deficit (GIRD). This clinical condition is closely related to an important 
risk factor for chronic pain a nd injuries to the shoulder joint(15 -17). 
 This study aimed to analyze the shoulder performance of swimming athletes and 
verify whether there was a difference between athletes with and without a history of 
injury, as well as verify the relationship between  the performance of this joint with ROM 
and strength parameters. The study hypothesis was that athletes with a history of 
shoulder involvement would present lower performance during the functional test.  
METHODS  
 The study was approved by the Research Ethic s Committee of the Faculty of 
Philosophy and Sciences of UNESP Marília, under protocol nº 1 .841.672, and carried out 
by the standards of the National Health Council. Anamnesis was carried out and data on 
age, body mass (in kilograms), height (in meters), b ody mass index (BMI), hours of 
weekly training, and history of shoulder joint injury. Competitive male swimming 
athletes aged between 18 and 30 years were included in the study. As non -inclusion 
criteria, positive Cozen and Phalen tests were adopted, which  could interfere with 
strength and performance results(18).  
 To perform internal and external rotation goniometry of the athlete's shoulder, a 
universal goniometer (Arktus®, São Paulo, Brazil) was used. The athlete was positioned 
in the supine position, wi th 90 degrees of shoulder abduction and 90 degrees of elbow 
flexion to ensure stabilization of the scapula and trunk. The goniometer was positioned 
with the fixed arm perpendicular to the floor, the axis positioned on the olecranon and 
the movable arm posi tioned along the forearm with the styloid process of the ulna as a 
reference point and following the rotational movements. Passive internal and external 
rotation movements of the glenohumeral joint and three range of motion measurements 
were performed(19,2 0). Internal and external rotation ROM was analyzed bilaterally to 
evaluate GIRD, as can be seen in Figure 01.

 To analyze handgrip strength, a hand -held hydraulic dynamome ter (JAMAR®, 
TBW Importadora LTDA, São Paulo, Brazil) was used. The volunteer was positioned 
seated, with feet flat on the ground, with elbow flexion at 90 degrees, forearm in a 
neutral position, with the wrist varying from 0 to 30 degrees of extension and  ulnar 
deviation from 0 to 15 degrees. The dynamometer was positioned with the reader facing 
the evaluator. An attempt was made to familiarize the test, followed by three valid 
repetitions of maximal isometric contraction with a 60 -second interval between them. 
 The average value of the attempts was calculated in kilogram -force (Kgf)(21).  
To carry out the athlete's shoulder performance test, the CKCUEST was performed 
based on the protocol by Goldback and Davies (2000), where two 3.8cm tapes were 
positioned  parallel to the floor with a distance of 91.44cm between them. The volunteers 
were instructed to stay in the “push -up” position with their hands on the tapes, as can 
be seen in Figure 2. After the examiner's command, the volunteer removed the palm and 
placed it on the back of the contralateral hand in Then he returned to the starting 
position and performed the same movement with the other side(22).  
Figure 02:  Positioning to perform the CKCUEST.  
 Two examiners performed the CKCUES test. The first examiner c ounted the 
number of touches made by the participants. The second examiner was responsible for 
checking the digital timer and verbally informing the first examiner and the participant 
of the start and end times of the test. The test was performed four time s for 15 seconds 
with 45 seconds of rest between each repetition, the first being familiarization, trying to 
give as many touches as possible within the estimated time. The average of the three 
maximum tests was then obtained and the volunteers' test score s were calculated. 
Athletes' performance was measured using the formula: average number of 
touches/height in inches; and the power according to the formula: 68% of the weight in 
kilograms x average number of touches / 15(23).

 Statistical analysis  
 The convenience sample was used. All analyses were performed using SPSS 
version 21 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Normal distribution was verified using the 
Shapiro -Wilk test. The Student's t -test for independent samples was performed to verify 
the difference  between swimming athletes with and without a history of injury about 
anthropometric variables, time in the sport, range of movement, and shoulder 
performance in the closed chain test. Then, the Pearson correlation test was calculated to 
evaluate the assoc iation between CKCUEST, GIRD, and strength values. A significance 
level of 0.05 was considered . 
RESULTS  
 24 competitive swimming athletes, with an average age of 20 years (± 7.9), of 
competitive level, were evaluated, divided into two groups: with a history of injury 
(n=10) and without a history of injury (n=14). Table 01 shows the values found about 
age, anthropometric data, and physical activity of the research volunteers. It was 
possible to observe that the sample was homogeneous about the variable s, showing a 
significant difference (p<0.05) only in the hours of weekly training.

 Table 02 shows the performance values in the CKCUEST, internal rotation deficit, 
and hand grip strength for both groups. It can be seen that the values of CKCUTEST 
were statistically significant between the groups in terms of the number of touches and 
the mean. However, there was no significant difference about the GIRD score and grip 
strength. The Pearson correlation test demonstrated that the re was only a positive and 
moderate correlation between the power values of the CKCUTEST test and grip 
strength. However, there was no correlation between the CKCUTEST values and the 
GIRD, as can be seen in Table 03.

DISCUSSION  
The present study aimed to analyze the performance and ROM of the shoulder 
joint of swimming athletes and verify whether there is a difference between athletes 
with and without a history of injury, partially confirming the initial hypothesis. 
CKCUTEST values were significantly higher in the group without a history of inj ury in 
terms of the number and average of touches. This finding corroborates the work of Tucci 
and collaborators, who evaluated performance in the CKCUEST in people with and 
without shoulder impingement syndrome, demonstrating that individuals with a 
histo ry of injury obtained inferior results compared to healthy individuals(24). A 
possible justification could be that the CKCUEST is a high -level performance test, which 
requires an exacerbated demand on the shoulder joint, and its results may be limited by 
kinesiophobia and pain when performing the movements.  
On the other hand, the findings of the present study showed no significant 
difference in GIRD values between the groups. Swimming's main sporting gesture is 
movements performed bilaterally above the head . Therefore, one hypothesis for the 
findings would be that the internal rotation deficit would also occur bilaterally since 
GIRD values in swimming athletes are lower when compared to other types of overhead 
athletes(25).  
About weekly training time, athlet es in the group with a history of injury had a 
statistically greater training volume compared to the group without injury. Ristolainen 
and collaborators demonstrated through a retrospective study of  
12 months with 154 adolescent and adult swimmers, injured  swimmers reported 
swimming more than uninjured swimmers, with 1612 kilometers and 1380 kilometers, 
respectively (p= 0.04)(26).  
In this study, it was possible to observe a positive correlation between power 
values in the CKCUEST and handgrip strength. Hand grip is closely related to the 
function of the upper extremity and is an action that facilitates rotator cuff movements. 
Similar results were found in the study by Lee et al., which demonstrated high positive 
correlations for both the right hand (0.79) and  the left hand (0.78)(27).  
This study did not evaluate the methods that were used to treat athletes with a 
history of injury, as well as the type of injury suffered, which could contribute to a better 
understanding of their impact on the performance of the  athletes evaluated. The 
limitations of the present study also include the sample size and future studies should 
be conducted on a larger population, as well as monitoring the types of injuries suffered 
and the treatment methods used at the time of the tra uma .

 CONCLUSION  
The present study demonstrated that swimming athletes without a history of 
shoulder injury have a greater closed kinetic chain functional performance compared to 
swimmers with a history of injury. Regarding ROM and strength parameters, ther e was 
no significant difference between the groups .
