Abstract
Restoration of lost function following a nervous system injury is limited in adulthood as the regenerative ca-
pacity of nervous system declines with age. Pharmacological approaches have not been very successful in al-
leviating the consequences of nervous system injury. On the contrary, physical activity and rehabilitation
interventions are often beneficial to improve the health conditions in the patients with neuronal injuries. Usingtouch neuron circuit of Caenorhabditis elegans , we investigated the role of physical exercise in the improve-
ment of functional restoration after axotomy. We found that a swimming session of 90 min following the axoto-
my of posterior lateral microtubule (PLM) neuron can improve functional recovery in larval and adult stageanimals. In older age, multiple exercise sessions were required to enhance the functional recovery. Genetic
analysis of axon regeneration mutants showed that exercise-mediated enhancement of functional recovery de-
pends on the ability of axon to regenerate. Exercise promotes early initiation of regrowth, self-fusion of proxi-mal and distal ends, as well as postregrowth enhancement of function. We further found that the swimming
exercise promotes axon regeneration through the activity of cellular energy sensor AAK-2/AMPK in both mus-
cle and neuron. Our study established a paradigm where systemic effects of exercise on functional regenera-tion could be addressed at the single neuron level.

Significance Statement
Accelerating axonal regeneration and subsequent functional restoration is a major challenge to the people
with nervous system injury. Research on rodents and humans suggests that rehabilitation therapy helps re-
gain the lost function after neuronal injury. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans provides an advantage to
investigate the role of exercise in facilitating the axonal regeneration at the level of single neuron. Our studyshows that swimming exercise promotes functional restoration via structural and functional changes in in-
jured mechanosensory neuron. The benefit of exercise in regeneration depends on the metabolic energy
sensor AAK-2/AMPK. This study provides a molecular perspective to exercise-mediated enhancement ofaxon regeneration.
Introduction
Neuronal injuries are accompanied by physical disrup-
tion of the axons, which leads to the loss of sensory ormotor function ( Johnson et al., 2013 ;Yang et al., 2015 ).CNS has limited capacity to regenerate because of intrin-
sic failure and several inhibitory factors in the environment(Huebner and Strittmatter, 2009 ;He and Jin, 2016 ;van
Niekerk et al., 2016 ). In case of peripheral nervous

system, regeneration from the injured proximal stump and
subsequent growth toward the target tissues can lead tofunctional restoration ( He and Jin, 2016 ;Laha et al.,
2017 ). However, this capability declines with age, result-
ing in partial or no functional restoration ( Verdú et al.,
2000 ;Geoffroy et al., 2016 ;Abay et al., 2017 ;Basu et al.,
2017 ). Indeed, intrinsic capacity of axonal regrowth de-
clines with age ( Verdú et al., 2000 ) and external microen-
vironment poses various challenges in long distance axonregrowth ( Brosius Lutz and Barres, 2014 ).
Although there is comprehensive understanding of
axon regeneration pathways ( He and Jin, 2016 ;Mahar
and Cavalli, 2018 ;Richardson and Shen, 2019 ), protective
measures against aging-related loss of regenerative po-tential are rather lacking. On the contrary, accumulatingevidences suggest a beneficial role of rehabilitation thera-pies and physical exercise in promoting functional recov-ery following spinal cord and other injuries in human ( van
Hedel and Dietz, 2010 ;Formento et al., 2018 ). Physical
exercise enhances functional restoration after nervoussystem injury in primates and rat models as well(Capogrosso et al., 2016 ;Fu et al., 2016 ). Electrical stimu-
lation and modulation of central pattern generator leads
to dramatic increase in locomotor activity in humans and
rats after spinal cord lesion ( Wagner et al., 2018 ). The
benefit of exercise is accompanied by remodeling of vari-ous parts of brain ( Karssemeijer et al., 2017 ;Horowitz et
al., 2020 ). Although many evidence suggest that exercise
promotes regrowth of injured axon in peripheral system(Park and Höke, 2014 ;Gordon and English, 2016 ;Chen et
al., 2017b ), it is not completely clear whether functional
improvement is the outcome of rewiring of injured axon orremodeling of spared circuitry. Also, cellular and molecu-lar mechanisms involving exercise-mediated functionalimprovement after nerve injury are not clear.
Caenorhabditis elegans is an excellent model to investi-
gate the cellular and molecular mechanism of axon regen-eration following laser-assisted injury ( Hammarlund et al.,
2009 ;He and Jin, 2016 ;Richardson and Shen, 2019 ).
Axonal injury leads to calcium influx and activates theconserved p38-MAPK pathway involving dual leucine zip-per kinase (DLK)-1, which initiates the transcription of re-generation associated genes ( Hammarlund et al., 2009 ;Ghosh-Roy et al., 2010 ;Nix et al., 2011 ). Several molecu-
lar pathways controlling axon regrowth potential are iden-tified using mechanosensory and motor neurons asmodel systems ( Byrne and Hammarlund, 2017 ;Hisamoto
and Matsumoto, 2017 ). The two posterior lateral microtu-
bule (PLM) neurons and the DA9 motor neurons allowedcorrelating functional restoration with axon regrowth at thesingle neuron level ( Abay et al., 2017 ;Basu et al., 2017 ;
Ding and Hammarlund, 2018 ). However, it has not been
tested whether physical exercise would promote axon re-generation and functional recovery. In C. elegans , a single
or multiple swimming sessions show exercise-like features(Laranjeiro et al., 2017 ,2019
). Swimming sessions extend
neuromuscular and gut health span, enhance learning abil-
ity, and protects against neurodegeneration ( Laranjeiro et
al., 2019 ). Exercise in an electrotactic flow chamber ameli-
orates the age-related degeneration ( Chuang et al., 2016 ).
In this study, we have investigated the role of swimming
exercise in improving functional restoration after axotomyof the PLM neurons. We found that a single swim sessionof 90 min could improve functional restoration throughaxon regeneration process regardless of age. This exer-cise regimen can also improve the age-related decline intouch response function. To understand how swimmingexercise promotes functional restoration, we imaged andcorrelated the anatomic pattern of regrowth to the recov-ery index of function. This revealed that exercise pro-motes regrowth, self-fusion events, and postregrowthfunctional recovery. Improvement in functional restorationon swimming depends on the function of the cellular en-ergy sensor AMP kinase-2/AAK-2 in both neurons and
muscle.
Materials and Methods
C. elegans strains
All the strains were grown and maintained at 20°C in
nematode growth media (NGM) under standard conditions(Brenner, 1974 ). We used the following strains: Bristol N2,
aak-2(ok524) X ,mlk-1(ok2471) V ,dlk-1(tm4024) I ,ebp-1
(tm1357) V ,a n d unc-54(r293) I . The extrachromosomal
DNA-containing strains used were aak-2 (ok524); shrEx362
(Pmec-4::aak-2 ),aak-2(ok524); shrEx364 (Pmyo-3::aak-2 ),
andaak-2(ok524); shrEX420 (Pdpy-7::aak-2 ). First, the ex-
trachromosomal arrays were obtained in Pmec-7::GFP
(muIs32) background by injecting the rescue transgenes at
10 ng/ ml. Then the transgenes were introduced into the
aak-2 mutant backgrounds by crossing. Homozygosity for
all mutations was confirmed by either PCR or sequencing.All loss of function mutations are denoted as (0).W eu s e d

containing 50 mM5-Fluoro deoxyuridine (FUDR; Sigma;
catalog #F0503; Basu et al., 2017 ). The worms at different
life stages were used for experiments.
Swimming exercise paradigm
A single swimming session is considered as acute exer-
cise paradigm in C. elegans (Laranjeiro et al., 2017 ,2019 ).
In our study, we have adopted mostly the single swim-
session paradigm for exercise after axotomy of PLM neu-rons ( Fig. 1 A;Movie 1 ). Occasionally, the worms were
subjected to multiple swim sessions ( Fig. 2 C). The worms
were subjected to swimming in M9 buffer in 96-well plate for
the duration ranging from 15 to 120 min. Single animals
were kept in wells containing 200 ml of M9 buffer (one worm
per well). After the desired duration of swimming, the ani-
mals were recovered on NGM plate. In the control group,
worms were kept in a plate without OP50 food for the same
duration and then returned to plates containing food. We
found that the ATP level is significantly dropped as reportedbefore ( Chaudhari and Kipreos, 2017 ) after a 90-min swim
session and therefore we used this 90-min session for most
of the experiments.
Measurement of ATP level after swim session
To measure the change in the ATP level following
swim exercise, we used an ATP bioluminescence assay
kit CLSII (Roche Diagnostics, catalog #11699695001;
Palikaras and Tavernarakis, 2016 ). Briefly, 60 A3 worms
from “non-swimming ”as well as the “swimming ”group
were collected in 50 ml of M9 buffer in a 1.5-ml tube. The
samples were then frozen in liquid nitrogen. The frozen
tubes were kept in boiling water for 15 min. The samples
were centrifuged at 14,800 /C2gfor 10 min at 4°C. The
supernatants were transferred to a fresh tube and di-luted tenfold by adding water before measurement. The
ATP levels were determined using Glomax luminometer
(Promega). Before measurement, 100 mlo fs a m p l eo r
ATP standard was added to 100 ml of luciferase in the
well and incubated for 10 s at room temperature andthen the luminescence was measured. The ATP level in
the worm sample was derived from the ATP standard
curve. Finally, the ATP levels were normalized with re-spect to the total protein (mg) measured through BCA
protein estimation method.
Femtosecond laser, axotomy, and imaging
For axotomy of PLM neurons, the animals were immo-
bilized using 0.1-
mm polystyrene beads on a 5% agarose
pad under a coverslip. For all the experiments, only onePLM axon corresponding to either left or right side of the
animal was axotomized at a distance of 50 –60
mm from
the cell body, as described before ( Basu et al., 2017 ). The
side corresponding to the axotomized PLM neuron is
called “cut side ”and other called the “control side. ”
Simultaneous two-photon imaging and axotomy was per-
formed according to the previous published protocol
(Basu et al., 2017 ). The PLM axon was imaged and axo-
tomized with 920- and 720-nm lasers, respectively, under
a6 0/C2(Olympus) water-immersion objective of 1.1 NA on atwo-photon microscope ( Basu et al., 2017 ). This system has
two tunable (wavelength range 690 –1040 nm), automated
depression compensated femtosecond lasers from SpectraPhysics (Mai Tai with Deepsee). The imaging was done with
a 6-mm galvanometer scanning system and axotomy was
performed with a 3-mm galvanometer system.
Gentle touch assay
Each worm was recovered after axotomy on NGM plate
and then gentle touch assay was performed. Gentle
Touch Response ( Chalfie and Sulston, 1981 ;Chalfie et al.,
1985 ;Basu et al., 2017 ) was assayed from both right and
left sides of the worm. Following the touch assay in oneside, the worm was flipped and kept for 20 min beforetouching the other side ( Basu et al., 2017 ). Ten alternative
anterior and posterior touches were given with the eye-
lash tip. The anterior touch was given to a forward-movinganimal, which in response started moving backward.When a backward moving animal was given a posterior
touch, it started moving forward in response. A positive
response was denoted as 1, and no response as 0. Thenthe posterior touch response index (PTRI) was measuredas the ratio of total number of positive response to totalnumber of touch stimuli applied (Extended Data Fig. 1-1 ,
Fig. 3 B-C) as described before ( Basu et al., 2017 ).
Correlation of functional recovery with axon
regeneration events at the level of a single worm
At 3 h after axotomy, PTRIs of both axotomized and
control (uncut) side, were denoted as the PTRI postaxoto-my. Each worm was labeled based on the side of axotomy
and kept in single plate at 20°C. After 24 h, PTRI values
from both the sides were measured and compared withthe corresponding values at the postaxotomy stages.For a given side, the Recovery Index was obtained by thefollowing formula: recovery index = PTRI
24 h/PTRI 3h
(Extended Data Fig. 1-2 ). After the behavioral test at 24 h,
the regrowth pattern of the PLM axon was scored eitherusing a Leica DM5000 fluorescent microscope at 40 /C2
magnification or a Spinning disk confocal microscope(Fig. 4 D,Fig. 5 A). Specifically, it was noted whether it was
a fusion event ( Fig. 5 C) or non-fusion event ( Fig. 5 F). For
scoring successful fusion events, we carefully evaluatedwhether the proximal end has just touched the distalcounterpart or it has successfully joined and fused withthe distal end ( Fig. 5 C). In case of casual touching, the
distal end eventually undergo degeneration, and these
events are referred as reconnection ( Fig. 5 C;Neumann
and Hilliard, 2019 ).
Imaging of axon regrowth events
At 24 h postaxotomy, for imaging of the regeneration
events, the animals were immobilized using 10 m
Mleva-
misole hydrochloride. Axonal regrowth was imaged usinga Zeiss 864 Axio-Observer Z1 microscope equipped withYokogawa CSU-XA1 spinning-disk confocal scan-headand a Photometrics Evolve EMCCD camera, the images
were taken using 63 /C2oil objective of 1.46 NA. The P mec-
7::GFP labeled PLM axon was imaged with 30% input

power of 480-nm laser. The images were acquired with
the exposure time of 300 ms with the 70% of camera gain
settings. The images were then exported as czi files and
analyzed using ImageJ software. For regrowth lengthmeasurement, simple neurite tracer plugin of ImageJ wasused . Pmec-4::mcherry::RAB-3 (tbIs227) reporter was
used to image the formation synapse-like structures dur-
ing axon regeneration. Imaging was done using a Nikon
A1 plus (Nikon corporation) confocal microscope. PLMneurons expressing muIs32 andtbIs227 reporter were si-
multaneously imaged after 24 h of axotomy. Imaging wasdone under a 60 /C2oil objective (NA = 1.4) at 1 mm slice in-
terval. Excitation power was 0.8 and 1 for 488- and 561-
nm laser, respectively. The PMT power for 488-nm chan-nel was 100 and 104 for 561-nm channel with offset valueof 20.
Each PLM neuron has a ventral branch ( Fig. 1 A, arrow-
head), which makes synapse onto the postsynaptic inter-
neuron ( Chalfie and Sulston, 1981 ;Chalfie et al., 1985 ).
This allowed us to set the dorsal-ventral axis of the worm(Fig. 5 F) while analyzing the direction of axon regrowth.
The axons that regrew up to 35 –45mm in depth in ventral
direction and extended along the ventral nerve cord were
characterized as the “ventral targeting ”event ( Fig. 5 Fc).
An accumulation of the presynaptic reporter mCherry::RAB-3 along the ventral cord ( Fig. 5 Fc, yellow arrow-
heads) was also noticed in these events. This accumula-tion pattern resembled the original chemical synapses of
PLM neurons. When the distal end intensity was promi-
nently less and showed beaded appearance, it was cate-gorized as “distal degeneration ”(Fig. 5 Fc) otherwise
categorized as “distal intact ”(Fig. 5 Fa,b).
Paralysis of the worms in swimming well
At 3 h after axotomy, the animals were treated with 5
m
Mlevamisole hydrochloride for 15 s to paralyze them.
After this brief treatment with levamisole, they wereplaced in swimming wells. We found that this brieftreatment is sufficient to perturb the swimming ( Movie 2 ;
Fig. 1 E) during the 90-min swim session. To verify whether
this brief treatment of levamisole has any effect in thegentle touch response of the animal, we performed similar
paralysis without performing axotomy and then measured
the touch response after 24 h. We found that the PTRIvalue was not affected by this brief treatment (ExtendedData Fig. 1-1 B). Therefore, we used this experimental de-
sign to test the effect of blocking the swimming on en-hancement of functional regeneration ( Fig. 1 D–F).
Measurement of thrashing frequency during
swimming
For the measurement of thrashing frequency, digital
videos of worm movements were acquired during theswimming sessions, using a Leica MC 120 HD camera.The videos were recorded for 30 s at 15 frames/s usingLAS V4.4 software in a Leica stereo microscope M165 FC
at 1.25 /C2magnification. The thrashing frequency were
measured as body bends per second using wrMTrck plu-gin of ImageJ software ( http://www.phage.dk/plugins/
wrmtrck.html ). The change in the direction of bending at the
mid-body was defined as one body bend ( Truong et al.,
2015 ). A mutant for muscle myosin unc-54 (Pulak and
Anderson, 1988 ) showed drastically reduced thrashing fre-
quency using this plugin. Thrashing frequency in unc-54 mu-
tant was 18.27 613.04 as opposed to 130.8 628.97 for wild
type. This suggests that our analysis is sensitive enough to
show the difference in swimming ability because of various
experimental conditions.
Metformin treatment on paralyzed worms
At 3 h postaxotomy, worms were first treated with 5 m
Mle-
vamisole hydrochloride solution for 15 s to cause the muscle
paralysis. The experimental swimming well had 50 m M
Metformin hydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich; catalog #PHR1084).
Therefore, the paralyzed worms were treated with Metforminduring the 90-min swim session. Concentration of Metforminwere chosen to activate AMPK/AAK-2 based on the previousreport in C. elegans (Chen et al., 2017a ).

All the statistical analyses were performed using
GraphPad Prism software version 9.0.2. For two-way
comparisons, an unpaired ttest with Welch ’s correction
was used. The median values were compared with the
Mann –Whitney Utest. Fisher ’s exact test was used for
proportions. Three or more samples were compared withANOVA (nonparametric) with a post hoc Tukey ’s multiple
comparisons test. The sample numbers ( n) presented on
each bar are the total sample value accumulated over the

Results
A single swim session after axotomy of PLM neurons
promotes functional recovery
Previous studies have indicated that physical exercise
following nervous system injury promotes axon regenera-
tion and functional recovery in various model systems
(Doyle and Roberts, 2006 ;Asensio-Pinilla et al., 2009 ;
Sachdeva et al., 2016 ;Kuwabara et al., 2018 ). To address
whether physical exercise can enhance functional resto-ration in C. elegans , we designed a swimming exercise
paradigm in conjunction with PLM axon regeneration ( Fig.
1A;Movie 1 ). A single session of swimming in C. elegans
mimics the features of mammalian exercise ( Laranjeiro et
al., 2017 ). As previously reported that there is a sharp
drop in functional recovery of gentle touch behavior after
the axotomy of PLM neuron at day-3 adult worms (A3;
Basu et al., 2017 ; Extended Data Fig. 1-1 A), we tested
whether a swim session after axotomy would enhance re-
covery. We measured the PTRI at 3 and 24 h postaxotomy
(Fig. 1 A). The extent of functional recovery was repre-
sented as the normalized PTRI at 24 h with respect to that
measured at 3 h postaxotomy, which we called “recovery
index ”(Fig. 1 B; Extended Data Fig. 1-2 ). A recovery index
value, higher than 1 is an indication of improvement of
touch response over the time after axotomy. A swimming
session of 90 min or above significantly enhanced the re-
covery index at 24 h as compared with the non-swimming
control ( Fig. 1 B; Extended Data Fig. 1-2 ). It also correlated
with the significant drop in ATP level after the swimming
session measured fluorometrically from the worm lysate
(Fig. 1 C). After 90 min, the worms did episodic swimming
rather than continuous swimming ( Ghosh and Emmons,
2008 ). Therefore, we chose 90-min exercise windowfor our additional experiments. To confirm that the swim-
ming-induced improvement in functional recovery is
not because of the stress in liquid environment, rather
because of exercise, we paralyzed the worm during swim-
ming using levamisole that causes muscle hypercontrac-
tion ( Culetto et al., 2004 ;Fig. 1 D,E). The change in
swimming ability was measured as thrashing frequency
(Buckingham and Sattelle, 2009 ;Fig. 1 E). We observed
that the recovery index was significantly reduced when
swimming was perturbed ( Movie 2 ;Fig. 1 F). Levamisole
treatment in the swimming well per se did not affect the
touch response index measured after the withdrawal of le-
vamisole (Extended Data Fig. 1-1 B).
To determine the time duration required for seeing the
benefit of swimming, we varied the time window between
the swim session and evaluation of touch response (PTRI;
Fig. 1 G). Essentially, the swim session was gradually
shifted toward the time of postregeneration PTRI mea-
surement ( Fig. 1 G). When the window was lower than 12
h, in this case 6 h, the functional improvement was non-
significant ( Fig. 1 H). But when we increased the window,
by shifting the time of postregeneration PTRI measure-
ment further by 18 h, the functional improvement was sig-
nificant ( Fig. 1 I). Therefore, a critical time of 12 h is
needed for proper manifestation of positive effect of
swimming in regeneration.
Multiple swim sessions are needed in older ages for
the improvement in functional restoration
Next, we expanded our single swim-session paradigm
across various ages and found that this exercise regimen
can improve the recovery index significantly when axoto-
my was performed at L4, A1, A3, and A4 stages ( Fig. 2 A;
Extended Data Fig. 2-1 ). However, this improvement was
non-significant at day 5 (A5; Fig. 2 A; Extended Data Fig.
2-1). We noticed that the thrashing frequency during
swimming was significantly reduced at A5 stage ( Fig. 2 B),
which might have reduced the beneficial effect of swim-
ming in functional restoration. We wanted to test whether
multiple swimming sessions would be required at A5
stage for significant improvement in functional recovery.
To test this hypothesis, we increased the number of swim
sessions after the axotomy at A5 stage, one at 4 h and the
other at 12 h postaxotomy ( Fig. 2 C). Increasing the num-
ber of swim session raised the recovery index value signif-
icantly ( Fig. 2 D). Overall, our data suggest that swimming-
related exercise promotes functional restoration regard-
less of age, although in older age, multiple exercise ses-
sions are important.
Swim exercise also prevents the age-related decline
in touch neuron function
It might be possible that swim exercise improves the
touch neuron function in general, especially in older age
when function is known to decline ( Basu et al., 2017 ). As
reported previously, we found that PTRI value is signifi-
cantly dropped at A5 and subsequent life stages ( Fig. 3 B).
A single swim session of 90 min, 1 d before the PTRI mea-
surement ( Fig. 3 A) improved the PTRI value significantly

at A5 and A6 stages ( Fig. 3 B,C). However, in A8 stage, the
improvement in PTRI value because of single sessionswimming exercise was poor ( Fig. 3 B,C). No improvement
at A8 stage was also noticed in the zdIs5 (Pmec-4:: GFP)
transgenic reporter background ( Fig. 3 C). We asked
whether a longer gap between swim session and func-tional assessment would be sufficient to enhance thePTRI value significantly at A8 stage. However, no furtherimprovement in PTRI value was noticed when the exer-cise session was anticipated by 1 d ( Fig. 3 C). To test
whether multiple swimming sessions across multiple daysare helpful, we subjected the animals to four swimmingsessions starting from A1 with 1-d interval between twosessions and then measured touch response at A8 stage
(Fig. 3 D). Multiple swimming sessions significantly ele-
vated the PTRI value at A8 stage as compared with thatobtained from non-swimming control ( Fig. 3 D,E). Our data
highlight that exercise improves both age-dependentdecline in postaxotomy functional recovery, as well asprevents the age-related decline in touch neuron function.
This raises the possibility that the exercise might only im-
prove the neuronal function. Therefore, it needs to be re-
solved whether our exercise regimen would also enhance
axon regrowth potential after axotomy.
Swim session-mediated improvement in postaxotomy
functional restoration involves initiation of axonal
regeneration
Physical exercise mediated improvement in functional
recovery after neuronal injury often involves remodeling of
spared neuronal circuits ( van den Brand et al., 2015 ).
Therefore, we wanted to test whether the benefit of swim-
ming is because of compensatory mechanisms or re-
growth of the axotomized PLM neuron. The p38-MAPK
pathway involving DLK-1/MLK-1 is required in the early
stages of axon regeneration in a cell-autonomous manner
(Fig. 4 A;Hammarlund et al., 2009 ;Yan et al., 2009 ;
Ghosh-Roy et al., 2010 ). In the absence of this signaling
cascade, injured axon cannot initiate the growth cone
formation after axotomy. Therefore, the mutants affect-
ing the DLK-1 cascade serve as a tool to block the re-
generation from the injured proximal stump after
axotomy ( Fig. 4 D,r e da r r o w s ) .As w i ms e s s i o nn e i t h e ri n
dlk-1(0) nor in mlk-1(0) could promote functional resto-
ration in A3 ( Fig. 4 B). Similar observation was made in
dlk-1(0) , when the experiment was conducted at L4
stage ( Fig. 4 C). Similarly, an upregulation of microtu-
bule dynamics through microtubule plus-end binding
protein-1 EBP-1 is critical for the efficient axon re-
growth ( Chen et al., 2011 ;Ghosh-Roy et al., 2012 ). We
found that, the benefit of exercise was not seen in the
absence of ebp-1 (Fig. 4 B,
C). Consistently, swimming
could not promote the axon regrowth from the cut
stump in these mutants ( Fig. 4 D,E, red arrows). To rule
out the possibility of reduced swimming ability in these
mutants, we analyzed the movies of their swimming.
We found that thrashing frequency in these mutants are
comparable to that in wild-type control ( Fig. 4 F).
These results confirm that exercise mediated increase
in functional recovery involves regrowth from the injured
proximal stump of the PLM neuron and subsequent rewir-
ing into the functional circuit.
Swim session promotes axon regrowth and
postregrowth functional recovery
Although swimming induced improvement in functional
restoration involves initiation of axon regrowth after axot-
omy, it is not clear whether this exercise paradigm would
enhance anatomic features of axon regrowth or it could
simply enhance the functional aspect after axon regrows.
The fact that swimming can enhance touch sensation be-
havior in older age, leaves the second possibility open. To
test this, we performed confocal imaging of the regrowth
events after assaying for the functional restoration ( Fig.
5A), and correlated the behavioral recovery with the ana-
tomic patterns of regeneration. We found that swimming
exercise in A3 worms accelerated the initiation of the re-
growth as revealed by the increased number of filopodia-A

like extension at the cut stump at 6 h postaxotomy ( Fig. 5 B,
arrowheads). The median value for the number of filopodiais increased from 1 to 2 because of the exercise session(*p= 0.01, Mann –Whitney Utest). At 24 h postaxotomy,
there was an enhancement in axonal regrowth as comparedwith the control condition ( Fig. 5 B). Regrowth value in the
swimming group becomes 114.0 663.81 mma sc o m p a r e d
with the value 83.46 641.62 mm obtained in non-swimming

percentage of self-fusion events with respect to the recon-nection events ( Ghosh-Roy et al., 2010 ;Neumann et al.,
2011 ,2015 ;Basu et al., 2017 ;Neumann and Hilliard, 2019 )
between proximal and distal ends are significantly increased
because of the swimming session ( Fig. 5 C,D).We further investigated whether the improvement in
functional restoration seen because of swim exercise cor-relates with the “fusion ”or“non-fusion ”events, or both the
categories of regrowth. We found that there is a significantincrease in the recovery index for both the fusion event andnon-fusion events ( Fig. 5 E). Upon correlating the regrowth
pattern of the non-fusion events, we found that the regrow-ing axon, which goes toward the ventral cord and showsan enrichment of the presynaptic reporter mCherry::RAB-3at the ventral cord ( Fig. 5 Fc, arrowheads) corresponds to
successful recovery in the swimming group as the value ofthe recovery index of this class is 2.66 10.73 ( Fig. 5 G). We
called this category of as ventral targeting events. The re-

was significantly higher as compared with the index ob-
tained in the other classes such as “straight regrowth ”(Fig.
5Fa)a n d “multibranch regrowth ”(Fig. 5 Fb). The percent-
age of ventral targeting events got increased on swim exer-
cise ( Fig. 5 H). Since the distal end often persisted after
injury ( Fig. 5 Fa,b), we asked whether the “intact distal end ”
could be contributing to the functional recovery. However,
the recovery indices in the distal intact and “distal degener-
ated ”categories were comparable in both swimming and
non-swimming groups ( Fig. 5 I). Therefore, the enhance-
ment of functional restoration because of swim exercise
corresponds to successful rewiring process.
Exercise-mediated improvement in touch neuron
function requires metabolic energy sensor AAK-2
During exercise, there is a consumption of energy in the
form of ATP, which results in an increase in an AMP:ATPratio ( Chen et al., 2003 ). The increase in this ratio is
sensed by the metabolic energy sensor kinase known asAMPK ( Hardie, 2011 ). The physical exercise in mamma-
lian system leads to activation of AMPK ( Chen et al.,
2003 ;Gibala et al., 2009 ). As in mammals, the two cata-
lytic subunits of AMPK in C. elegans are encoded by two
genes aak-1 and aak-2 (Apfeld et al., 2004 ). Wehypothesized that the decrease in ATP levels after the 90-
min swimming session might be sensed by AAK-2 in neu-
rons or muscle to regulate regeneration. To test this pos-
sibility, we gave the aak-2 mutant a 90-min swim session
at various life stages starting from A1 to A7 and measuredthe posterior touch response (PTRI) after 24 h ( Fig. 6 A).
We found that there is drop in touch response index value
inaak-2 mutant starting from A5 stage similar to the wild
type ( Fig. 6 B). However, the swim session could not ele-
vate the PTRI in any of the life stages ( Fig. 6 B). We won-
dered, whether the abrogation of the exercise-inducedelevation in PTRI value in aak-2(0) is due the reduced
swimming ability of the mutant. However, the thrashing
frequency in this mutant at L4, A3, and A5 stages were
comparable to the same values in wild-type control ( Fig.
6C). This indicated that AAK-2 might be specifically re-
quired for the exercise-induced changes in neuronal re-
generation and function ( Fig. 6 D). To understand the
tissue-specific requirement of aak-2 in this phenomenon,
we have expressed aak-2 in muscle, epidermal cells and
touch neuron exclusively. We found that both touch neuronand muscle-specific expression of aak-2 can rescue the
swim session-induced phenomenon significantly ( Fig. 6 E).
However, no rescue was observed when aak-2 was ex-
pressed in epithelial cells situated just next to the PLM axonA

(Fig. 6 E). Next, we tested whether the AMPK activator met-
formin ( Foretz et al., 2014 ;Rena et al., 2017 ) can mimic the
benefits of swimming in touch neuron function ( Fig. 6 F). To
address this question, we treated the worms with 50 m M
metformin while they were kept paralyzed in the swimming
well for 90 min ( Fig. 6 F). Metformin treatment was sufficient
to enhance the PTRI value in A5 worms ( Fig. 6 G). This effect
of metformin was absent in aak-2 mutant ( Fig. 6 G) indicating
that effect of metformin in our assays is specific to AAK-2
function. These observations suggest that neuron-specificand muscle-specific activity of AAK-2 is important for swim-
exercise-induced enhancement of touch neuron function.

session, while these animals were paralyzed with levami-
sole in the swimming well ( Fig. 7 A). Previously we have
shown that when worms are paralyzed during the swim
session, enhancement of functional restoration is blocked
(Fig. 1 F). We found that metformin treatment significantly
enhanced the recovery index as compared with the non-
treated control ( Fig. 7 B). Total regrowth from the proxi-
mal stump ( Fig. 7 C, red arrows) at 24 h postaxotomy
was also increased significantly in the metformin-
treated group ( Fig. 7 C,D). The regrowth value becomes
91.77 636.19 mm in metformin-treated group as com-
pared with 62.87 624.36 mm in untreated group. We no-
ticed that there is an increase in the recovery index forboth non-fusion-related and fusion-related events at A3
stage ( Fig. 7 E). These observations suggest that AMPK
activation is sufficient to mimic the effect of swimming
exercise in axonal regeneration as well as functional
recovery.
The aak-2 mutant shows reduced axon regrowth
(Hubert et al., 2014 ; Extended Data Fig. 7-1 A,B), which re-
sulted in a loss of swim-exercise-mediated enhancement
of postaxotomy recovery index at A3 stage ( Fig. 7 F). We
found that the expression of aak-2 either in touch neurons
or in muscle rescues the axon regrowth defect in aak-2
mutant at L4 stage (Extended Data Fig. 7-1 A,B).
However, the postinjury recovery index was only rescuedsignificantly by the touch neuron-specific expression of
aak-2 at L4 stage (Extended Data Fig. 7-1 C). These trans-
genes also rescued the loss in benefit of swim session infunctional recovery in aak-2 mutant at A3 stage ( Fig. 7 F).
Expression of aak-2 in epithelial cells however did notrescue these phenotypes in aak-2 mutant ( Fig. 7 F;
Extended Data Fig. 7-1 A–C). These results indicate that
AAK-2 acts both cell autonomously in neuron and non-
cell autonomously in muscle for transducing the effect of
swim exercise in effective axon regeneration.
Discussion
In this study, using a well-established swimming para-
digm we have studied the effect of physical exercise in
functional recovery after the axonal injury of mechanosen-
sory neuron. A swim session following axotomy promotes
functional recovery regardless of age. This exercise regi-
men can also help overcome age-related decline in touchneuron function. By correlating anatomic features of axonregrowth with the behavioral index, we found that theswimming exercise enhances both postinjury axon re-
growth as well as functional recovery. We further showed
that the activity of the metabolic energy sensor AMPK inmuscle as well as in injured neuron is critical in convertingthe energy spent during exercise into the positive effect inaxon regeneration ( Fig. 8 ).
InC. elegans, it is shown that a single swim session of
90 min presents exercise-like features such as muscle fa-
tigue, a reduction of fat level in muscle, decrease in car-
bohydrate metabolism and enhanced mitochondrial
oxidation ( Laranjeiro et al., 2017 ). Many of these phenom-
ena share commonalities with the physical exercise in ver-
tebrate models ( Thompson et al., 2001 ;Rivera-Brown and
Frontera, 2012 ;Vina et al., 2012 ). In continuation to this
finding, multiple and regular exercise sessions increaseAxonal Injury

life-span, health quality, and protect against neurodegen-
eration in models of tauopathy, Alzheimer ’s disease, and
Huntington ’s disease ( Laranjeiro et al., 2019 ). It also in-
creases overall learning ability as seen in other modelsand humans ( Kobilo et al., 2014 ;Moon et al., 2016 ). These
findings made it very relevant to address the role of physi-
cal exercise in promoting the repair of the injured neuronalcircuitry using a worm model. We found that a 90-minswim session after the axotomy is sufficient to overcomeage-related decline in axon regeneration and functionalrestoration. Intriguingly, this exercise paradigm is alsosufficient to improve the functional recovery in earlystages of life. Previous literature has demonstrated the
benefit of physical exercise in peripheral nerve regenera-
tion ( Park and Höke, 2014 ;Gordon and English, 2016 ;
Chen et al., 2017b ). Since our behavioral assay is specific
to single neuron responsible for touch sensation, we pro-vided a direct evidence that enhanced axon regrowth be-cause of physical exercise drives functional recovery.
An immediate effect of exercise is a reduction in the ratio of
ATP/AMP ( Chen et al., 2003 ), which is sensed by AMP
Kinase ( Hardie, 2011 ). Following the swimming session, we
recorded a significant drop in ATP level. Therefore, we specu-lated a role of AMPK/AAK-2 in exercise-mediated impro-vement in touch neurons function. Consistent with thishypothesis, the loss of aak-2 significantly abolished the im-
provement in touch neurons regeneration and function be-cause of swimming exercise. Conversely, activation of AMPK
using metformin was sufficient to promote axon regeneration.
Tissue-specific rescue experiments suggested that AAK-2acts both in neuron and muscle for enhanced axon regenera-tion and functional recovery. Few studies indicated thatactivation of AMPK by metformin has positive effect after spi-nal cord injury ( Zhang et al., 2017 ;Guo et al., 2018 ).
Pharmacological activation of AMPK can promote musclefiber regeneration in a mouse myopathy model ( Peralta et al.,
2016 ). The AMPK agonist AICAR enhances spatial memory
in wild-type animals, but this improvement was lacking inmuscle-specific mutant of AMPK pointing toward the link be-tween muscles and nervous system ( Kobilo et al., 2014 ).
The question is how activated AAK-2 could be enhanc-
ing axon regeneration. It has been observed that postex-
ercise activation of AMPK leads to the ATP synthesis via
various metabolic pathways ( Winder and Hardie, 1996 ;
Hutber et al., 1997 ;Hardie, 2004 ). It also leads to mito-
chondrial biogenesis through proliferator-activated recep-tor
gcoactivator-1 a(PGC-1 a;Zong et al., 2002 ;
Kukidome et al., 2006 ). After a neuronal injury, the growth
cone formation and subsequent regrowth is driven by var-
ious enzymes and motors. This requires high level of en-
ergy ( Bradke et al., 2012 ;Zhou et al., 2016 ). Therefore,
AMPK-driven ATP production can boost up the initiation
of axon regeneration process as seen in our analysis.
Apart from restoring the cellular energy levels, AMPK also
regulates autophagy which allows the cell to survive the
metabolic stress ( Zhao and Klionsky, 2011 ). Autophagy
induction has been linked with the stabilization of microtu-
bules and enhancement of axonal regeneration after neu-
ronal injury ( He et al., 2016 ;Ko et al., 2020 ). Other
possibility through which the AMPK can enhance axon re-
generation is through DAF-16/FOXO1 activation. Theactivated AMPK can directly phosphorylate and regulate
DAF-16 ( Greer et al., 2007 ), which is known to regulate
axon regeneration ( Byrne et al., 2014 ). It would be an in-
teresting direction to unravel how AMPK signaling cou-ples muscle and neuron in neuronal regeneration.
