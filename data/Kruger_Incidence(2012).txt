Abstract  
 
Incidence of shoulder injuries have been widely reported for work -related musculoskeletal pain in the 
upper extremities, but there is a lim ited amount of research and statistics available that reports on the 
incidence of shoulder pain in master swimmers. This study investigated the association between 
literature identified risk factors and the incidence of shoulder pain in South African maste r swimmers. 
A total of 282 m aster swimmers completed a shoulder pain and related risk factors questionnaire  
during the 2010 South African Masters Swimming Championships. Statistical analysis of the data was 
done to determine frequencies, percentages, odds ratios and significance levels. Shoulder pain was 
found to be more likely in females (odds ratio (OR) = 1.3), smokers (OR = 1.8),  swimmers swimming 
more than one stroke (OR = 1.2) and competitive swimmers (OR = 2.2). Swimmers engaging in 
strength training (OR = 0.78) showed a reduced incidence of shoulder pain. The calculated incidence 
of shoulder pain over the three -year period among the master swimmers was 62.4%. Significant 
statistical associations between shoulder pain and the risk factors of osteoporos is, volume of training 
and competitiveness were found. This high incidence of shoulder pain highlights the need for the 
development of interventions to prevent these injuries in master swimmers. Further research is needed 
to determine the incidence and cau ses of shoulder pain in other swimming populations in South 
Africa.

Introduction  
 
Swimming is a popular leisure time pursuit in South Africa. Masters swimming has 
been growing i n popularity, and open water swims such as the Midmar Mile have 
been achieving record entry volumes. Due to the increased importance attached to 
exercise and a healthy lifestyle more people look for recreational pursuits like 
swimming that provide these be nefits. Swimming also provides a good non -weight 
bearing alternative to exercise for people in all age groups as well as people suffering 
from injury or disease.  
 
The benefits of exercise through the aging process have been widely reported (Daley 
& Spinks, 2000; Paterson, Jones & Rice,  2007).  Exercise such as swimming 
increases muscle strength and power, and will increas e functional ability in the 
58   Krüger, Dressler a nd Botha  
activities of daily living in the very old (Daley & Spinks, 2000; Paterson et al.,  
2007).  
 
The term “swimmers shoulder” is often used to describe a combination of soft tissue 
injuries that lead to shoulder pain in swimmers (Goldstein & Tanner, 1999) . 
Competitive swimmers at all levels of participation suffer from a variety of shoulder 
injuries that include rotator cuff disease. Studies have shown that pain from shoulder 
injuries can interfere with training and can seriously affect swimming performance 
(McMaster, Robberts & Stodard, 1998).  
 
Prevalence and incidence of shoulder injuries have been wide ly reported for work -
related musculoskeletal pain in the upper extremities (Werner, Franzblau, Gell, Ulin 
& Armstrong, 2005; Roquelaure, Leclerc, Touranchet, Sauteron, Melchior, Imbernon 
& Goldberg, 2006) . Roquelaure et al. (2006) study involvin g 2 685 men and women 
in 2003 in France showed the incidence of shoulder injuries over one year to be 
34.3% in women and 39.8% in men. Werner et al. (2005) found in a cohort study 
over 5.4 years that 94 out of 350 industrial and clerical workers developed upper 
extremity musculoskeletal disorders.  
 
In a cross -sectional survey conducted by Puckree and Thomas (2006) on competitive 
swimmers between the ages of 13 and 25 in KwaZulu -Natal, 71% of the respondents 
experienced shoulder pain, while 64% reported act ual shoulder injuries which 
included impingement, supraspinatus and bicipital tendonitis, bursitis and muscle 
strain. There is, however, a limited amount of research and statistics available that 
report on the incidence of shoulder pain in master swimmers (McMaster & Tramp, 
1993) . 
 
Swimming is a sport involving repetitive force application by the shoulder and arm. 
Epidemiological studies and reviews of work -related upper extremity 
musculoskeletal pain found evidence that repetitive mechanical loading and th e 
application of force above shoulder height increase the incidence of shoulder pain 
(Sommerich & Hughes, 2006, Nawoczenski, Ritter -Soronen, Wilson, Howe & 
Ludewig,  2006) . As certain jobs share the same biomechanical movement patterns 
and loading as swimming, the risk factors that predict shoulder injury in these jobs 
may be relevant to the development of shoulder pain in swimmers.  
 
The workplace, lifestyle and demographic risk factors identified in literature on 
work -related and sport -related studies to determine the risk factors and predictors of 
shoulder pain in a variety of populations are summarised in Table 1.

The primary objective of the study was to determine the incidence of shoulder pain 
in master swim mers in South Africa. The secondary objective was to determine 
whether a relationship exists between selected risk factors and the occurrence of 
shoulder pain among the master swimmers.  
 
Methods and Material  
 
Study design  
 
The research was conducted as a r etrospective case control study and data were 
collected using a questionnaire.   
 
60   Krüger, Dressler a nd Botha  
Population and sample  
 
In early 2010, 450 master swimmers (220 women and 230 men) entered to compete 
in the South African Masters National Swimming Championships. Among these  
were 18 foreign swimmers from Russia, UK, Swaziland and Germany who were 
excluded from the study. Of the 450 swimmers, 417 travelled to Pretoria in March 
2010 and actually competed in the championships.  
 
Questionnaire  
 
A shoulder pain and related risk fa ctors questionnaire for master swimmers in South 
Africa  was constructed firstly to determine the incidence of shoulder pain in master 
swimmers over a three -year period. Questions in this section also reported on the 
number of times pain was experienced wit hin the period and any known causes.  
 
The presence of risk factors at the time of the injury was also surveyed in the same 
questionnaire. Only the variables listed in Table 1 that could successfully be 
surveyed were selected. This excluded psychosocial ris k factors that can easily be 
flawed in recall. Thirty data items covering demographic, lifestyle, training habits 
and general health were surveyed.  
 
Demographic details included data items such as age, gender, height and weight, 
while the lifestyle section  determined the smoking status of the individual. The 
general health section of the questionnaire included questions regarding the timing 
and the occurrence of illnesses linked to shoulder pain such as rheumatoid arthritis, 
osteoarthritis, osteoporosis and  diabetes. The section of training habits included data 
items such as training stroke, training volume and whether the individual engaged in 
resistance training.  
 
The questionnaire did not include any data items that reported on the recovery from 
or inter ventions taken by the swimmers in the recovery process.  
 
Validity and reliability  
 
Internal validity refers to the extent to which differences identified among people is a 
result of the intervention or variable being tested ( Eldridge, Ashby, Benett, Wakel in 
& Feder,  2008). To ensure internal validity to eliminate selection bias, the case and 
control groups were tested and found to be similar in age, gender and BMI. 
Information bias was eliminated because the case and control groups completed the 
same quest ionnaire at the same time. Recall bias was also limited by restricting the 
research period to only three years. The questionnaires were also completed 
anonymously, further eliminating possible bias.  
 
Incidence of shoulder injuries among  master swimmers    61 
Interpretation of results can be affected by possible co nfounders. Confounders are 
important in determining whether an apparent association is in fact attributable to 
other factors such as age or gender differences. Possible confounders were identified 
in the study as being:  
 
 Illnesses can confound the odds rat ios of other risk factors.  
 Trauma can confound the odds ratios of other risk factors.  
 Other activities indicated to be the cause of shoulder pain can confound the odds 
ratios of other risk factors.  
 
All these risk factors had very low frequencies and it wa s assumed that the effect of 
the confounding on the odds ratio would not be significant. Implementing the 
controls for internal validity ensured that the conclusions drawn in the study are 
warranted by the data (Leedy & Ormrod, 2001) .  
 
External validity  refers to the extent to which the study results can be generalised to 
other individuals or settings and situations (Eldridge et al., 2008). The results of this 
study cannot be generalised to the wider population but can be applied to other 
master swimmers in similar settings.  
 
Reliability  has to do with the degree to which a measurement instrument produces 
consistent results (Leedy & Ormrod, 2001) . Reliability was ensured by giving all the 
participants the same standardised questionnaire to complete. No further measures of 
reliability were included in the study.  
 
Data and statist ical methods  
 
The numerical and categorical data from the questionnaires were captured into an 
Excel database and encoded with numerical values. All statistical tests were 
performed using Excel and Statistical Packages for the Social Sciences (SPSS) 
softwa re. Means and standard deviations were used to describe demographic details 
such as age and gender. The height and weight data items were used to calculate the 
Body Mass Index (BMI) for each swimmer. Charts were plotted for the demographic 
data and some ri sk factors such as BMI.  
 
The data were categorised to indicate swimmers shoulder pain (cases) and those 
without pain (controls). A t -test was calculated to determine if statistical differences 
existed between cases and controls in terms of the mean ages, genders and BMI. 
Odds ratios (OR) were calculated as estimated measures of association between each 
risk factor and the outcome, namely shoulder pain and a 95% confidence interval 
(CI) was applied.

Results  
 
Response rate  
 
Two hundred eighty two (n=282) mas ter swimmers completed the shoulder pain and 
related risk factors questionnaire after exclusion of 10 pre -master (younger than 25 
years) swimmers. The response rate at the championships was thus 67.6%. The high 
response rate was achieved through the distri bution to and control of questionnaires 
by the respective club captains. Club captains were briefed personally on the goals of 
the study and the ethical considerations. The questionnaire was only two pages long, 
further ensuring higher response rate.  
 
The participants’ identities were kept confidential by separating questionnaires and 
informed consent forms, and only placing respondent numbers on the questionnaires.   
 
Demographic analysis  
 
Questionnaires were completed by 282 swimmers of which 144 were fe males and 
136 were males. Females comprised 51.1%  of the sample and males, 48.9%.  The age 
distribution for the swimmers is depicted in Figure 1.

Incidence  
 
The calculated incidence of shoulder pain over the three -year period in the master 
swimmers was 62.4%. Of these swimmers, 28.7% indicated that they experienced 
recurring pain during the three -year period and 20.9% described their pain as 
chronic. In 37.2% of the swimmers the pain was so severe that they had to 
discontinue their training. Swimmers gave the responses provided in Table 2 
concerning the possible causes of their shoulder pain.

When asked if these activities contributed to the ir shoulder pain, swimmers indicated 
that the activities of gymnasium, golf, rowing and waterpolo did. These data could, 
however, not be used, as the questions were not structured well enough to isolate any 
confounding risk factors.

Comparison of case and control groups  
 
There were no significant differences between the case group and the control group for age 
gender and BMI. These groups can therefore be considered homogenous.  
 
Age 
 
Werner et al. (2005) found that it is not com mon for a person to develop non -
traumatic shoulder tendonitis before the age of 40, but it is fairly common in older 
individuals. This association is mostly related to repeated injury over time and the 
body’s decreased ability to repair the injury quickly.  Range of motion (ROM) and 
joint stiffness increases with age. This is mostly due to degenerative changes in the 
elastin component of connective tissue that surround the joints (Baechle  & Earle, 
2008) . This may lead to an increase in shoulder injuries with age.  
 
The average age of swimmers at the championships was 49 years for females and 50 
years for males. The oldest female swimmer was 90 years old and the oldest male 
swimmer was aged 81 ye ars.  
 
The odds ratio decreased between the ages of 35 -55, maybe showing the protective 
effect of swimming. As expected, the odds ratio gradually increased over the age 
groups from age 55 onwards, showing that the older swimmers were more likely to 
develop  shoulder pain than the younger swimmers. However, the tests showed no 
significant association between age and the incidence of shoulder pain in the 
swimmers.  
 
Gender  
 
Treaster and Burr (2004) conducted a literature review to determine whether women 
experi ence higher prevalence of upper extremity musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) 
than men. They reviewed 56 articles on gender differences in incidence, prevalence 
and frequency rates for MSDs of the upper extremity. Most of the studies showed 
that women had sig nificantly higher incidence of upper extremity MSDs than men. 
Although the odds ratio showed that females were 1.3 times more likely to develop 
shoulder pain than the male swimmers, the tests showed no significant association 
between gender and incidence o f shoulder pain in the swimmers.  
 
Incidence of shoulder injuries among  master swimmers    69 
Gun (1990) found that the incidence rates varied between different occupations and 
stated that the gender differences were not so much biological differences but that 
they were rather mostly due to the different tasks ass igned to women and men. Male 
and female swimmers train and compete in the same strokes, and this might offer 
some insight into the fact that the association of shoulder pain to gender is not 
significant.  
 
Body mass index (BMI)   
 
BMI is a measurement that h as replaced weight as the preferred determinant of 
obesity (Williams, 2007) . Results indicate that almost double the amount of males to 
female swimmers fall in the overweight and obese categor ies. The average BMI for 
females and males were 24 and 27 respectively.  
 
Werner et al. (2005) found that a person with a BMI over 30 is likely to develop an 
upper extremity tendonitis (UET) in the near future. There is no clear explanation for 
BMI as a ris k factor for UET, except that it possibly acts as an indicator of 
deconditioning.  
 
The 1.01 odds ratio for overweight/obese swimmers shows that BMI does not affect 
the odds ratio of shoulder pain in master swimmers. This might substantiate the joint 
protec tive properties of swimming, as it provides a good non -weight bearing 
alternative to exercise for overweight and obese individuals. The tests slso showed 
no significant association between BMI and the incidence of shoulder pain in the 
swimmers.  
 
Smoking  
 
The study by  Northover, Lunn, Clark and Phillipson (2007) suggests that limited 
micro vascular blood supply to the tendons of the rotator cuff muscles predisposes 
the muscles to atrophy. It would be expected that smoking will increase the risk of 
rotator cu ff disease in a similar way, but the study did not find smoking to be a risk 
factor. A study by Werner et al. (2005) found that the incidence of upper extremity 
tendonitis amongst smokers over a 5.4 -year period was 34.6%. In this study a n 
average of 89.6% of swimmers were found to be non -smokers. A total of 36 master 
swimmers are currently smoking. This constitutes only 12.8% of the sampled 
swimmers.  
 
Although odds ratios showed that smokers were 1.8 times more likely to develop 
shoulder pain, no statistica lly significant association could be established between 
smoking and the incidence of shoulder pain due to the small number of smokers in 
the present study.  
 
 
70   Krüger, Dressler a nd Botha  
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA)  
 
Antoniou, Tsai, Baker, Schumacher, Williams and  Ianotti  (2003) found t hat 
incidence of rotator cuff pathology (which causes shoulder pain) is higher in patients 
with rheumatoid arthritis, but they might mistake the pain they felt from shoulder 
impingement for inflammatory pain of the glenohumeral joint (Northover et al.,  
2007). Only eight swimmers indicated that they suffered from RA. The odds ratio 
showed a high negative association with shoulder pain, which could possibly be 
linked to the use of anti -inflammatory medication. No statistically significant 
association could be  established between RA and shoulder pain in this study.  
 
Osteoarthritis (OA)  
 
People who suffer from osteoarthritis seem to have an increased risk of rotator cuff 
disease and this may predispose them to sub -acromial osteophytes at the acromio -
clavicular j oint. This can be abrasive to the supraspinatus tendon, and cause 
inflammation and tears (Antoniou et al., 2003; Northover et al., 2007). Twenty -two 
swimmers indicated that they had suffered from OA for an average of 8.3 years. 
However, no statistically si gnificant association could be established between OA 
and shoulder pain in this study.  
 
Osteoporosis (OP)  
 
Due to the non -weight -bearing characteristic of swimming it has been associated 
with bone mineral density deficits in female swimmers, which is a ri sk factor for 
osteoporosis later in life (Derman, Cinemre, Kanbur, Doğan, Kılıç & Karaduman, 
2008) . Osteoporosis can lead to compression fractures in the thoracic spine, which 
tend to collapse anteriorly, develop rounding of the back (kyphosis), which leads to 
loss of height and may lead to back and shoulder pain (Prior, Barr, Chow & 
Faulkner, 1996) . Ten of the surveyed swimmers indicated that they had suffered 
from osteoporosis for an average of 5.7 years. The  odds ratio showed that swimmers 
with OP were 4.08 times more likely to develop shoulder pa in. A  statistically 
significant association was established between OP and shoulder pain among the 
swimmers.  
 
Diabetes  
 
In this study diabetes was found to be a significant risk factor for the development of 
rotator cuff disease. This is because diabetes affects the micro vascular blood supply 
and this then impedes the supply of nutrients, predisposing the muscles to atrophy. It 
also reduces the ability of the tendon to repair itself in the event of trauma 
(Northover et al. , 2007). According to Laslett, Bu rnet, Redmond and McNeil  (2008), 
shoulder pain and disability are common and persistent in adults with diabetes.  Poor 
glycaemia control and diabetic complications are factors that can worsen shoulder

pain and disability. There were seven swimmers who indic ated that they had been 
diagnosed with diabetes. Only one swimmer had suffered from the disease for more 
than 20 years. The odds ratio was 1.1, indicating only a slightly higher increased risk 
of shoulder pain linked to diabetes. However, n o statistically significant association 
could be established between diabetes and shoulder pain in this study.    
 
Trauma  
 
One of the work -related risk factors for shoulder and neck pain identified by Padma 
and Balasubramanie (2008) is previous trauma. Shugars, Williams, Cline  and 
Fishburne (1984) concluded in their study that prevalence of musculoskeletal 
disorder was related to sports injuries and trauma injuries. Twenty -four swimmers 
indicated that their shoulder pain resulted from a traumatic event. No further details 
as to the nature of this traumatic event were included in the questionnaire.  
 
Swimming stroke  
 
According to Padma and Balasubramanie (2008) working with arms above shoulder 
level is one of the mechanical -related risk factors to shoulder pain. Work by 
Jarvh olm, Palmerud, Styf, Herberts  and Kadefors (1988)  on muscle physiology 
showed that when the arm is raised above 30˚, the pressure within the supraspinatus 
muscle increases to such an extent that normal blood flow to the muscle might be 
impaired. This can c ontribute to rotator cuff disease and ultimately shoulder pain.  
 
Northover et al. (2007) also found that regular overhead activities increased the risk 
of rotator cuff disease. High rates of shoulder pain are seen in people who are 
exposed to routine over head work, such as construction workers or athletes whose 
sports involve frequent overhead arm use. This pain frequently progresses to 
functional loss and disability (Nawoczenski et al., 2006).  
 
The strokes front crawl, breaststroke and butterfly all have the potential for incorrect 
stroke mechanics due to incorrect catch positions and force application above 
shoulder height (Maglischo, 2003) . Front crawl and backstroke use alternating arm 
patterns and a body roll i s used to position the shoulder effectively. Breaststroke and 
butterfly use a simultaneous bilateral arm action with no body roll. Breaststroke has 
the lowest reported incidence of shoulder injuries (Souza, 1995) . 
 
Swimmers we re asked to indicate in which stroke they did most of their training. 
Unfortunately due to the way the question was structured, this caused ambiguity and 
many swimmers indicated more than one stroke in their answer. The data was sorted 
according to the fol lowing categories:  
 
 
 
72   Krüger, Dressler a nd Botha  
 Those who indicated only freestyle  
 Those who indicated only breaststroke  
 Those who indicated more than one stroke  
 Those who indicated butterfly  
 
Odds ratios were determined for the categories comparing them to swimmers who 
swam freest yle only as a reference. Results indicated that swimming more than one 
stroke raised the risk of developing shoulder pain slightly. No statistically significant 
association was established between swimming stroke and shoulder pain in this 
study.    
 
Volume of training  
 
According to Northover et al. (2007), people who undertake manual work are at 
higher risk of developing shoulder pain through rotator cuff disease than those who 
have a clerical job. They also identified a relationship between the strenuousnes s of 
the work undertaken and the development of rotator cuff disease. They found that the 
probability ratios of developing this disease with clerical, light and heavy manual 
work were 1: 1.85: 3.81, respectively. In a survey of the training habits of USA 
master swimmers, Taylor, Stager, Tanner, Battista and Roberts (2001) found that the 
swimmers averaged four days of training per week all year round with an almost 
uniform training volume across all age groups of between 1800 m and 3 200 m per 
session with v ery little difference between the genders.  
 
The volume training load of the master swimmers was calculated for each swimmer 
by multiplying the weekly frequency of training with the daily distance per training 
session. This was then divided into three grou ps according to the following criteria:  
 
 Low volume   0-4 999 m/week  
 Medium volume  5 000 -11 999 m/week  
 High volume   12 000 m and greater/week  
 
Odds ratios were calculated comparing low/medium volume swimmers with high 
volume swimmers. It showed that low v olume swimmers were 2.8 times more likely 
to develop shoulder pain. This result is contradictory to previous research and may 
be linked to the fact that swimmers are swimming less due to the high incidence of 
shoulder pain. Puckree and Thomas (2006) found that 75% of the swimmers who 
complained of shoulder injuries had to stop swimming temporarily due to the injury. 
Finding an association between volume of training and shoulder pain will need 
further prospective research. A  statistically significant associa tion was established 
between the volume of training and shoulder pain in this study.

Competitiveness  
 
Competitive swimmers engage in professional training programmes and sport -
specific conditioning in order to optimise performance. Sein (2008) found th at large 
amounts of swimming training (number of hours swam per week and weekly 
mileage) in competitive swimmers resulted in a higher incidence of supraspinatus 
tendinopathy.   
 
A total of 165 swimmers indicated that they perceived themselves to be recreat ional 
swimmers, while 74 swimmers regarded themselves as competitive swimmers. Odds 
ratios indicated that competitive swimmers were 2.2 times more likely to develop 
shoulder pain than recreational swimmers. A  statistically significant association was 
estab lished between the competitiveness of swimmers and shoulder pain in this 
study.    
 
Strength training  
 
People undertaking shoulder intensive recreational activities such as weight training 
are at an increased risk of developing rotator cuff disease (Northov er et al., 2007). 
Odds ratios indicated that master swimmers who did strength training had a reduced 
risk of developing shoulder pain. This may indicate a protective association for 
swimmers who strengthen the shoulder joint through regular strength traini ng. No  
statistically significant association could be established between the strength training 
and shoulder pain in this study.    
 
Limitations of the study  
 
Master swimmers can compete in both open water and pool competitions. Only 
swimmers who are regist ered with the South African Master Swimmers (SAMS) and 
Swim South Africa (SSA) can compete in the national championships. Master 
swimmers who compete in open water events do not have to register. This study was 
limited to swimmers who were registered with SSA. Furthermore, master swimmers 
with current severe shoulder pain might not have entered for the championships and 
were thus excluded from the survey. This might have led to underreporting of injury 
incidence rates. A test -retest reliability test should have been done, but because the 
master swimmers were only available during the South African Masters National 
Swimming Championships, it was not possible.  
 
Conclusion and Recommendations  
 
Master swimmers in South Africa are not professionally supported, an d usually have 
wide responsibilities such as families and work. Shoulder pain not only impacts  on 
the training and performance of these swimmers, but also carries over into other 
spheres of life that may for instance lead to lost work time (McMaster et al. , 1998).

Understanding the risk factors of shoulder pain will help in the prediction and early 
diagnosis of shoulder injuries. Early diagnosis improves the prognosis for complete 
recovery from the injuries. It will allow master swimmers to enjoy the benef its of 
fitness and exercise until old age.  
 
The study showed significant statistical associations between shoulder pain and the 
risk factors of osteoporosis, volume of training and competitiveness in the sampled 
master swimmers. The incidence of shoulder pain in the master swimmers was 
64.2%. Reporting on this high incidence highlights the need for the development of 
interventions to prevent shoulder injuries in recreational and competitive master 
swimmers.  
 
Further research is needed to determine the inc idence of shoulder pain in other 
swimming populations in South Africa; specifically open water swimming that is 
growing in popularity in South Africa. The relationship between volume of training 
and shoulder pain also needs further investigation.
