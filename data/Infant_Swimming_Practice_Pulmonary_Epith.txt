ABSTRACT
OBJECTIVE. Irritant gases and aerosols contaminating the air of indoor swimming
pools can affect the lung epithelium and increase asthma risk in children. We
evaluated the impact of infant swimming practice on allergic status and respiratory
health later in childhood.
METHODS. Clara cell protein, surfactant-associated protein D, and total and aeroal-
lergen-speciﬁc immunoglobulin E were measured in the serum of 341 schoolchil-
dren aged 10 to 13 years, among whom 43 had followed an infant swimming
program. Asthma was deﬁned as doctor-diagnosed asthma and/or positive exer-
cise-induced bronchoconstriction (15% decrease in postexercise forced expiratory
volume).
RESULTS. There were no signiﬁcant differences between the infant swimming group
and the other children regarding the levels of exhaled nitric oxide and total or
aeroallergen-speciﬁc serum immunoglobulin E. Children who swam as infants
showed, by contrast, a signiﬁcant decrease of serum Clara cell protein and of the
serum Clara cell protein/surfactant-associated protein D ratio integrating Clara cell
damage and permeability changes of the lung epithelial barrier. These effects were
associated with higher risks of asthma and of recurrent bronchitis. Passive expo-
sure to tobacco alone had no effect on these outcomes but seemed to interact with
infant swimming practice to increase the risk of asthma or of recurrent bronchitis.
CONCLUSIONS. Our data suggest that infant swimming practice in chlorinated indoor
swimming pools is associated with airways changes that, along with other factors,
seem to predispose children to the development of asthma and recurrent
bronchitis.www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/

PUBLIC SWIMMING POOLS need to be disinfected, and
usually this is done by water chlorination using
sodium or calcium hypochlorite, chlorine gas, or
chloroisocyanurates. These chlorine-based disinfectants,
loosely referred to as “chlorine,” are added in water to
release hypochlorous acid, a powerful oxidant that is the
active biocide. When reacting with nitrogenous com-
pounds originating from sweat, saliva, or urine brought
by swimmers, hypochlorous acid generates a complex
mixture of harmful byproducts, among which the most
irritant are the chloramines. Monochloramine and di-
chloramine (NH2Cl and NHCl2, respectively) are water
soluble, and the sum of their concentrations in water are
referred to as combined chlorine. By contrast, the tri-
chloramine also called nitrogen trichloride (NCl3)i sa
water-insoluble gas that, once formed, is immediately
released in the air, which gives indoor pools their dis-
tinctive “chlorine” smell. Depending on the bather’s hy-
giene and the pool ventilation, mean levels of trichlora-
mine in community indoor pools in Europe are in the
range of 300 and 800 /H9262g/m3, which makes this gas one
of the most concentrated air pollutants to which children
of developed countries are regularly exposed.1–3The air
of swimming pools, particularly just above the water’s
surface, is also contaminated by mist or aerosols laden
with hypochlorous acid, combined chlorine, and other
water-soluble chlorination byproducts, all increasing the
burden of oxidants actively inhaled by swimmers.
The acute toxicity of chlorine-based disinfectants has
been known for a long time. Case reports regularly
describe lung injuries after community accidents in in-
door swimming pools.4–7Inhalation of chlorine gas is
usually responsible for the acute lung damage that for-
tunately is usually transient with recovery of the lung
function within a period of a few weeks. The possibility
that the gaseous and aerosolized chlorination products
building up in pool air can cause chronic respiratory
effects in swimmers has, however, been acknowledged
only recently. Our investigations on children attending
indoor chlorinated swimming pools have shown that
trichloramine, together probably aerosolized hypochlo-
rous acid and chloramines, can damage the lung epithe-
lium8and promote the development of asthma, espe-
cially in atopic children.9–11These effects might lie behind
the strong ecological associations that we have recently
evidenced across Europe between childhood asthma
prevalence and the availability of indoor chlorinated
swimming pool.12Studies by other researchers con-
ﬁrmed the detrimental effects of these chemicals on the
airways of recreational swimmers,13including asthmat-
ics,14while providing additional evidence that swimming
pool attendance during infancy might contribute to the
development of allergic diseases.15
One of the most critical factors in determining the
risks of chlorination products for children seems to be
the timing of exposure. The risk of developing asthma orof lung inﬂammation as assessed on the basis of exhaled
nitric oxide (eNO) seems to culminate when children
regularly attend indoor pools before the age of 7
years.9,11A likely explanation for this higher sensitivity
of young children is that they cannot really swim before
the age of 6 or 7 years and, therefore, have to attend the
small heavily polluted pool. When playing or learning to
swim, young children probably also inhale and swallow
more aerosols and water droplets containing hypochlo-
rous acid and soluble chloramines. Another likely expla-
nation is that the lungs of very young children are still
developing, thus they are presumably more vulnerable
to the irritating effects of chlorine and its derivatives.16
These ﬁndings unavoidably raise the question of the
safety of infant swimming, especially because the higher
water temperature and the greater organic pollution in
swimming pools attended by young children are condi-
tions favoring the formation of chlorination byproducts.
In the United States, it is estimated that between 5 and
10 million infants and preschool children participate in
formal swimming instructions programs, and among
them there are probably several million individuals who
have learned swimming as infants.17Surprisingly, most
industrialized countries have popularized this practice in
the absence of reliable data concerning the possible con-
sequences of exposing infants to the toxic gases and
aerosols building up in the air of indoor pools. The only
study having addressed this issue is that of Nystad et al,18
who found that infant swimming practice was associated
with an increased risk of recurrent respiratory tract in-
fections and otitis media in the ﬁrst year of life. This
study, however, did not report data on the levels of
chlorine in the pools attended by the infants, nor did it
assess the effects of infant swimming on the develop-
ment of asthma and allergy later in childhood.
In this cross-sectional study, we compared the respi-
ratory health, allergic status, and pulmonary epithelium
integrity of school-aged children who took part in an
infant swimming program with that of their peers who
did not. Whenever possible, objective outcome measures
were used in addition to the traditional indicators of
allergic and respiratory diseases assessed by question-
naire.
MATERIALSANDMETHODS
Forty-three children having taken part in an infant
swimming program were identiﬁed in a survey that in-
volved a total of 341 schoolchildren 10 to 13 years of
age. These children were recruited in 10 primary schools
in southwestern Brussels. Levels of active and combined
chlorine in the public swimming pool attended by swim-
ming infants were within recommended limits at that
time ( /H110211.5 and 2 mg/L, respectively). Concentrations of
trichloramine in pool air, available from 2001 when the
systematic survey of this gas started in Brussels, ranged
from 170 to 540 /H9262g/m3(mean: 325 /H9262g/m3;n/H110057).

Levels of trichloramine were probably in the same range
some 10 years ago because operating conditions and
recommended limits of chlorine had remained un-
changed since the 1980s. All children were examined in
their school between March 28 and May 29, 2002, thus
outside main periods of pollination in Belgium. The pro-
tocol for examining children was described in detail
elsewhere.12Brieﬂy, after their parents had given writ-
ten informed consent, the children underwent a medical
examination that included measurement of height and
weight, collection of 1 blood sample (7 mL) after appli-
cation of an anesthetic cream (EMLA, AstraZeneca,
Karlskargo, Sweden). Asthma was screened by using the
exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) test (on the
basis of a 15% decrease of forced expiratory volume
[FEV1] after a 6-minute roundabout indoors with sub-
maximal effort),19a noninvasive test that has been found
to be predictive of clinical asthma or asthma symptoms
in several studies.20–22The examination also included the
measurement of eNO23and serum Clara cell protein
(CC16)24,25and surfactant-associated protein D (SP-D)
(SPD ELISA kit, Yamasa Corporation, Tokyo, Japan), 2
markers of the deep lung epithelium integrity.26,27Total
immunoglobulin E (IgE) and IgE against the 12 most
common aeroallergens were also measured in serum
(Immulite Total and AlatTOP; Diagnostic Products Corp,
Los Angeles, CA). Information about the respiratory
health of children (respiratory symptoms during the pre-
vious 12 months, doctor-diagnosed asthma, and recur-
rent bronchitis) and their exposure to risk factors of
asthma and allergy was obtained from the questionnaire
ﬁlled in by the parents. The ethics committee of the
Catholic University of Louvain approved the study pro-
tocol. Statistical comparison was based on the /H92732test, the
2-sided unpaired ttest, or the Mann-Whitney Utest.
Bonferroni’s correction was applied to multiple compar-
isons. Backyard multiple and logistic regression analyses
were used to assess associations between infant swim-
ming practice and outcomes. We tested a total of 23
other potential predictors, including among others gen-
der, total and aeroallergen-speciﬁc IgE, family history of
allergic diseases, maternal smoking during pregnancy,
parental smoking at home, siblings, housing density,
exposure to pets, cumulated attendance at an indoor
chlorinated pool, and the accessibility to a backyard
chlorinated pool. In multiple regression analyses, cumu-
lated pool attendance and the CC16/SP-D ratio that
were not normally distributed were normalized by log-
arithmic transformation. To enable the log transforma-
tion, we set the minimum cumulated pool attendance at
2.5 hours instead of 0 (2.5 hours was the lowest reported
cumulated pool attendance). Independent variables in
multiple regression analyses were entered at a Pvalue of
.25 and kept in the model at Pvalue /H11021.05. In logistic
regression analyses, adjustment was made for variables
remaining with a Pvalue /H11021.1. These logistic regressionanalyses were repeated on children who were exposed
to tobacco smoke during pregnancy or at home to detect
the possible interactions of these 2 factors with infant
swimming practice. Unless otherwise stated, only odds
ratios (ORs) adjusted for covariates are reported. In ad-
dition, we used 2-way analysis of variance to assess the
changes in serum pneumoproteins associated with in-
fant swimming practice, access to a backyard pool, or
with exposure to tobacco smoke during pregnancy or at
home, and the possible interactions between these fac-
tors. Statistical analyses were performed by using SAS
9.1.3 (SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, NC).
RESULTS
As shown in Table 1, children who had been swimming
as infants did not differ from their peers with respect to
age, gender, ethnicity, BMI, and family history of asthma
or hay fever. Children in the swimming infant group
were also not signiﬁcantly different from their peers
regarding birth weight, number of siblings, housing den-
sity, or proportions of children who were breastfed, at-
tended day care, or lived with pets since birth. The
proportions of children exposed to tobacco smoke at
home or who had been exposed to tobacco smoke dur-
ing pregnancy, as well as of children having access to a
backyard chlorinated pool were, however, noticeably
greater among swimming infant children. These children
also had a signiﬁcantly greater cumulated attendance at
indoor chlorinated swimming pools.
The allergic status and the markers of lung inﬂamma-
tion and epithelial integrity of children who swam as
infants and controls are compared in Table 2. Mean
levels of total serum IgE and the prevalences of IgE
speciﬁc to major aeroallergens were similar between the
2 groups. The rate of sensitization to dog-speciﬁc IgE was
higher in children in the infant swimming group, a
difference, however, that was no more statistically sig-
niﬁcant after the application of the Bonferroni’s test.
There were also no differences between the 2 groups
regarding the mean levels and prevalences of elevated
values of eNO. Most children positive in the eNO test ( n
/H1100529) were sensitized against house-dust mite allergen
(n/H1100521 [72.9%]) and aeroallergen-speciﬁc IgE ( n/H1100526
[89.7%]). Children in the infant swimming group, by
contrast, showed a signiﬁcant decrease of serum CC16
and an even more signiﬁcant decrease of the CC16/SP-D
ratio, an index integrating the damage to Clara cells and
the permeability changes of lung epithelial barrier. In
multivariate analysis, infant swimming emerged as the
only statistically signiﬁcant predictor of serum CC16
(partial r:/H110020.14; P/H11005.01), and this practice was the
strongest determinant of the CC16/SP-D ratio (log-
transformed values, partial r:/H110020.15; P/H11005.006), the
latter being also inﬂuenced by day care attendance (par-
tialr:/H110020.086; P/H11005.007), age (partial r:/H110020.058; P/H11005
.009), breastfeeding (partial r;/H110020.080; P/H11005.022), and

ethnicity (partial r: 0.087; P/H11005.024). Passive exposure to
tobacco smoke during pregnancy or at home as well as
the access to a backyard pool had thus no inﬂuence on
the serum levels of CC16 or on the serum CC16/SP-D
ratio. Analysis of the effects of infant swimming and
passive smoking on pneumoproteins by 2-way analysis
of variance conﬁrmed the decrease of serum CC16 and
CC16/SP-D ratio in children in the infant swimming
group and found no interaction between infant swim-
ming and passive smoking (all P/H11350.15).
As shown in Table 3, changes observed in serum
pneumoproteins were associated with poorer respiratory
health. Children who swam as infants showed an in-
creased risk of chest tightness. There were no statistically
signiﬁcant differences in the other respiratory symp-toms, which tended to be more prevalent in the children
in the infant swimming group. These children were also
/H110113 times more likely to be positive in the EIB test, to
have doctor diagnosed and/or EIB test-screened asthma,
and to suffer from recurrent bronchitis. Of note, the lack
of statistical signiﬁcance in the increased risk of doctor-
diagnosed asthma with infant swimming was because of
the inﬂuence of backyard pool (OR: 4.27; 95% conﬁ-
dence interval [CI]: 1.05–17.4). Indeed, removal of the
backyard pool factor from the list of predictors increased
the OR for doctor-diagnosed asthma associated with in-
fant swimming to a level that was signiﬁcantly /H110221 (OR:
2.96; 95% CI: 1.08–8.11). No signiﬁcant association
emerged between any of these outcomes or passive ex-
posure to tobacco smoke at home or during pregnancy,TABLE1 CharacteristicsofChildrenWhoSwamasInfantsandTheirControls

except for the risk of wheezing that was increased by
maternal smoking during pregnancy (OR: 2.75; 95% CI:
1.04–6.61). Passive exposure to tobacco smoke and in-
fant swimming seemed, however, to potentiate the det-
rimental effects of infant swimming practice. The OR for
asthma (doctor-diagnosed and/or screened with the EIB
test) associated with infant swimming was indeed /H110222
times greater when children were also exposed to pa-
rental smoking (OR: 6.54; 95% CI: 1.18–36.4 vs OR:
2.52; 95% CI: 0.86–7.39) although the odds for recur-
rent bronchitis associated with infant swimming was /H110224
times greater among children who had been exposed to
maternal smoking during pregnancy (OR: 6.99; 95% CI:
1.60–30.5 vs OR: 1.61; 95% CI: 0.71–3.65).
To determine whether changes in serum pneumopro-
teins were primarily because of the infant swimming
practice and not the mere consequences of asthma or
recurrent bronchitis that were more frequent in the
children in the swimming infant group, we assessed by a
2-way analysis of variance the effects of infant swim-
ming practice, total asthma or recurrent bronchitis on
serum pneumoproteins, and the possible interactions
between these factors. As illustrated in Fig 1, asthma and
recurrent bronchitis alone had no inﬂuence on the se-
rum levels of pneumoproteins, which is in sharp contrast
with the highly signiﬁcant decrease of serum CC16 and
CC16/SP-D ratio associated with infant swimming activ-
ity (P/H11021.001). This analysis clearly shows that the levels
of serum CC16 were on average the lowest among the
children in the infant swimming group who were asth-
matic or recurrently suffered from bronchitis.
DISCUSSION
Our ﬁndings show that the infant swimming practice is
associated with lung epithelium alterations that seem to
predispose children to the development of asthma andrecurrent bronchitis. These effects cannot be explained
by inherited differences in the genetic disposition to
develop these diseases, because children who swam as
infants were well matched with the others with respect
to the family history of respiratory disease, as well as to
the serum levels of total IgE. Our ﬁndings cannot be
explained either by the fact that on average the children
in the infant swimming group were more exposed to
parental smoking or to chlorine from backyard pools. In
our study, we found no evidence that infant swimming
increased the risk of respiratory allergy. There was also
no increase in the risk of airways inﬂammation as as-
sessed by the eNO test, a ﬁnding that is not surprising
given the very the close relationship between eNO and
allergic sensitization observed by us and also reported by
recent studies.28,29
As with any epidemiologic study using data from
self-administered questionnaires, our study can be prone
to recall bias. We believe, however, that it is unlikely
that our observations were generated or distorted by a
systematic bias in the parental responses to the questions
about their child’s health or swimming practice. The
strongest argument against that possibility is that the
most statistically signiﬁcant observations were made
with objective outcome measures (serum pneumopro-
teins and EIB test) that parents were not aware of when
ﬁlling the questionnaires. The parents were also blinded
to the tested hypothesis because initially the study was
not designed to look speciﬁcally at the effects of infant
swimming practice. In addition, the tested hypothesis of
adverse respiratory effects associated with infant swim-
ming is far from being common in the community. Ac-
tually, this hypothesis is just the opposite of the belief
that the parents probably have when they decide to take
their infant to swimming pool. The possibility that theyTABLE3 SwimmingInfantPractice,RespiratorySymptoms,andRisksofAsthmaandRecurrentBronchitisLaterDuringChildhood

could have biased their responses in favor of adverse
effects seems thus unlikely.
Our data suggest that the poorer respiratory health of
children who swam as infants could be linked to distal
airways damage detected by the assay of serum pneumo-
proteins. The concentration of serum CC16 is a well-vali-
dated marker of the lung epithelium barrier integrity, re-
ﬂecting either the number of Clara cells lining terminal
airways or the permeability of the alveolar-capillary barri-
er.26,27When adjusted for the level of a surfactant-associ-
ated protein, such as SP-D, the concentration of CC16
proves to be an even more sensitive marker, probably
because this ratio integrates both the damage to Clara cells
and the increased leakiness of the alveolar-blood barrier.30
A decrease in serum CC16 reﬂecting a parallel loss of Clara
cells was demonstrated in humans and in rodents acutely
or chronically exposed to a variety of lung toxicants.31For
instance, active smoking leads to a 20% to 30% decrease ofserum CC16, mirroring a parallel decrease in the number
of Clara cells.30–34A similar decrease of serum CC16 was
observed after occupational exposures to crystalline silica35
or ﬁresmoke.36The decrease of serum CC16 in children
who swam as infants averaged 20%. Thus, it is almost of
the same magnitude as that caused in adults by tobacco
smoke or industrial chemicals. If one refers to the clinical
consequences of active smoking or of occupational expo-
sures to crystalline silica and other lung irritants, it would
not be surprising that similar alterations of the respiratory
epithelium in young children could make them more
prone to develop some respiratory diseases. This interpre-
tation is also consistent with the antiinﬂammatory proper-
ties of CC16,37,38as well as with the ﬁnding that asthma39
and other respiratory diseases40are associated with lower
intrapulmonary pools of CC16 because of Clara cell dam-
age or the intravascular leakage of the protein.

swimming pool chemicals for the respiratory tract of
infants and young children, the pool factor responsible
for these airways alterations is difﬁcult to identify. We
strongly suspect, however, that the chlorination prod-
ucts that infants inhale as gases, aerosols, or even water
repeatedly damage the airway epithelium. One culprit
might be trichloramine, the highly volatile and reactive
gas formed when chlorine reacts with organic matter
brought by swimmers. This gas that gives indoor swim-
ming pools their characteristic chlorine smell was, in-
deed, found to cause asthma and pulmonary epithelium
damage in lifeguards and recreational swimmers.8–11Be-
cause their lungs are still developing, infants could be
particularly sensitive to this irritant and be affected de-
spite the rather limited time they spend in pools (usually
20–30 minutes per session). The levels of trichloramine
in the studied pool were on average below the provi-
sional 2-hour air quality guideline of 500 /H9262g/m3recently
recommended by the World Health Organization.41If
trichloramine is responsible for the respiratory effects
observed in our study, this would mean that the World
Health Organization guideline is too high and should be
lowered to be more in accordance with studies8,9show-
ing that trichloramine can disrupt the lung epithelium
barrier of swimmers at concentrations ranging from 355
to 490 /H9262g/m3. Another important route of exposure that
might cause signiﬁcant damage to infant’s lungs is the
inhalation of aerosols or of small volumes of chlorinated
water when the infants actively play or have their head
under water. Damage to the respiratory tract caused by
the inhalation of heavily chlorinated water seems espe-
cially plausible because the maximum recommended
levels for chlorine in the Brussels pool that our children
attended when they were infants were relatively high.
For instance, the recommended limit for combined chlo-
rine was 2 ppm, a concentration twice higher than the
current standard (0.8 ppm) and 10 times higher than the
standard applied in Germany (0.2 ppm).15Because in-
fants cannot control their breathing as well as when they
get older, the infant swimming practice is considered to
be safe because of the laryngeal or gag reﬂex that is
triggered when water gets into infant’s mouth. By clos-
ing off the larynx with the epiglottis, this reﬂex is sup-
posed to keep pool water from entering the lungs.42
However, the gag reﬂex, even if very effective, cannot
prevent small amounts of chlorinated water deposited or
trapped in the upper respiratory tract to be conducted
more deeply in the lungs when the infant surfaces to
breathe. Cases of hyponatremic described after dunking
infants in swimming pools43,44attest to the amount of
water that an infant can ingest and possibly inhale when
being under water. Last, one cannot exclude the possi-
bility that the inhalation of hypotonic water also causes
some epithelial changes aggravating the effects of chlo-
rination products.
Although we did not speciﬁcally interview the par-ents about this issue, our study provides some interest-
ing insights into the reasons why parents take their
infant to swimming programs. As one could expect,
prevention of drowning seems to be an important reason
because there were 5 times more children having access
to a backyard pool among the infant swimming group
than among the other children. Although drowning is a
leading cause of unintentional injury and death in chil-
dren, frequently involving backyard pools, it should be
noted that the protection offered by infant swimming
programs is much debated. According to the American
Academy of Pediatrics, there is indeed no clearcut scien-
tiﬁc evidence that the likelihood of drowning is reduced
by the participation to such programs.17The American
Academy of Pediatrics argues that until the age of 4
years, infants are not developmentally ready for formal
swimming lessons and that the participation in such
programs could give to parents a false sense of security
about their child’s skill in water. The American Academy
of Pediatrics did not consider chemical hazards, but if, as
suggested by our ﬁndings, chlorine used to disinfect
pools poses some threat to infants’ health, this would
certainly further justify a critical appraisal of infant
swimming programs. There might be, however, an even
more debatable reason encouraging parents to partici-
pate to swimming infant programs. Intriguingly, the in-
fant swimming group included a much greater propor-
tion of children who had been exposed to tobacco smoke
in utero or at home. The origin of this difference is
unclear, but we think it might reﬂect the will of the
parents to mitigate for the adverse effects of passive
smoking by giving their infant the possibility to practice
a healthy activity. The unfortunate irony is that the
result might well be just the opposite, because our study
suggests that infant swimming activity interacts with
passive smoking to greatly increase the risk of asthma or
recurrent bronchitis.
The major limitation of our study certainly lies in the
relatively small size of the infant swimming group. With
/H1102115% of Brussels schoolchildren participating in such
programs, this was the maximum sample size we could
achieve in a population-based study involving 341 chil-
dren. The alternative would be to recruit children via
infant swimming organizations. However, assuming that
these organizations would be willing to collaborate in
research exploring the risks linked to chlorinated pools,
the study would then be confronted with the difﬁculty of
avoiding response or selection bias and, above all, with
the difﬁculty of recruiting a well-matched control pop-
ulation. Fortunately, the limited statistical power of our
study was balanced by the use of sensitive outcome
measures, leading to particular strong associations that
were unlikely to be explained by chance only. The small
size of our study, however, did not enable us to draw
deﬁnitive conclusions regarding the impact of backyard
pool chlorine to which children in the infant swimming

group were more frequently exposed. Having access to a
backyard chlorinated pool emerged, indeed, as a signif-
icant predictor of doctor-diagnosed asthma, which
slightly weakened the association emerging with infant
swimming. This is clearly another unexplored area that
warrants additional research, especially because residen-
tial pools usually have higher levels of chlorine than
public pools and offer children almost unlimited oppor-
tunities for swimming during the hot season.
CONCLUSIONS
Our study shows that the infant swimming practice in
indoor chlorinated pools can be associated with airways
changes that predispose children to asthma and recur-
rent bronchitis later in childhood. Given the increasing
popularity of swimming pools, there is a deﬁnitive need
to assess the effects of chlorination products on the
respiratory tract of very young children. In the mean-
time, because in most countries these products are not as
strictly regulated and monitored as indicators of micro-
bial risks, we can only recommend caution before regu-
larly taking infants to poorly maintained swimming
pools with excessive levels of chlorine in the water and
in the air.

THEMOMMYTRACK
“Why do women fall off academia’s science track at a faster clip than men?
The cause is not innate sex differences, a new study suggests, but neither is it
a simple matter of gender discrimination. If a problem exists, the authors
conclude, it’s about motherhood, not women in general. Using the 1973–
2001 Survey of Doctorate Recipients, the study found that while women are
less likely than men to enter tenure-track positions in the sciences, the
difference is explained completely by ‘fertility decisions.’ Single, childless
women are between 11 percent (in the life sciences) and 21 percent (in the
physical sciences) more likely to have a tenure-track job within ﬁve years of
ﬁnishing their doctorate than single, childless men. . . . Children can hurt a
woman’s chances signiﬁcantly: Having a child at pre-kindergarten age took 8
percentage points off a woman’s chance of getting that tenure-track job.”
