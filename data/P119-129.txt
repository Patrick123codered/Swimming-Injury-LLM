1. Introduction 
The practice of teaching differs from fields of  study and countries by countries. The pedagogy 
includes how the teacher interacts with students, teaching strategies, teacher actions, teaching materials by showing theories of learning, unde rstandings of students and their needs, and 
interests of individual students. The authors are teaching swimming courses at the School of 
Health and Sports Sciences, the Mukogawa Women’ s University in Japan. In order to understand 
the American methods of practice of teaching in swimming classes, this pa per is to research and 
demonstrate the current swimming courses taking place at the Department of Health Exercise and Sports Science, the University of New Mexico in United States of America. This case report 
shows that today’s university swimming classes’ teaching methods and materials, such as 
syllabus, course objectives, re quirements and policy of Ph ysical Education Program.

highly qualified teachers and co mmunity leaders in health education and physical education; 
qualified professionals in athlet ic training; and qualified health/fitness instructors for fitness 
centers, corporate fitness pr ograms, outpatient physical therapy, and cardiopulmonary 
rehabilitation programs . The graduate students include te achers wishing to improve their 
practice or move into a career in higher educ ation as a university pr ofessor; professionals 
preparing to move into leadership positions in community, public health or worksite settings, high school, college, or professional sports; exercise scientists prepar ing to become researchers, and 
preventative and/or rehabili tative program directors. 
The curricula offered in the prog ram foster understanding in fi ve areas, which are Athletic 
Training, Exercise Science, Health Education/Promotion, Physical Education, and Sport 
Administration at HESS.

. Physical Education Non-Professional Program (PENP) at UNM HESS 
Physical Education Non-Professional Progra m (PENP) at UNM HESS offered the three 
courses of swimming, which are Beginning Swim ming, Intermediate Swimming, and Advanced 
Swimming at fall semester 2017. PENP is designed to provide st udents with the e ssential skills, 
knowledge and attitudes necessary to sustain regula r, lifelong physical ac tivity as a foundation 
for a healthy, productive and fulfilling life. Th e learning experiences are designed to promote 
personal enrichment of all part icipating students in a carefull y planned, comprehensive, and 
innovative environment th at promotes self-discipline, self-evaluation and an understanding of 
personal strengths and weaknesses. It is an in tegral part of the total education process and 
significantly contributes in the areas of affective, cognitive and psychomotor development, along with health-related fitness. Under the basic Inst ruction Program at Physical Education, these 
following classes are the course  description. PENP 101; Beginning Swimming class instructs 
students who have not been in the water or ha ve a fear of water. PENP 102; Intermediate 
Swimming class teaches in all basic strokes for students who can swim. PENP 103; Advanced 
Swimming class demonstrates and practices in perfecting all swimming strokes; competitive skills; and synchronized skills.

 6. Course requirements and policies   
PENP 101 is a Beginning Swimming course for 50 minutes, twice a week, taking place at 
Johnson Olympic Pool, and instructor is PhD students at UNM HESS in Physical Education 
Program. The objective of this course is to get ri d of fear from water for beginners, enhance fitness 
through swimming and complete 50-meter swim in Freestyle. 
Attendance is a biggest part of the grading for th is course, therefore, there is a detail list of 
requirements for passing the class. The punctuality is very imperative for students, so the most 
important policy is to be on time. If students get there after this time, they are tardy, and if they 
get to class after 10 minutes class starts, they are absent. Students need to check in and out with the instructor each class. Check in process starts five minutes prior to the class starts until on 
time. If students arrived after th e time class started, they are tardy. Two tardiness equals one 
absence. Students dressed appropriately with swimming trunks on for men and a one-piece 
bathing suit on for women as well as goggles and caps for those whose hair is at or longer than their shoulder. 
Health Education, and Sports Science policy fo r any 16-week course states that any student 
with more than 6 absences is to be automaticall y dropped from the course. Absences resulting 
from extenuating circumstances must be addres sed through the Dean of Students Office or 
Student Health Center and may be made up  at the discretion of the instructor.

. Teaching methods 
Among all those physical education courses that UNM offered, swimming classes is one of the 
most popular sports courses. Since the swimming can be a lifetime exercise that most people can enjoy 
at all time. Swimming is considered one of the best  workouts in health wellness program. As water is 
denser than air, swimming presents greater resistan ce to the body, which are the better drill for one’s 
shoulders, hips, core and arms. Swimming is also ph ysically and mentally ther apeutic. Water provides 
good resistance training, especially for the muscle s that normally do not get a proper workout, like 
deltoid, where is the rounded muscles on the contours of the shoulders. Swimming is one of the top 
remedial exercises. Therefore, if students are reco vering from an injury or nursing sore muscles, 
swimming is a great way to get back to the usual training pace. 
Beginning Swimming classes offered to students wh o want to get rid of the fear of water as well 
as to get used to the water for safety reasons. They  learn to control their body  in water to be able to 
swim with freestyle. The block plan calendar indicates 16 weeks of teaching method curriculum for the 
class (Appendix A). Intermediate Swimming classes offered some techniques for four strokes, which 
are butterfly, backstroke, breastst roke, and freestyle. They learn how to swim longer distance with 
those four strokes with gaining swimming enduranc e. Advanced swimming classes are focused on 
improving fast swimming time, and sometimes stud ents are competing at swim meets and triathlon 
competitions.        
One of the common teaching contents and very im perative aspects in all level swimming classes 
is kicking. As the kicking motion in the water, whic h is 800 times denser than air, you are able to train 
students and their quads, hamstrings and gluteus. Also, as swimming requir es infrequent breathing 
−121−
 during lengthens, the body learns to use oxygen  efficiently for better overall health, and builds 
endurance. Students who take all three level courses, necessary ski lls for swimming will be developed. 
Therefore, these trainings in each class help stud ents who want to swim in several different swim 
styles and longer distance, are recovering from injury, and the programs support preventing from 
health problems.   
For those physical education program materials show not only class teaching methods, but 
also include strict policies such as safety warn ings, special needs, academic dishonesty, and Title 
IX. It is very crucial for those students who are in  classes can see visually those policies (Appendix 
B). By showing those policies are mutually benefici al for instructors and students to prevent from 
any negative circumstances during instructing semester.  
 
8. Conclusion 
University swimming classes in the United States are consist of  different levels of skillsets 
that students have and their needs. From beginning to advanced classes, students will be able to gain the essential techniques, swimming performanc e, and enhancement of overall fitness level to 
sustain healthy, productive and fulfilling physical activity. The programs are comprehensively 
developed with injury prevention, health wellness, and swimming skills. Therefore, students will 
learn to promote their personal enrichment, self-d iscipline, self- evaluati on and an understanding 
of personal strengths and weaknesses. 
Most of the Physical Education programs which are including those swimming classes are 
instructed by PhD students. Teaching assistant system is a part of their graduation requirements, and the practice of learning is to gain the ex perience in education. The teaching experiences 
provide entrance of professional career in higher institutions. Physical Education programs in the 
US is an integral part of the total education pr ocess and significantly cont ribute to the areas of 
human development and leadership development along with health-related fitness.  
At last, the important academic policy the US university swimming classes shows that 
include the policy of civil rights to interact with students. Especially, the syllabus (Appendix B) illustrated the policy of Title IX of Education Amendment to provide the support system for 
instructors and students in or der to prevent from any gender discrimination or sexual 
harassment.  
To conclude, the pedagogy of swimming courses at the US university provides opportunities 
to learn the knowledge of physical education for va st students in different conditions and interests 
of individuals.
