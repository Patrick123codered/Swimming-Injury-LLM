Abstract : The aim of this research was to examine and point out the prevention of sports injuries in swimmers. Swimming training 
involves repetitive movementsshoulders that provide propulsive forces by using the arms as oars to propel the body through th e 
water.Over training in swimming causes muscle fatigue that can lead to reduced rotator cuff efficiency and ineffective positioning of 
the scapula during each stroke. Another major risk factor for swimmers and shoulder injury is muscle imbalance that leads to 
shoulder  instability, which results from ligamentous laxity and increased range of motion. the most commonly used are:external 
rotation,lifting a full bucket, raising arms with a full bucket,ball to the wall, rowing with an elastic band, auto -stopper, push -ups 
with one addition. It can be concluded that coaches have a very big role in recognizing, but also in the preventive action of sh oulder 
injuries through monitoring the training load, correcting certain segments of swimming technique (swimming stroke), as well as 
strengthening and muscle stretching in the so -called "dry" training for swimmers.  
Keywords  - swimming, stroke, shoulder joint, injuries, prevention  
INTRODUCTION  
Tens of millions of people participate and enjoy various sports as individual sports[1 -3]. as well as collective [4 -7]. Swimming as 
an individual and at the same time void sport is an extremely popular recreational and competitive sport [8]. Health effects are caused 
by versatile demands on the entire musculoskeletal, cardiovascular and respirat ory systems. Participating in sports is a good way to 
maintain a level of physical fitness, but it can sometimes lead to injury. Modern training and competitions represent a great  effort 
for the athlete's body [8]. In the desire to achieve the best possibl e result, the athlete does his best, not considering the danger of 
injuries that threaten him in the process [7].  
The risk of injury in any sport is regulated by its nature and, among others, that risk is an integral part of participating in competitions. 
Sports injuries occupy a high place in the order of frequency of injuries in the modern world. That is why prevention is of g reat 
importance. A large number of sports injuries occur due to overloading of muscles, tendons or ligaments.The term sports injur ies 
refers to injuries that are most often caused by the effect of mechanical force, during any sports activity [9].  
The most common causes of injuries are: overtraining (local muscle fatigue leads to weakening of shoulder joint stabilization ); 
improperly a dopted swimming technique (which does not sufficiently reduce the frontal resistance, which is an additional load for 
the shoulder muscles that carry out thrust); Abdominal muscle weakness (because strong and well -controlled abdominal muscles 
enable good r otation around the longitudinal axis of the trunk when swimming, which makes it easier for the shoulder muscles to 
remove the arm from the water at the end of the push movement); breathing technique only on one side (this leads to muscle 
asymmetry, followe d by their inadequate activation and overload)[5,8,10].  
Swimming is the ability to maintain the body on the surface of the water and the ability to move in the water with appropriat e 
movements of the arms, legs and body [11].. It is a non -contact sport tha t involves a lot of upper body strength. Research into sports 
injuries confirms that recreational swimmers have a very low risk of injury [4,5,11]. Swimming is one of the sports with a ve ry low 
frequency of traumatic injuries. Muscle imbalances can lead to  injuries, especially in the shoulder [8]. Also, the high intensity of 
training used by top swimmers almost inevitably makes them vulnerable and susceptible to overexertion syndrome. Where trainin g 
is intense, these factors can contribute to shoulder injur y and pain. Therefore, it should come as no surprise that shoulder pain is one 
of the leading injuries among competitive swimmers. Therefore, the goal of this research was to examine and point out the pre vention 
of sports injuries in swimmers.  
THEORETICAL CONSIDERATION OF THE PROBLEM

187 The subject of study in sports science ismovementas individual and the basic manifestation of movement, that is, as a complex  and 
complex manifestation human motor skills [16,17]. Movement, that is, movement, c annot be achieved without muscle system. The 
basic property of muscles is the ability to contract. A muscle can to achieve a contraction without manifest consequential mo vement, 
i.e. to achieve contraction in the isometric (static) mode of stress, and can achieve contraction with consequent manifest movement, 
i.e. achieve contraction in dynamic mode of stress: eccentric, concentric or combined [18 -20]. 
In addition to training in water, swimmers also apply training on dry land, the goal of which is the devel opment of general and 
targeted physical preparation of swimmers [11]. Today, exercises that develop motor skills are increasingly applied [13,14]. The 
physical preparation of swimmers can be divided into: general (involves developing the strength of all mu scle groups regardless of 
the specifics of the swimming discipline), directed (developing the strength of those muscle groups that are represented in t he 
performance of competitive movements, but those exercises must imitate their structure and impact on t he body competitive 
movement) and specific (strength development exclusively through performing competitive movement in water) [13,14].  
Achieving a high level of muscle strength is necessary in every sport, including swimming [9,15,21]. For the successful 
implementation of a swimming race, a swimmer must possess: maximum strength, speed strength and strength endurance [8,22]. To  
develop muscle strength in swimmers, the following are used: isometric, dynamic, isokinetic and plyometric training [11]. The  best 
results, i.e. the greatest impact on swimming efficiency, have strength exercises performed in water and directed strength ex ercises 
on dry land. In the preparatory period, classic strength training with load is used more, while in the later stages of pre paration, 
directed exercises on dry land are increasingly used in combination with specific exercises for developing strength in water 
[15,18,22]. The experimental treatment of this research contains directed exercises on dry land and specific exercises fo r developing 
strength in water.  
PAINFUL SHOULDER  
Competitive swimming is a very popular and demanding sport [8].It has been included in the program of the Olympic Games since  
1869. Due to their popularity, top swimmers start their careers already at the ag e of seven, in some literature it is even mentioned 
that they start at the age of 5 or 6 [8,20], and most of them train and participate in competitions throughout the year.The t ime devoted 
to training in competitive swimming can range from at least five to  30 hours per week.Swimming training involves repetitive 
movements. In a typical two -hour training session, an elite swimmer can swim between 6,000 and 7,000 meters. That swimming is 
on average about 35km - 65km per week, which is equivalent to aerobic run ning 130km - 260km. This means that swimmers perform 
between 1,500 and 4,000 arm strokes per day, or about 1,000,000 arm strokes per year [13].Since female swimmers, on average, 
have a shorter arm stroke, they can perform an additional 660,000 stroke cycle s per year.In swimming, speed depends on the arms, 
especially the adductors and external rotators of the shoulder. Because of this, the shoulder joint is the main site of overe xertion 
syndrome.Over a million rotations are performed in the shoulder annually , so it is easy to understand why there are so many shoulder 
injuries in swimmers [8,14], respectively90% of swimmers' complaints are about shoulder injuries [10].  
The shoulders provide propulsive forces by using the arms as oars to propel the body through  the water,and shoulder pain is a 
common occurrence in swimmers [22]. Johnson (2003) reported that shoulder injuries account for about 30% of all swimming 
injuries, followed by back injuries for 20%, and knee injuries for 10% of all swimming injuries.[23].  The term "Swimmer's shoulder" 
was first described by Kennedy & Hawkins in 1978 as a general painful syndrome of the shoulder joint in 
swimmers.[24].ResearchMcMaster et al. (1998) showed that 35% of senior national team and Olympic swimmers experienced 
shoulder pain that prevented them from training effectively [25].  
Overtraining in swimming causes muscle fatigue which can lead to reduced rotator cuff efficiency and ineffective positioning of the 
scapula during each stroke. The causes of shoulder pain depen d on many factors and include gender, swimming experience, length 
of training, type of stroke, training intensity, upper extremity weight training, stretching (especially when working with a partner) 
and use of swim paddles [9 -11]. 
  Puckree and Thomas (20 06) conducted a study to determine the incidence of shoulder injuries in competitive swimmers in 
KwaZulu -Natal, a province in South Africa. A cross -sectional study was conducted. A random sample of 96 swimmers from a group 
of 300 swimmers registered in the  first division of KwaZulu - National Swimming Federation clubs participated in the study, and all 
voluntarily agreed. Data were collected using a valid questionnaire. Seventy -one percent of swimmers had shoulder pain and 64% 
reported shoulder injuries. Fo rty-six percent of swimmers complained of pain in the front of the shoulder, while 65% of all injuries 
were due to overtraining. The most common diagnoses are tendinitis (35%), muscle imbalance (29%), and other (17%). Sixty -nine 
percent of swimmers swim cr awl, which is associated with 70% of injuries. Eighty -one percent of injured swimmers sought 
physiotherapy for shoulder pain. The authors conclude that the frequency of shoulder injuries in competitors is high [26].  
Standardized clinical examination of the  shoulder and glenohumeral joint laxity testing using a non -invasive electronic lactometer. 
52/80 swimmers underwent MRI (magnetic resonance imaging). The results obtained by the authors indicate that 73/80 swimmers 
reported shoulder pain. 69% of those exa mined with MRI had supraspinatus tendinopathy. The conclusions of the study indicate that 
supraspinatus tendinopathy is the main cause of shoulder pain in swimmers and that this injury is caused by high volumes of t raining 
[27].  
PREVENTION OF SHOULDER INJU RIES IN SWIMMERS

188 Coaches are not only an integral part in recognizing the early indicators of these injuries, but they can help in prevention by 
monitoring the training load, but they should pay special attention to the mechanics of the swimming stroke, tr aining with weights 
or other dry training for swimmers [26].There are ways to prevent overexertion syndrome in swimmers. Increasing shoulder stab ility 
and muscle imbalance is a key factor in reducing the incidence of shoulder injuries. Rowing rotator cuff exercises and scapular 
positioning will be credited with reducing injuries. Pay attention to proper techniques and, if injured, it is most effective  to practice 
on a cross machine [9,10].  
There are simple strategies swimming coaches can implement to reduce  injury rates:  
 The first factor is the correction of the swimming stroke, i.e. the correction of incorrect stroke mechanics is essential for  the 
prevention of injuries [11].  
 Second, training loads, i.e. total reductions in weekly training mileage, and th is will not be possible from a physiological 
point of view. However, coaches can help by reducing shoulder stress during each week by setting tasks that will relieve the shoulders 
(eg, relaxation exercises, active arm recovery) and maximizing the use of fi ns in the warm -up and final part of the turn [11].  
 Third, Screening, athletes at higher risk for injury can be identified during musculoskeletal screening. Individualized 
exercise programs that may be prescribed include stretching for areas of insufficien t flexibility and strengthening/stabilization for 
hyper -mobility. It is important that the screening is carried out by a physiotherapist trained in specific swimming screening proto cols 
[11,28].  
 ChFourth, Strengthening and Stretching, a comprehensive dry strength training program incorporating rotator cuff and 
scapular stabilization exercises is recommended for all swimmers. Swimmers should regularly stretch in areas of insufficient 
flexibility during screening(Walker, H. et al. 2005; Yanai, & Hay, 2000). Strengthening should concentrate on the rotator cuff and 
scapular muscles. This is best done with formal training that focuses on these muscles with light weights, high repetitions. Good 
mobility enables the swimmer to perform the necessary movements more simply and easily and helps prevent injuries [9,11,28].  
Kluemper, Uhl and Hazelriggin this study determined whether a training program would reduce the forward shoulder 
position.Participants in the study were 39 swimmers (age 16±2 years), divided into an e xercise group (n=24) and a control group 
(n=15). The experimental group performed an anterior shoulder muscle stretching program with a partner and a posterior should er 
muscle group strengthening regimen for 6 weeks. The control group participated in stand ard swimming activities in the water. The 
experimental group significantly reduced the distance of the acromion from the wall in the resting position ( -9.6 ± 7.3 mm) compared 
to the control group ( -2.0 ± 6.9 mm) [29].  
PRIMARY EXERCISES OF THE MUSCLES AND TENDONS OF THE ROTATOR CUFFAND 
STABILIZATION OF THE SHOVEL  
Because the shoulder is characterized by joint and flexion instability, muscle strength and stiffness are critical to maintai ning 
stability, proper movement, and pain -free function. The risk of injury and pain becomes serious and real [30 -32], especially in 
swimmers who swim with poor technique. It is well known and certainly already proven that an extensive program of developing 
strength and muscle flexibility is the most important way to preven t "swimmer's shoulder" injuries [10]. The primary exercises for 
the muscles and tendons of the rotator cuff and scapula stabilization are as follows [8 -11]: 
Exercise 1 – External rotation,  
Exercise 2 - Lifting a full bucket / raising arms with a full bucke t, 
Exercise 3 - Ball to the wall,  
Exercise 4 - Rowing with an elastic band,  
Exercise 5 - Stopwatch,  
Exercise 6 - Push -ups with one addition.  
CONCLUSION  
In order to achieve a maximum good result, the coaches draw the maximum from their swimmers. Considering  that the shoulder 
joint is the most mobile in swimmers, it is also the most likely to be injured. That's why coaches in the process have a very  big role 
in recognizing, but also in the preventive action of shoulder injuries through monitoring the training  load, correcting certain segments 
of swimming technique (swimming stroke), as well as strengthening and stretching the muscles in the so -called "dry" training for 
swimmers. The shoulder joint should be brought to such a state that it is strong enough to b ear heavy training loads and maximally 
mobile in order to contribute to the large amplitude of movements that are very important in the swimming sport. The paper de scribes 
exercises for strengthening the muscles of the rotator cuff and the muscles that sta bilize the scapula, all with the aim of preventing 
shoulder injuries in swimmers.
