Aim: To synthesize and assess the literature for shoulder pain and injury risk fac-
tors in competitive swimmers.
Design: Systematic review with best- evidence synthesis.
Data Sources: CINHAL, SportDiscus, Scorpus, PubMed, and Embase databases 
from 1966 to April 30 2022.
Search and Inclusion: Cohort, cross- sectional, and case– control studies in-
vestigating shoulder pain or injury risk factors in competitive swimmers were 
included. Quality of eligible studies were assessed using a modified Newcastle– 
Ottawa scale. Risk factors were divided into four categories: modifiable- intrinsic, 
modifiable- extrinsic, non- modifiable, and other/secondary.
Results: Of 1356 studies identified, 24 full texts were evaluated for methodo-
logical quality, 22 met the criteria and were included in best evidence synthesis. 
There was no strong evidence supporting or refuting the association between 80 
assessed variables and shoulder injury or pain. The swimmers' competitive level 
(nondirectional), and shoulder muscle recruitment profiles (e.g., increased activ-
ity of serratus anterior) exhibited moderate evidence supporting an association. 
Conversely, internal and external range of motion, middle finger back scratch 
test, training frequency, specialty stroke, height/weight, sex, and age all had 
moderate evidence opposing an association. Limited evidence was found for 58 
variables, and conflicting for 8. The highest quality study (n = 201) suggested high 
acute- to- chronic workload ratio and reduced posterior shoulder strength endur-
ance are associated with injury.
Conclusions: Due to the paucity of high- quality studies, future prospective stud-
ies are needed to reevaluate known risk factor associations over exploring ad-
ditional potential risk factors. Swimming practitioners should be aware of the 
nondirectional association of a swimmer's competitive level and pain, as squad 
changes could impact injury incidence. Moreover, swimmers experiencing 
shoulder pain may show increased activity in shoulder stabilizers during specific

1 | INTRODUCTION
Swimming is popular as both a form of recreational exer -
cise1,2 and as a competitive sport, with over 22 000 swim-
mers competing in the National (American) Collegiate 
Athletic Association 2021– 2022 season.3 As a form of 
recreation or exercise, swimming has numerous health 
benefits with relatively minimal stress/load on bones and 
joints,4,5 making it a popular activity for all ages.6 However, 
competitive swimming involves consistently high training 
volumes and intensities, increasing the risk of injury.7
Notwithstanding swimming's benefits, shoulder pain 
and injury prevalence and incidence is high in competitive 
swimmers. Injuries in competitive swimmers are typically 
ascribed to repetitive tissue strain.8 This is understandable 
given that these athletes perform thousands of shoulder 
revolutions each session for 10– 12 sessions/week,9 with 
some swimmers covering up to 110 km/week.7 While in-
juries are observed in the knee, lower back, and hip, the 
shoulder is undoubtedly the predominant location of pain 
and injury in competitive swimmers.10
A recent review of injury in competitive swimmers 
reported a total- body injury incidence of 2.6– 3.0 inju-
ries per 1000 h of swimming and a shoulder-  specific in-
jury prevalence of 23%– 51% and 33%– 41% in men and 
women respectively.10 Further, previous research shows 
self- reported shoulder pain in up to 97% of college- level 
swimmers (n = 30; 17M, 13F) during strenuous exercise11 
and 91% of elite junior competitors (n = 80; 42M, 38F) 
over a 1- month period.7 Despite advancements in sports 
science and rehabilitation, including improved under -
standing of intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors, shoulder 
pain and injury prevalence in competitive swimmers has 
not decreased suggesting missing or misunderstood risk 
factors. There may even be a rising trend for shoulder inju-
ries given reports of a prevalence of 26% in 1993,12 34% in 
2002,13 and 38% in 2012.14 These consistently high injury 
rates warrant further investigation into identifying risk 
factors to guide athlete screening/monitoring and injury 
prevention programs.
There is a growing body of evidence identifying pain 
and injury risk factors. Struyf et al.15 reviewed the dif-
ferences musculoskeletal dysfunctions in injured and 
non- injured swimmer's shoulders. They suggested four 
key areas for clinicians to be aware of when assessing and treating a swimmer's shoulder: (i) shoulder range of 
motion (ROM), (ii) shoulder laxity and instability, (iii) 
shoulder posture, and (iv) scapular dyskinesis. Hill et al.16 
previously conducted a review of shoulder pain and in-
jury risk factors, identifying 18 risk factors, which were 
categorized into four groups: (i) shoulder joint anatomy 
and strength, (ii) activity history, (iii) demographics, and 
(iv) musculoskeletal determinants. This 2015 review in-
cluded three prospective studies14,17,18; however, since this 
review an additional six prospective studies (n = 457)19– 24 
have been published and should be considered to fur -
ther our understanding of shoulder injury risk factors in 
swimmers. There is a clear need to synthesize these data 
to aid practitioners in their athlete screening and injury 
prevention strategies. Therefore, this review aims to sys -
tematically synthesize the current literature and provide 
an update on shoulder pain and injury risk factors in com-
petitive swimmers.
2 | METHODS
This systematic review was conducted in accordance with 
the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and 
Meta- Analyses (PRISMA)25 and registered on PROSPERO 
(CRD42021234093).
2.1 | Eligibility criteria
Original cohort, cross- sectional, and case– control stud-
ies, published in English were included in this review. 
To be included, studies must (i) include competitive 
swimmers aged from 10 to 40 years, this included any 
article that stated their sample was “competitive”, (ii) 
provide a definition of pain/injury (use of a valid pain-  
scale tool or a positive orthopedic test were accepted), 
(iii) report an outcome measure including at least one 
potential shoulder pain or injury risk factor, (iv) use in-
ferential statistics, and (v) in the event of multi- injury/
sport studies were only included if shoulder data spe-
cific to swimming was presented in isolation. Studies 
were excluded if they: (i) did not include competitive 
swimmers, (ii) if nonconservative/surgical interventions 
were applied, (iii) involved participants with medical movements. Importantly, shoulder strength- endurance may be the most clini-
cally relevant modifiable intrinsic risk factor.

conditions without reference to the shoulder, or (iv) in-
volved cadavers and animal specimens.
2.2 | Literature search strategy
A librarian assisted with developing the electronic search 
strategy. Potentially relevant studies were identified 
through searching in CINHAL, SportDiscus, Scorpus, 
PubMed, and Embase databases between 1966 and April 
2022 by two authors (S- A.L. and S.D.). The main search 
strings were “shoulder” AND “pain” OR “injur*” AND 
“competitive swim” (swim*) AND “risk factor*” (see online 
supplementary material S1 for full list). Synonyms, Medical 
Subject Headings (MeSH), Emtree terms, and major con-
cepts derived from the main terms were used to refine our 
findings. Reference lists of all studies were reviewed for ad-
ditional studies not found in the original search.
2.3 | Study selection
Articles from the initial database search results were im-
ported into Endnote and duplicates removed. Remaining 
articles were imported into Rayyan, with two reviewers 
blinded before screening all titles and abstracts based 
on the eligibility criteria. In the event of disagreement, 
a third independent reviewer (S.D.) assisted to reach 
consensus.
2.4 | Study quality appraisal/risk of bias
Prior to quality assessment of all articles, six articles were 
chosen at random for independent evaluation to ensure 
all screening items were clear and understood by three 
reviewers (A.M., S- A.L., and S.D.). All disagreements 
were discussed and clarified as a group before quality as-
sessment was conducted. Next, two reviewers (A.M. and 
S- A.L.) independently evaluated all articles with discrep-
ancies mediated by a third researcher (S.D.).
Quality assessment of all articles was conducted using 
a modified Newcastle–  Ottawa Scale.26 This scale has pre -
viously been used when appraising risk of bias in shoulder 
injury risk factors in other sporting populations.27– 29 The 
scale was modified to adjust to the specificity of the review 
question of interest (online supplementary material S2). 
Case–  control and cohort studies were evaluated on a nine- 
item scale, with a maximum score of 12, whereas cross- 
sectional studies were evaluated on a seven- item scale 
with a maximum score of 10.
Overall method quality was categorized using either 
high, acceptable, borderline, or unacceptable quality (Table  1). To be included in the analysis a minimum score 
of >33% of scale items was required, meaning that if a 
study did not satisfy at least 4 out of 12 (cohort and case 
control studies) or 4 out of 10 (cross-  sectional studies) 
quality criteria, they were excluded from analysis. This 
method quality scoring was adopted and modified based 
on a previous systematic review on shoulder injury risk 
factors.30
2.5 | Data extraction
Two authors (A.H. and S.D.) extracted half of the data into 
online supplementary material S1 which was then cross- 
checked (A.M.). Risk factors were categorized into one of 
four: (i) modifiable- intrinsic, (ii) modifiable- extrinsic, (iii) 
non- modifiable, and (iv) other/secondary risk factors and 
defined as follows:
 (i) Modifiable- intrinsic— any outcome measure with a 
demonstrated ability to change over time, that are 
measured on or within the individual (e.g., strength 
and range of motion (ROM)).
 (ii) Modifiable-  extrinsic— any outcome measure with a 
demonstrated ability to change over time, that are 
measured external to the individual, or work per -
formed by an individual (e.g., training load).
 (iii) Non- modifiable— any measure that has no demon-
strated ability to change over time (e.g., injury 
history).
 (iv) Other/secondary— any measure that is potentially 
modifiable but lacks strong evidence regarding their 
modification (e.g., scapula position).
2.6 | Synthesis of results
This study used best evidence synthesis31 as an alternative 
to meta- analysis due to the heterogeneity in outcome meas-
ures. This method has been used in the past to present the 
direction and strength of investigated risk factors.30 All risk 
factors were provided an evidence strength, and a direc-
tion of association. The strength of evidence was calculated 
using the criteria previously applied to suit risk factors in 
overhead sports,30 Table  2 describes these criteria. The 
direction of association was indicated using either “for”, 
meaning the evidence supports an association, or “against” 
meaning the evidence does not support an association.
Several articles reported significant associations in 
a sub-  sample (i.e., different age ranges, or male vs. fe -
male) of their study.7,23,24,32 The synthesized results re -
ported in Table  4 only report associations found overall, 
with all significant associations found in subsamples

reported in- text. Two articles only reported associations 
in subsamples of their data, with no analyses of the total 
data presented. When associations were not reported 
consistently across subgroups, that is, significant associ-
ations in one age group but not another, the authors of 
the original research were contacted and asked to pro -
vide their data to allow reanalysis following the methods 
as described originally (i.e., pooled data rather than in 
arbitrary age groups).
3 | RESULTS
3.1 | Study selection
From the database search, a total of 1356 studies were 
identified. After removing duplicates and excluding studies not addressing the objective of our review, 55 
studies remained and were screened based on inclu-
sion criteria. Reference lists of the relevant papers were 
screened, and 5 additional studies were identified and 
assessed. A total of 24 papers were evaluated for quality, 
with 22 of these included in the best- evidence synthesis 
(Figure  1).

high quality and half of the included articles were bor-
derline, using modified best evidence synthesis criteria.30 
Both muscle recruitment (via surface electromyography 
[sEMG]) and the swimmer's competitive level had mod-
erate evidence to support an association with shoulder 
pain or injury. However, there was no direction of asso-
ciation in the swimmers' competitive level, meaning that 
some studies indicated a higher injury incidence in elite 
swimmers whereas others indicated a higher incidence 
in sub- elite swimmers (Table  4). This is likely a result of 
different training practices of coaches. Similarly, various inconsistent findings were reported regarding muscle 
activity in injured swimmers compared to non- injured 
swimmers. Importantly, no study has investigated mus-
cle activity using in- water sEMG, rather opting for non- 
ecological tasks. Further, while studies consistently report 
differences in either sEMG amplitude or onset timing, the 
exact measures have not been replicated between studies. 
For example, during a standardized functional upper limb 
task Hidalgo- Lozano et al.41 reported increased activity of 
scalene bilaterally in injured swimmers but no changes 
in upper trapezius. Conversely, Sabzehparvar et al.43 re-
ported increased upper trapezius, serratus anterior, and 
latissimus dorsi, but not of middle or lower trapezius (fur-
ther discussion can be found in Section 4.4).
This review also found a moderate level of evidence 
against the associations of several measures: external and 
internal rotational ROM, middle finger distance (back- 
scratch) test, weight, training frequency (sessions/week), 
freestyle as a swimmers' specialty stroke, height, and sex. 
Meta- analysis of data was not possible due to the hetero -
geneity of studies including the lack of consistency in 
shoulder pain or injury definitions and limited risk factor 
reappraisal. Further, when risk factors were reappraised 
researchers often used alternative methods such as differ -
ent speeds for the same isokinetic strength test. Overall, 
this review highlights the dearth of high-  quality research 
investigating possible shoulder injury risk factors in com-
petitive swimmers. We also highlight measures which 
may, and may not, be relevant in swimmer screening pro -
grams and future research.
4.1 | Modifiable- intrinsic risk factors
The literature has examined modifiable- intrinsic risk 
factors across four key areas, related to: ROM, isomet-
ric shoulder strength, isokinetic shoulder strength, and 
other (non- shoulder) strength and strength endurance. 
However, no modifiable- intrinsic risk factor had greater 
than limited evidence in support.
Improving shoulder ROM appears to be a common 
focus in competitive swimming training and injury pre -
vention programs, evidenced by the 12 articles included 
in this review that investigated a ROM measure. While 
several individual studies report significant associations 
between ROM and shoulder pain or injury,7,14,19,21,24,34,37 
the best evidence synthesis suggests the literature does 
not support an association with any ROM measure. Of 
the 13 ROM measures investigated, 35 statistical tests of 
association were conducted, with only 8 reporting a signif-
icant association. There is conflicting evidence regarding 
the associations of pectoralis minor length, horizontal ab -
duction ROM, glenohumeral laxity, and shoulder rotation TABLE 3 Study scores for risk of bias and overall method

McKENZIE et al.
width and injury. With regards to studies reporting associ-
ations, several interesting findings should be highlighted. 
In a prospective cohort study Walker et al.14 identified an 
increased risk of injury in swimmers with glenohumeral 
external rotational ROM <93° and ≥100°,14 suggesting 
there is an optimal window of flexibility. Bansal et al.34 
also reported greater rotational ROM in injured swimmers 
in a cross-  sectional study; however, eight other studies 
reported no association (Table  4). Further, when assess -
ing males and females separately in a prospective study, 
Mise et al.24 reported decreased shoulder rotation width 
in males, and increased width in females were associ-
ated with shoulder pain. Shoulder rotation width is a test 
whereby the swimmer grasps a rod with both arms in full 
elbow extension, the minimum hand- to- hand distance the 
swimmer can move the rod from in front of their torso 
to behind their torso is the score they receive. A smaller 
distance indicates greater shoulder complex mobility. 
Additionally, Mise et al.24 also found that decreased exter -
nal rotation ROM was associated with pain in males' right 
but not left shoulders, and not in either female shoulder. 
No statistical association was found in the combined data 
in the left and right shoulders of males and females, as 
presented in Table  4. The pragmatism of identifying dif-
ferent risk factors between left and right shoulder is 
questionable, particularly when these findings are not re -
produced across sexes. It could be argued that breathing 
side may influence shoulder kinematics and thereby alter 
risk between shoulders; however, unilateral breathing has 
been assessed and found not to be associated with shoul-
der pain.32 Finally, while glenohumeral laxity was not as -
sociated with shoulder injury,7,22 Sein et al.7 did find joint 
laxity to be associated with impingement and extreme 
pain. However, these authors concluded that as joint lax -
ity was not associated with training load, it is likely not 
a main contributor to shoulder pain. Future work should be directed toward investigating the ROM with conflicting 
evidence.
Improving shoulder strength is also a common focus 
for land training in swimmers.47– 49 However, of the 27 
different isometric and isokinetic shoulder strength mea-
sures investigated in six articles, only three significant 
associations were reported by two articles.20,40 The three 
significant associations were various external:internal ro -
tational isokinetic strength ratios.20,40 In a cross-  sectional 
study, Bak and Magnusson40 found significantly greater 
eccentric external rotation:concentric internal rotation 
in injured swimmers compared to healthy swimmers but 
reported no difference in concentric external:concentric 
internal or eccentric external:eccentric internal rotations. 
Similarly, Drigny et al.20 reported an eccentric external 
rotation:concentric internal rotation strength ratio <0.68 
had a relative risk of 4.5, with eccentric external rota-
tion:eccentric internal rotation strength ratio also demon-
strating predictive ability for shoulder injury risk (<0.66) 
in their prospective study. It should be noted that this 
article found no association between concentric external 
rotation: concentric internal rotation ratio, or eccentric 
internal rotation ratio: concentric external rotation ratio 
and shoulder injury. Further investigation should be di-
rected toward understanding the clinical significance of 
such ratios, especially regarding eccentric shoulder rota-
tor contractions given their absence in swimming. While 
rotational strength imbalances appear to be associated 
with shoulder injury, maximal shoulder strength (relative 
to bodyweight or absolute) does not. However, while cur -
rent evidence is limited given the lack of replication, it is 
plausible that shoulder strength-  endurance may be more 
indicative of injury compared to maximal strength.
The highest rated prospective cohort study included in 
this review investigated the posterior shoulder endurance 
test and its relationship to shoulder pain.21 The test, first Risk factorStudies reporting significant

described in baseball players,50 involves an athlete laying 
prone on a plinth with their test arm hanging vertically 
off the side. The participant then raises their arm to 90° 
horizontal abduction with a dumbbell weighing approxi-
mately 2% of bodyweight, the participant repeats this until 
volitional exhaustion.21,50 This exercise has been shown to 
elicit high levels of activation in trapezius, supraspina-
tus, and infraspinatus.50 In their sample of competitive 
swimmers, Feijen et al.21 found for every one additional 
repetition the swimmer performed, their risk of shoulder 
pain decreased by 5%. Tate et al.11 modified the posterior 
shoulder endurance test and found a significant increase 
toward the end of the season. Unfortunately, this investi-
gation did not statistically analyze the test's relationship 
with shoulder pain. Beach et al.35 further support the as -
sociation of strength-  endurance in abduction and external 
rotation and pain. This cross-  sectional study found mean 
peak torque (after 50 repetitions at 240°/sec) in both ex -
ternal rotation and abduction accounted for 54% and 60% 
of the variation in shoulder pain rating in left and right 
arms, respectively. In addition to abduction and external 
rotation endurance, one case–  control study found mul-
tiple significant findings relating to various measures of 
shoulder and core strength-  endurance.46 While being 
careful not to overstate the clinical relevance of shoulder 
strength-  endurance given its limited evidence, this is per -
haps the modifiable- intrinsic risk factor with the greatest 
supporting evidence. When combined with its capacity to 
be modified with appropriate shoulder injury prevention 
programs, strength-  endurance has potential to be a highly 
clinically relevant measure. Due to the impact of shoul-
der fatigue during swimming, it is possible that increased 
endurance of the posterior rotator cuff can enhance the 
stability of the humeral head in the glenoid. In turn, this 
may help mitigate the shoulders tendency for functional 
impingement, particularly during longer swimming 
sets.51 Future studies should reappraise shoulder strength- 
endurance, particularly the posterior shoulder test, to 
confirm its association with shoulder pain or injury, and 
whether any such association is causal or consequent.
4.2 | Modifiable-  extrinsic risk factors
Despite 81% of Olympic swimming events taking less than 
140 s, training volume is relatively high compared to other 
cyclical sports.52 Barry et al.53 surveyed 31 swim coaches 
and support staff (78% of whom had >10 years experience 
in competitive swimming) and found that 96% moni-
tored training distance and 92% measured session rating 
of perceived exertion (RPE). Of these experts, 38% per-
ceived their training volume monitoring practices to be 
either “very” or “extremely effective” in preventing injury. However, the current evidence does not support these ex-
pert beliefs. This review found moderate evidence against 
the association of training frequency (sessions/week) and 
injury, limited evidence against training time, and con-
flicting evidence supporting an association of training dis-
tance and shoulder injury. No included study investigated 
session RPE.
Although perhaps logical to consider absolute training 
load (i.e., training time and/or distance) as injury risk fac-
tors, only two included articles reported a significant associ-
ation between injury and training time7 or distance.7,24 Mise 
et al.24 found injured swimmers swam significantly further 
than non- injured swimmers when males and females were 
pooled together. However, when separated by sex, there 
was a significant difference in females only. Further, Sein 
et al.7 found all who swam > 20 h/week, or >60 km/week 
exhibited supraspinatus tendinopathy on MRI, and swim-
ming >15 h/week doubled the chance of tendinopathy 
while those swimming > 35 km/week had four times the 
rate of supraspinatus tendinopathy. While these absolute 
training load measures have some individual support as 
shoulder injury risk factors, the overall evidence is not con-
clusive. An earlier systematic review of swimming training 
load and pain, injury, and illness54 also reported no clear 
evidence of association between training volume and pain 
but did present one article55 that found an association be -
tween retrospectively reported yearly training distance and 
injury. However, this article was excluded from the current 
study as shoulder injury data were not presented separately 
from other injuries. Another study13 did report a significant 
association between weekly training time and pain but was 
also excluded from the current study due to unacceptable 
method quality (see online supplementary material S3).
A possible reason why no clear association is seen be -
tween training load and injury is that these absolute mea-
sures fail to account for the rate of load application. For 
example, this monitoring fails to differentiate between 
swimming 1 km in 50 m maximal efforts, versus 1 km in 
recovery. An example of a swimmer's relative training load 
is in their acute:chronic workload ratio. In fact, this ratio 
was monitored by 31% of coaches in Barry et al.53 sample 
of expert practitioners. In swimming, acute:chronic work -
load ratio has been investigated by one research team who 
found every 1- unit increase in this ratio lead to a shoulder 
injury odds ratio of 4.3.21 However, the use of this metric 
has been scrutinized for its inaccuracies and statistical ar -
tifacts and cannot currently be recommended for use in 
reducing injury risk.56 With the advent of water- proof iner -
tial measurement unit's, more specific shoulder measures 
may become available to monitor including number and 
velocity of shoulder revolutions, potentially increasing the 
validity of relative training loads. Such research is currently 
being conducted in water polo,57 and should be repeated

in swimming populations. Future studies should also con-
sider monitoring internal load including RPE, sleep, and 
psychological inventories as suggested by Soligard et al.58
Further to training load, the swimmer's competitive 
level had moderate evidence supporting its association 
with shoulder injury. Two cross-  sectional and one cohort 
study have analyzed competitive level, and all found a sig -
nificant association.7,21,38 However, the direction of this 
association is not clear. Sein et al.7 found that swimmers 
who competed at a higher level had greater rates of su-
praspinatus tendinopathy. Feijen et al.21 found regional 
swimmers had a lower injury risk than club swimmers, 
but no significant differences were present for national 
versus club, or international versus club swimmers. 
Matsuura et al.38 found that elite swimmers who made the 
Japanese Olympic team had less injury prevalence than 
the elite swimmers who did not qualify for the Olympics. 
Matsuura et al.'s study is likely confounded as injured 
swimmers would likely be underperforming, therefore 
negatively impacting team selection. While there is mod-
erate evidence suggesting different competitive levels have 
different injury rates, the relationship between these is not 
clear and is potentially an artifact of different training vol-
umes or intensities, both in and out of the water.
4.3 | Non- modifiable risk factors
There was moderate evidence against an association be-
tween height, sex, and age with shoulder pain. While there 
was only limited evidence supporting shoulder injury his-
tory and future injury, articles reporting an association 
exhibited dramatic effect sizes.14,22,33 A history of shoul-
der injury increased risk of future injury, by 4.7,33 7,22 and 
4.1 times.14 Further, Walker et al.14 showed those with a 
shoulder injury history were 11.3 times more likely to sus-
tain a future shoulder injury lasting >2 weeks. These large 
effects highlight the need for primary injury prevention 
in adolescent swimmers. However, this may be somewhat 
inflated due to articles potentially failing to differentiate 
between an index injury, exacerbation, reinjury, and new 
injury. These terms have previously been defined in a con-
sensus statement on methodologies for injury surveillance 
in aquatic sports.59 All future research should consider 
adopting these terms to not only avoid the inflation of in-
jury history as a risk factor, but also to improve inter- study 
consistency allowing for future metanalyses.
4.4 | Other/secondary risk factors
Injured swimmers appear to exhibit different muscle activ-
ity profiles when performing functional upper extremity tasks,41,43 and scapula elevation.45 This has led to thus far 
unsupported speculation as being a possible causal mech-
anism for injury recurrence and suggestions that motor 
control exercises be used in injury rehabilitation.41,43,45 
Similarly, it has been suggested that swimmers report-
ing lower pain- pressure thresholds42 and fatigue- related 
changes in scapula orientation44 are at higher risk of in-
jury. However, caution is recommended when concluding 
these are shoulder pain or injury risk factors. These arti-
cles tested swimmers with and without shoulder pain in a 
single session potentially experiencing some pain inhibi-
tion requiring compensatory increases in activity of other 
muscles. Due to the study designs, it is not possible to 
conclude whether these other/secondary risk factors were 
present prior to the shoulder pain or occurred with the 
presence of pain. This is particularly relevant for Hidalgo- 
Lozano et al.41 who claim the presence of trigger points 
leads to the development of shoulder pain based on the 
finding that swimmers with painful shoulders presented 
with active muscle trigger points.
4.5 | Findings from prior reviews
The current study expands upon a 2015 systematic review 
by Hill et al.16 who reported joint instability, internal and 
external rotation ROM, pain history, and the swimmer's 
competitive level as the shoulder injury risk factors with 
the highest level of confidence. Our updated evaluation 
incorporating recent research, challenges the perceived 
association between rotational ROM and shoulder injury, 
and downgrades joint laxity to a conflicting evidence. 
Nevertheless, the updated evidence continues to support 
the swimmer's competitive level (moderate evidence) and 
pain history (limited evidence) as variables associated 
with shoulder injury.
Hill's review also reported several variables associated 
with shoulder injury but supported with low confidence, 
the majority of these now contravened by the most recent 
evidence, including rotational strength, sex, and breath-
ing side. In fact, training volume is the only variable that 
is still supported by the current evidence. In addition, 
years of swimming experience and use of hand paddles 
currently displaying conflicting evidence, adding a layer 
of complexity to their roles as potential contributors to 
shoulder injury.
4.6 | Limitations and recommendations
Before swimming practitioners apply any of the current 
review's findings, it is important to highlight that it is not 
known whether the presented risk factors are causal or 
 16000838, 2023, 12, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/sms.14454, Wiley Online Library on [12/08/2024].

McKENZIE et al.
noncausal. This review synthesizes known associations 
between various measures and shoulder pain and injury, 
some of these measures may occur concurrently with pain 
or injury without being an underlying cause. Currently, it 
is not known if altering any risk factor will decrease injury 
incidence. Preliminary evidence suggests exercise- based 
programs in swimmers could reduce shoulder injury inci-
dence.48,51,60,61 Nevertheless, before meaningful conclusions 
can be drawn, subsequent investigations should include the 
following methodological improvements, larger samples, 
refined pain definitions, and longer monitoring periods. For 
swimming practitioners looking to use the presented evi-
dence for their athlete monitoring or injury prevention pro-
grams, we highlight the following areas for consideration:
 (i) A swimmer's ROM is not likely a predictor of injury. 
Monitoring changes throughout a season/career may 
produce meaningful outcomes; however, it is not 
clear if “improving” ROM is beneficial.
 (ii) Maximal shoulder strength is likely not associated 
with shoulder injury. While studies have associated 
various shoulder rotation strength ratios with pain, 
due to the lack of maximal eccentric contraction 
during swimming, we do not believe these ratio's to 
be practically relevant injury risk factors. Improving 
shoulder strength-  endurance may be of more benefit.
 (iii) Monitoring absolute training load as a means of 
shoulder injury risk is not supported by the litera-
ture. Relative training loads and new technologies 
may be worth consideration.
 (iv) Clinicians and coaches should be aware that previ-
ously injured swimmers are at high risk of re- injury. 
Greater care and monitoring for swimmers with 
shoulder injury history is needed during their reha-
bilitation and return- to- swim programming. Efforts 
in primary injury prevention may be exponentially 
beneficial.
To improve on the current research, there is a need for 
highly controlled prospective studies in competitive swim-
mers. Risk factors presented in this review should be reap -
praised using the same methods in different populations 
to validate the measure and cutoff scores.62 We suggest the 
need for risk factor reappraisal is greater than the need 
for additional exploratory investigations given the current 
body of knowledge. Excluding training load monitoring, 
potential risk factors are typically monitored at a single 
time point while the associated injury may occur several 
months later. Future prospective studies should moni-
tor modifiable- intrinsic risk factors at regular intervals 
throughout the collection period (e.g., every 1– 3 months), 
reflecting their modifiable nature. Tate et al.11 have shown 
many shoulder metrics change throughout the season, including posterior shoulder endurance, horizontal ad-
duction ROM, and internal and external ROM, highlight -
ing the need to regularly monitor. However, this article 
failed to statistically associate these variables with pain. 
As more prospective studies are conducted, it is critical for 
subsequent systematic reviews to consider their approach. 
These reviews should exclusively include only prospec-
tive designs or weight these studies greater than cross- 
sectional studies due to their inherently greater quality. 
Future research should adopt the injury definitions de -
fined by Mountjoy et al.59, this is particularly relevant to 
the definitions of pain and injury, index injury, exacerba-
tion, reinjury, and new injury. Adopting these definitions 
will allow future reviews to pool data between studies 
improving inferences that can be drawn. New technolo -
gies, such as inertial measurement units, should be inves -
tigated particularly as they relate to relative training loads. 
Finally, internal training loads such as RPE, sleep quality, 
and other psychological metrics should be investigated for 
their possible role in performance and injury.
5 | PERSPECTIVES TO SPORTS 
MEDICINE
A thorough understanding of shoulder injury risk factors 
is critical for the development of athlete screening and 
injury prevention protocols in competitive swimmers. As 
evidenced in this review, there is contention regarding 
risk factors, with many researchers exploring new poten-
tial risk factors as opposed to confirming existing risk fac-
tors in new populations. While it is not known whether 
the identified risk factors in this review are causal or non-
causal, clinicians may use these risk factors to develop 
screening protocols and injury prevention programs in 
their athletes.
