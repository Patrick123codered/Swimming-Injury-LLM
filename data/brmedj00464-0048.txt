Thepsychosomatic findings inCrohn's

Immunisation andbraindamage
SIR,-In viewofthestatement ofDrG
Schoenewald (30April,p1159)that"wehave
nolarge-scale experience witheitherpertussis
onlyorwithdiphtheria-tetanus onlyvaccina-
tions"sofarasvaccinal braindamage is
concerned Ishouldliketorecallourdatafrom
Hamburg fortheperiod 1961-70. Among
146480children immunised withdiphtheria
andtetanustoxoids wefoundonlytwocasesof
convulsions (1per73445vaccinees), while
among 41250children vaccinated with
diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus vaccinetherewere
19casesoffits(1per2200vaccinees).' The
difference inthefrequency ofconvulsions after
thetwotypesofimmunisation isstatistically
significant (y2test:P<0001).Thereisno
doubtthatfiguresforpermanent damage due
topertussis immunisation varyfromcountry
tocountry: Hansen foundonesuchevent
among25000vaccinees inDusseldorf2 andwe
ourselves oneamong20600vaccinees.'
Itiswellknownthatneuralcomplications
following tetanus toxoidadministration are
extremely rare,andinareviewoftheliterature,
including ourowncases,wecollected onlya
fewcasesofneuralcomplications following
diphtheria toxoidimmunisation.

Hormonal pregnancy testsand

SIR,-I havereadwithinterest DrDT
Janerich's article(23April,p1058)confirming
theteratological effectofhormonal pregnancy
testsandotherexogenous sexhormone
preparations inrelation tocongenital heart
diseases.
Thediscovery oftheteratological effectof
hormonal pregnancy testsemerged frommy
studiesintocentralnervous systemmalforma-
tionsin1967.'Inthisandinfurther publica-
tionsonthistopic2 5theteratogenic potential
ofhormonal pregnancy testshasalwaysbeenreferred to"congenital malformations," with-
outspecifying thetypebutmentioning thatthe

mystudythenincluded onlythisparticular
malformation. Theanalogous effectbetween
hormonal pregnancy testsandtheuseof
otherexogenous sexhormone preparations in
earlypregnancy hasbeenemphasised inall
theabovecommunications.
Iampleased thatsubsequent studieshave
confirmed myobservation indifferent typesof

Therefore itwouldbemoreprudent to

Quality control fordrugmonitoring
SIR,-Your leadingarticleonqualitycontrolof
laboratories (7May,p1180)highlighted the
necessity forexternal quality control in
analytical workinpathology laboratories and
mentioned thenational schemes forclinical
chemistry, haematology, andmicrobiology.
Thelackofschemes forhistopathology and
immunology waspointed out,butnomention
wasmadeofananalytical fieldwhichis
becoming increasingly important-namely,
thatofdrugmonitoring. There isnow
increasing evidence thatthemeasurement of
serumlevelsisinvaluable intherational useof
various drugs,including theantiepileptic
drugs,lithium, digoxin, antidysrhythmics,
theophylline, antibiotics, andtricyclic anti-
depressants. Manyclinical chemistry and
clinicalpharmacology departments nowoffera
service formeasuring thesecompounds,
particularly thefirstthree.
Ingeneral, thecurrenttechniques usedfor
measuring druglevelsarelessreliable than
thoseusedinclinicalchemistry, andthereisthe
addedproblem ofinterference fromother
drugsormetabolites. Furthermore, thereisno
"normal range"ofserumlevelstoalertthe
analyst toanerroneous resultbecause levels
fromzerototoxicmaybeencountered in
patients forwhomstandard dosesofdrugs
areprescribed. Asaresultthereliability of
druganalyses ispoor,ashasbeenclearly
shownforantiepileptic drugs.'External quality
control istherefore essential iftheclinician is
nottobemisledbyinaccurate results.
In1972Istarted theStBartholomew'sHospital quality control scheme foranti-
epileptic drugs,andthishasgradually ex-
panded toinclude 162laboratories intheUK,
mostWestern European countries, andseveral
countries outside Europe. Although itsofar
lacksthesupport oftheDepartment ofHealth
andSocialSecurity, negotiations arepro-
ceeding withtheBureau deR6ference,
Commission desCommunautes Europeennes,
todevelop primary reference standards which
canbeadopted inanalytical work.Atarecent
meeting attheUniversity ofSurrey150ofthe
participants cametogether todiscusswaysin
whichthescheme couldbeimproved, and
valuable guidance wasgivenbyProfessor TP
Whitehead, whowasresponsible forinitiating
theBirmingham schemeforclinicalchemistry.
InNorth America asimilar scheme for
antiepileptic drugshasbeensetupbyDr
Charles Pippenger atColumbia University,
NewYork.
Inthefutureitisintended toexpand the
StBartholomew's Hospital scheme toinclude
otherdrugswhich arebeingincreasingly
measured. Anyone interested intakingpartin
thescheme isinvited tocontact theunder-

Lithium asadrugofabuse
SIR,-As apsychiatrist practising invarious
areasandsubspecialties withinpsychiatry over
thepastfewyearsithasbeenbrought tomy
attention bymypatients thatthespectrum of
drugsinvolved in"drugabuse," particularly
byadolescents andyoungadults,hasextended

wouldgenerally notconsider tobeofmuch

increasing abuseofbenzhexol (which, Iam
giventounderstand, whentakeninfairly
largeamounts provides ashort-lived experience
ofeuphoria) whileinaddition tothewell-
known abuseofsedatives andhypnotics,
particularly methaqualone/diphenhydramine
(Mandrax) andbarbiturates, abuseofchlorpro-
mazine, thioridazine, andsimilardrugsisnot
atalluncommon.
Ofmoreserious import, however, isthe
fairlyrecent(overthepasttwoyearsorso)
abuseoflithium preparations, bothasthe
normallithiumcarbonate tabletandalsoasthe
slow-release preparations. Ihavenotyetbeen
abletoestablish whythesedrugsarebeing
used-indeed abused-by poly-drug abusers.
However, inviewofthefactthatlithium
preparations areindeedbeingabusedinthis
wayitiswellworthalerting casualty officers
andtheliketotheveryseriousconsequences
oftheingestion oflargeamounts oflithium
inanyformwhatsoever andreminding all
doctors thatinacaseoflithium intoxication a
