An u pdated review of the epidemiology of swimming injuries  
  
O
bjective: To carry out a systematic review to update the scientific evidence on the incidence and 
prevalence of injuries in the swimming discipline, as well as the location, type and mechanism of the 
injuries, and to assess whether studies are meeting methodological recommendations for data collection and injury surveillance. Literature Survey : The databases of Pubmed and Sportdiscus were used to search for studies that 
describe the epidemiology of injuries in adult swimmers between 2010 to March 2020. Method ology: Of the 864 articles identified, 1 4 studies were finally included in this  review. The 
methodological quality of  the studies was analysed with the Strobe scale and PRISMA guidelines 
were followed.  
Synthesis : The results showed a high prevalence of shoulder, knee and lower back injuries among 
swimmers due to overuse. These injuries were mainly short -term tendon- muscles, there were reported 
data differences between genders.  
Conclusions: Despite the publication of an injury surveillance single and multi- sport events 
document and a consensus on data collection and injury surveillance in swimming, there are huge 
methodological limitations that do not allow firm conclusions. As such, m ore epidemiological studies 
following guidelines for data collection and injury surveillance are needed to establish differences by 
gender, age group, and swimming stroke. Keywords: swimming, risk factors,  prevention, shoulder, tendinopathy.

Epidemiology of swimming injuries  
An updated review of the epidemiology of swimming injuries  
 
 Swimming has become one of the most practi sed and popular sports worldwide1,2 thanks to its 
peculiarity  of being  in an aquatic environment3, and the multitude of benefits that it brings to  the 
health2,4,5. Likewise, swimming is available to everyone regardless of age and sex, since the water 
hardly generates an impact on the bones and joints2. Nevertheless , its cyclical nature, combined with 
large training loads, high technical requirements and demands on strength to overcome an external 
load, mainly in the upper limb6,7, might lead to  joint and muscular overloads, increasing the risk of 
injury8-10. For example, an elite swimmer can swim an average of 6 -10 km per day , 5 to 7 days a 
week, and often twice a day. This equates approximately 60 to 80 km and 30,000 strokes per week11,12. 
In particular , two reviews have described that the most common injuries in swimming occur m ainly 
due to overuse in the knee, the lumbar/hip area, and especially in the shoulder of the swimmer8,10. 
Regarding the type of injury, it seems that the most predominant injuries are  musculoskeletal and 
ligamentous8,10. 
There is no consensus on reporting injury rates, however, which does not allow us to compare 
the risk of injury in swimmers across studies. Injuries have a negative impact on the swimmer , 
evoking a high number of absences in training and/or competition13-15, leading  to chronic pain or even 
end up in a surgery16,17 which can turn into a disability or withdrawal from the sport15,18,19. 
Furthermore, the pain may persist for years after withdrawal19, and as a consequence, this is 
associated with a great social and economic cost for the athlete.  
Notwithstanding , research on the prevalence of swimming injuries is precarious from a  
methodological level8. Swimming science  does  not allow the establish ment of  valid and reliable 
conclusions to develop effective program mes aimed at reducing the incidence and severity  of injuries

in this sport8, as is the case in other sports , where injury registration guidelines have been already  
established20-23.  
 
 Th
e swimming literature has mainly focused on shoulder injuries, largely avoiding other less 
prevalent injuries that may be just as relevant.  Likewise, most of the identified studies were 
descriptive or retrospective with low samples and using a questionnaires format8. For this reason, in 
2016, the International Swimming Federation (FINA) publishe d a consensus statement on the 
methodology of injury and illness surveillance in aquatic sports24. This document not only discuss es 
medical care guideline s for swimmers at the elite level , but it also examines a wide array of different 
competition s and age levels24. As such, the aim  of the document is to improve the quality of the data 
collected and the development of effective and individualised preventive measures.  On the other 
hand, a previous document (2008)  has been shown to be reliable  in the injury surveillance for single -
sport and multi -sport events, thus, its use allow s comparison of the results between swimming 
studies25.  
Since the last reviews, there are several  epidemiological studies that have been published in 
swimming in clubs14,15,26-28 as well as  in international championships13,29 ,30,3 1 that could improve the 
quality of the existing information8,10. Therefore, it is important to check if the injury surveillance for 
single and multi- sport events  and swimming guidelines established for the data collection have been 
followed24,25  in order to respond to the suggestions established by Gaunt and Maffuli8. Doing so will 
allow rigorous compliance with the first step of the guidelines to develop effective prevention 
program mes for swimmers32. Therefore, the objective s of this study were to carry out a systematic 
review to update the scientific evidence on the incidence and prevalence of injuries in the swimming discipline, as well as the location, type and mechanism of the injuries ; and to assess whether  studies 
are meeting methodologica l recommendations for data collection and injury surveillance.

Method  
 
 T
o carry out this study, guidelines for reporting systematic reviews of observational studies in 
epidemiology (PRISMA guidelines) were followed33. PRISMA checklist can be found in Appendix 
1.  
 
  
Search strategy  
Potential studies were identified by combined search processes, clearly planned and ordered. 
First, the following bibliographical databases were consulted: PubMed and Sportdiscus with the 
following search terms included in Boolean search strategies: (swim* [tiab] OR aquatic[ tiab]) AND 
(injury[ tiab] OR incidence [tiab] OR prevalence[ tiab] OR epidemiology [tiab]) or in Spanish 
(natación [tiab] OR acuático [tiab]) AND (lesión [tiab] OR incidencia[ tiab] OR prevalencia[ tiab] OR 
epidemiología [tiab]). By using filter criteria of the respective databases, the search was limited to 
publication dates (from 01/01/2010 to 31/03/2020), species (humans), and English and Spanish 
languages. Finally, the reference lists of the studies recovered were hand -searched to identify 
potentially eligible studies not captured by the electronic searches.  
Two reviewers independently (A.T. and H.G -G.): a) screened the title and abstract of each 
reference to locate potentially relevant studies, and once hard  copies of the screened documents were 
obtained; b) reviewed them in detail to identify articles that met the selection criteria. A third external reviewer (A.L -V.) was consulted to resolve discrepancies between reviewers in the studies selection. 
 Study selection

Epidemiology of swimming injuries  
To be included in the systematic review, the studies had to fulfil the following criteria: 1) studies 
m
ust report either injury incidence rate or prevalence in  swimmers ; 2) swimmers had to be adults or 
compete at a high level of swimming ; 3) preventive studies had to provide a control group to be 
included in this review; 4) the study had to be published in a peer -reviewed journal; and 5) it had to 
be written in English or Spanish. Literature reviews, abstracts, editorial commentaries and letters to 
the editors were excluded. Finally, some authors were contacted to provide missing data. Moreover, incomplete data, or data from an already included study, were excluded. 
 
 W
ith the aim of guaranteeing the maximum possible objectivity, a codebook was produced that 
specified the standards followed in coding each of the studies characteristics. The moderator variables 
of the eligible studies were coded and grouped into three categories: 1) general study descriptors (e.g ., 
authors, country of the sample, year of publication, and study design); 2) description of the study population (e.g ., sample size, age, sex, stroke type and level of the swimmers); and 3) main 
epidemiologic findings (e.g ., injury and exposure data, distribution of injuries by ana tomic location, 
type of injury, injury severity and mechanism of the injuries). The datasets used and/or analysed during the current study are available from the corresponding author upon request.  
 
Quality assessment  
Two reviewers independently assessed th e reporting quality of included studies using an 
adapted version of the “Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology” 
(STROBE) statement
34. All included studies were rated on 11 specific criteria which were derived 
from items 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 14 and 15 of the original checklist. The STROBE scale was considered 
as a suitable starting point for assessing the quality of observational studies34. This 11- item checklist 
provides guidance on the reporting of observational studies in order to facilitate critical appraisal and

interpretation of results. The observational studies were considered as having a low risk of bias if 
t
hey were determined as hi gh quality (score of ≥7/11) or a high risk of bias if they were low quality 
(≤6/11)34.  
 
 I
n order to assess the inter -coder reliability of the coding process, two researchers coded all 
studies randomly (including methodological quality assessment). For the quantitative moderator variables , intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) were calculated, while for the qualitative 
moderator variables , Cohen’s kappa coefficients were applied. On average, the ICC was 0.87 (range: 
0.77 – 1.0) and the kappa coefficient was 0.92 (range: 0.83 - 1.0), which can be considered highly 
satisfactory
35. The inconsistencies between the two coders were resolved by consensus, and when 
these were due to ambiguity in the coding book, this was corrected. As previously mentioned, any disagreement was resolved by mutual consent in consultation with a third reviewer.  
   Results  
After the search process , 805 were deleted due to duplication or not meeting inclusion criteria 
based on review of the title and abstract. The remaining 59 articles were selected for their complete review. Finally, 45 articles were excluded due to not meeting some of the established inclusion criteria and thus 14 articles were included in the present review
13-15,26-31, 36-40. The article selection process 
can be found in Figure 1.

Descriptive characteristics of the studies  
 
 T
he main characteristics of each of the integrated studies are presented in Table 1. The studies 
selected were carried out between 2010 and 2019. Three studies were carried out in the United States 
of America (USA), two in Japan, one in Brazil, one in Finland, one in Denmark, four in World 
Championships and two in Olympic Games. The total sample size was larger than 6.000 swimmers. 
Thirteen out of f ourteen  included both male and females, and only one study included only female 
swimmers39. 
Twelve articles provided information about the location of injuries and eight articles about the 
type of injuries. One article  studied only the prevalence of spine/low back injuries38. 
 
***Please insert Table 1 near here*** 
 
Quality of the selected studies  With regards to the reporting quality of the studies, the mean score obtained with the STROBE 
quality scale was 7 (minimum: 5, maximum: 9) , showing high quality, low bias  in most of the studies 
included in the review. All studies reported participation locations, and most of the relevant dates about recruitment, follow -up and data collection. However, very few of the  studies included data 
about methods of follow -up, verified injuries by a medical professional and indicated the number of 
participants with missing data. The detailed data are presented in Table 2.  
Furthermore, it is quite relevant to show that five papers provided retrospective data. It has been 
assumed than retrospective studies have more bias since the study operations, data collected, data entry, and data quality assurance, were not planned ahead of time, thus some data could be lost

njury incidence 
Only six studies15,27-30,40 included incidence values  in their research . Nevertheless, al most all 
the studies presented a different value. Chase et al.27 revealed that university swimmers suffer  3.04 
injuries/1000hours of exposure or 5.55 injuries per  1000 athlete exposure (AE),  with the incidence 
greater in females t han males  (3.32 injuries/1000 hours of exposure or 6.06 injuries 1000 AE vs 2.74 
injuries/1000 hours of exposure or 4.97 injuries 1000 AE, respectively). On the other hand, 
Ristololainen et al.15 found lower values of incidence than Chase et al.27 in elite swimmers with  2.6 
injuries/1000 hours of exposure. In the same line, Kerr et al.28 also showed a  lower  incidence in 
university swimmers , both females (1.48 injuries/1000 AE)  and males  (1.63 injuries/1000 AE). 
Finally, Mountjoy et al.30,40 reflected the incidence in World Championships with values of 31.9 
injuries/1000 athletes and 6,1 injuries per  100 registered athletes, respectively , while Dijkstra et al.29, 
in a 25m pool World Championship, revealed much lower incidenc e (3,5 injuries per 100 registered 
athletes) . In the 2009 World Championship30, as in the rest  of the studies , the incidence was higher 
in females  (34.8 injuries per 1000 athletes ) than males  (21.8 injuries per 1000 athletes).  
    
Injury location All studies  reported information about the localisation of injuries , except for Folkvardsen et 
al.
38. Most of the studies pointed out that shoulder or shoul der/clavicle injuries were the most common 
injury location in swimmers, except for two studies14,39. Those studies  showed that the most common

location of injuries was  the lower back follow ed by shoulder injuries, although Nagano et al.39 only 
included overuse injuries. In this sense, all studies included back/lower  - back/upper - back/trunk 
(different methodological classifications) as one of the most frequent injur ies in swimmers. On the 
other hand, most of the studies in World Championships29,30,40 and Olympic Games31, revealed that 
wrist/hand injuries were very common in these competitions. Regarding lower extremities, knee and 
ankle are the regions more affected by the injuries in swimmers. M ore detailed information can be 
found in Table 3.  
 
 ***P

Comparing gender -location injuries, only four studies established a difference between male 
and female swimmers26,27,28,36. Shoulder injuries were the most common  in both male and female in 
all studies. Spine/trunk/ back was the second most usual injury in one study , both male and female28, 
and in the male sample  of Chase et al.27. In the female sample of Chase et al.27, ankle and knee injuries 
were more frequent than back injuries. Otherwise, De Almeida et al.36 found that the knee was the 
second region most affected by injuries in both male and female, follow ed by lower back and 
ankle/foot, respectively.  
Finally, one  study38 further classified reported lower -back injuries in elite swimmers  by spinal 
level , and the L5-S1 region was the most affected ( more than 30%  of injuries ), followed by L4- L5 
(25.3%), L1- L2 (19.8%) and L2 -L3/L3 -L4 (15.4% each one).  
 Injury type Seven studies analysed the type of injuries suffer ed by swimmers
27,28,30,31,36,37,40. Strain/-
tendinopathy injuries seem to be the most usual injuries in swimmers . However, this statement should 
be analysed with caution due to the different classifications used in each study. Moreover, c ontusions

also showed a higher prevalence (6% -17.4% ) in all studies included. For instance, Chase et al.27 and 
Kerr et al .28 found that strain and tendonitis were the most usual type of injury in university swimmers 
followed by sprain. Concerning International Championships, Mountjoy et al.30 combined strain and 
sprain injuries as the most common type of injury (33%), thus, it cannot be compared to other studies 
in the same way. Engebretsen et al.37, showed that more than 20% were strain injuries followed by 
sprain (16%) and tendinosis (12%), similar to Mountjoy et a l.40 which registered 18.5% of tendinosis, 
followed by sprain (12.3%) and strain (6.2%). Contrary to these findings, Soligard et al.31, in the 2016 
Olympic games, showed sprain/ligament ruptures were more frequent (26.1%) than 
tendinosis/tendinopathy (17.4%).  
 
 F
inally, Folkvardsen et al.38 provided information about the type of lower back injuries. Disc 
degeneration (52.7%) was the mos t common type of spine injury, followed by bulges (26.4%) and 
herniations (20.9%) in elite swimmers.  
 Mechanism of injuries Five studies showed that overuse injuries occurred more  frequently than contact/traumatic 
injuries
15,27,28,29,31, while one study found a higher prevalence of traumatic injuries37. However, 
traumatic injuries were more common than overuse injuries in male samples  of two studies27,28. 
Regarding gender differences, overuse injuries where more frequent in female in two studies27,28. 
 Severity of injuries  
Only one study
 included any severity classification , measured by duration of time needed for 
recovery,  in their studies. In the Ristolainen et al.15 study, m inor injuries (> 1 week) were the most 
common injuries (63.5%) , in both male and female . Besides, m ajor injuries (> 3 weeks) showed  a

njuries by stroke type  
One study provided information  about injuries by stroke type29. Both males and females  
suffered more injuries (>45%) when the four swimming strokes (butterfly, backstroke, breaststroke, and freestyle) where combined in a sequential order (individual medley) during training and/or race. The second stroke with more injuries in male s was the butterfly, followed by freestyle, backstroke 
and breaststroke. In females, backstroke had a higher prevalence than males, followed by butterfly and breaststroke with the same prevalence as  males, and freestyle with lower prevalence than males.  
 
Discussion  
The main finding of this review is that , to date , the methodological recommendations for data 
collection and injury surveillance in swimming are not being followed
24,25. Only 6 studies included 
these methodologies in their research13,14,29,30,31,40. As a whole, several definitions of injury or pain, 
and different classifications of location, type, mechanism and severity of injuries are used, as well as 
the incidence values provided (1000 hours exposure/100 athlete exposure, 10.000 athlete exposure, 
injuries per athlete, competition starts , etc). As a consequence, this lack of guidelines in methodology 
hinder ed ways to compare all those results to establish preventive measures depending on category, 
age, gender, swimming stroke and/or level, that might allow reducing the number and severity of the 
most prevalent injuries in swimming.

Epidemiology of swimming injuries  
Secondly, shoulder, back and knee injuries are the main locations of  i njuries. Regarding the 
type of injury, it seems that overuse muscle/tendon injuries (cramps/strains/tendinopathies) are the 
most common . 
 
  I
njury incidence  
The incidence of injuries (2.6- 3.0 injuries per 1000 hours of exposure / 1.5- 5.5 injuries per -
1000 AE / 3.2- 6.1 per -100 registered athletes) shows that swimming is a sport with a relatively low 
risk of injury compared to other sports with great involvement of the upper body31,37. This is mainly 
due to the characteristics of the environment in which the sport takes place, without impacts, without interference with other rivals or teammates and without any implement, which greatly reduces the probability of injury
42,43. 
The incidence of injuries seems to be higher in competitions than in training, although the 
prevalence is much higher in training. However, the pressure to which athletes are exposed during the competition
44, the intensity and the overload of events in the competition13,30,31,37, 40, and the 
limited recovery time between t he events greatly increase the risk of injury43. 
A high  percentage of the studies included in this review indicate a higher incidence of injuries 
in women swimmers than in men. This may be due to anatomical, biomechanical, physiological and psychological differences compared to men
45-48. For instance, the shorter length of arms and legs in 
women makes it necessary to perform a greater number of strokes at the same distance, thus 
generating greater stress on the joints47. Likewise, lower levels of strength in women49, as well as the 
energetic differences observed in competition between genders45,47, could generate greater fatigue in 
women and with it, an increased risk of injury. However, the scarcity of studies that analy se the 
influence of different risk factors by gender make it difficult to draw firmer conclusions. Hence, the

importance of carrying out specific studies in order to establish preventive program mes  aimed at 
women and men individually. 
 
  
I
njury location 
Regarding injury location, and in line with previous  reviews3,8,9, the shoulder is the body region 
most affected by injuries, assuming between 16 and 76% of all injuries . The main risk factor for 
shoulder injuries is the repetitive cyclical movement of the glenohumeral joint, with a positive correlation with training time and distance
12. Likewise, these repetitive and continuous movements 
generate great fatigue3 and friction between the different structures of the joint that leads to 
inflammation and pain50. As such, the fatigue caused in the agonist musculature may cause a 
biomechanical alteration in the movement of the shoulder that can trigger an injury3,12. It is also worth 
noting the previous clinical history of pain, a limitation of motion  range , excessive shoulder laxity 
and/or unilateral/bilate ral dominance as determinants of the injury8,10,12,51-53. 
Shoulder prevalence varies slightly according to gender (men: 23.8-50.6% and women: 33.3% 
-41.3%), being slightly higher in men in most of the studies27,29,36. Although women have a lower 
average height and a shorter stroke45, it is likely  that greater muscle development in men and altered 
biomechanics in  women45,54 increase the risk of shoulder injury in men. 
As for knee injuries, the second most injured body region (3.1- 17.7%), are mainly caused by 
overuse8. Likewise, it should be noted that breaststroke swimmers have a greater number of knee 
injuries compared to other strokes55 and up to 75% of breaststrokers report medial knee pain 
throughout their career56. The repetition of certain technical gestures such as the breaststroke kick55,57, 
the frequency and technical intensity of the kick55, a different propulsive pattern58, decompensation 
of the kick angle, a mechanical imbalance of the joint55,59, or the degree of flexion during pushing

from the  w all60, would affect the movement pattern of the knee and increase the risk of injury and 
pain. Likewise, it has been proven that an increased Q angle is related to knee pain57. Hence, the 
importance of teaching the technical performance of the kick and k nowing how to detect possible 
propulsive irregularities at the biomechanical level in swimmers.  
 
 R
egarding gender differences, there is no clear trend in this review. Although the literature does 
not clarify the main risk factors by gender, it could be spec ulated that the differences in the Q angle57, 
as well as the greater propulsive force generated during the kick or the push on the wall after “flip 
turns”61, could increase the risk of injury in men .  
Moreover, the lower back is consolidated as a region with a high risk of swimming injury3,8,10, 
showing a higher prevalence in the butterfly stroke (33-50 % of lower back injuries)62. All 
competitive swimming strokes require that the lumbar spine should be maintained in hyperextension to achieve a streamlined body position while performing trunk rotations, which can generate an excessive load on the lumbar area
3,63. This pain is directly related to the intensity, duration and 
distance of the training, the technique of the undulating strokes and the use of auxiliary material64, 
the position of the cervical region65 and the head during breathing66, along with the “flip turns” typical 
of changes in direction3. In line with previous studies67,68, lower vertebral discs (L4 -L5-S1) were 
more affected by swimming. The fact that lower vertebral discs are the most load -bearing structures 
and that they are the axis of rotation during swimming could explain this high incidence compared to other vertebral areas. Consequently, teaching, correcting an d maintaining good swimming technique, 
as well as strengthening the lumbopelvic complex area 4, could help reduce the risk of injury and 
pain to the lumbar area in swimmers
69,70. 
Unlike shoulder and knee injuries, it seems clear that injuries to the lower back are more 
prevalent in men. A greater hydrostatic lift and a smaller sinking force in women, which would reduce

hyperextension of the lumbar area71,72, the higher percentage of fat and lower relative body weigh t in 
the trunk72, as well as its greater resistance in the trunk extensors73 that would help reduce water 
resistance72 reduces the risk of a lower back injury in women. 
 
 I
njury type  
The most prevalent type of injury in swimmers, strain/tendinopathy, is closely associated with 
the location and mechanism of the previously mentioned injuries, since they appear mainly due to 
repetitive movements in joint areas such as shoulder, knee, intervertebral and hip3,8,10. Although there 
are methodological limitations, no groupings can be established by specific injuries, previous studies 
reveal the main strain/tendinopathy injuries in swimming. For instance, the cyclical movement of the stroke generates some deterioration on the shoulder tha t could destabilise the phase of the arm and 
hand, leading to impingement of the supraspinatus and the long head of the biceps
10,12. Likewise, 
subacromial or intra -articular shock generated  at the end of the aerial recovery phase of the stroke 74 
and during the underwater phase75 is also common . 
On the other hand, the repetitive movement of the kick, especially in the breaststroke, causes 
great strain on the ligaments and tendons of the knee joint3,55. Furthermore, it was pointed out in a 
previous review that a large number of knee pathologies are associated with strain/sprain injuries , 
such as : medial collateral ligament sprain, patellofemoral pain syndrome, patellar tendinopathy 
and/or adductor longus /brevis muscle strains3. All of those previously mentioned pathologies are a 
result of knee valgus during the breaststroke kick58-61, the low angles of hip abduction in the kick58 
and/or repetitive quadriceps contractions associated with flutter and dolphin kicks, and from patellofemoral joint contact pressure during the wall push- off and start
60. 
Concerning the lower back area, the literature refers more to subtypes of spinal disorders such

spondylolisthesis, lumbago and/or lumbosciatica10,64,66,67,76. The need to maintain a position as 
aerodynamic as possible through hyperextension, together with the constant rotation of the trunk, 
generates a great overload in the lower back area that could lead to different tendon, ligament or 
muscle pathologies3,10,66. This position degenerates in pathologies of the intervertebral disc, bulges 
and herniations38,67,68, as well as joint inflammation77. 
 
 S
everity of injuries  
One study included in this review provide d information on the severity of injuries, which shows 
that injuries are predominantly short -term (< 7 days). The fact that a large percentage of injuries are 
due to overuse and not trauma24,31,37,40 as reported in previous reviews8,10, could make recovery faster 
because these injuries would require  only rest in some cases. Injuries such as fractures , ruptures or 
muscle tears , which require long recovery periods, are rare in swimming, so most of the swimming 
injuries allow  to return to practice in short periods of time30,31,37,40. 
Injuries by stroke type  
Unfortunately, only one study in this review reported swim -stroke injuries29. Medley swimmers 
had a much higher prevalence of injuries in both genders, so the combination of several strokes that 
imply different swimming techniques could increase the risk of injury due to abrupt biomechanical changes, together with the co mbination of the risk factors of each stroke
3,42. 
With regards to individual stroke type, butterfly and specially  backstroke were those that had a 
higher prevalence of injuries . This fact may be caused because these strokes , especially butterfly, 
require spinal hyperextension positions and hyperextension plus abduction arm movements10,25,78. If 
we combine these risk factors with limited ranges of motion in some swimmers, we have a combination of potentially risky actions
79,80.  
Limitations

Epidemiology of swimming injuries  
The main limitation of this review is that the  di fferent methodologies used in injury 
definitions, data collection and injury surveillance did not allow a direct comparison between the 
studies . Likewise, few studies provide d relevant information regarding severity, swimming stroke , 
mechanism of injury an d/or age group. It may  decreas e validity and reliability when it comes to 
carrying out effective and individualised preventive program mes. Finally, it is important to highligh t 
that studies comparing and explaining the different risk  patterns by gender are minimal , when there 
is evidence of the anatomical, biomechanical and physiological gender differences45-48.  
 
 C
onclusions 
 The latest epidemiological studies in swimming show a high prevalence of short -term 
muscle /tendon injuries to the shoulder, knee and lower back in adult swimmers . The aforementioned 
studies provided insufficient information regarding the injury pattern due to methodological 
limitations.  Future studies should follow the guideline recommendations in data collection and injury 
surveillance in swimming.  
This review identifies current limitations in understanding of injury type and risk factors. We 
recommend future epidemiological studies follow the methodological recommendations established 
in recent years. Criteria should include the anatomical location, type (acute, overuse, or traumatic), and severity of injuries. Details on population studied should include gender, level, age group, and primary swimming stroke. These common data reporting practices would allow for developing injury specific preventive programs in the predominant stroke of each swimmer and may reduce risk of the most prevalent injuries.
