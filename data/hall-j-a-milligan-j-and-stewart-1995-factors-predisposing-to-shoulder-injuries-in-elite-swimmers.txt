INTRODUCTION
Swimming is a popular recreational and competitive sport in 
many countries, including South Africa.
Competitive swimmers in training are likely to swim between
12 000 metres per day (sprinters) to 18 000 -  20 000 metres per day 
(distance swimmers)1^ . As these distances are covered daily for 
ten to eleven months of the year, five to seven days per week, 
swimmers are susceptible to microtraumatic overuse injuries of 
the shoulder*’. Acute, macrotraumatic injuries may also occur.
This review aims to describe normal stroke mechanics, shoul­
der injuries common to swimmers and also to identify risk factors 
predisposing to injuries of the shoulder in the child and adoles­
cent elite swimmer. This becomes particularly important when it 
is realised that elite swimmers begin swimming competitively by 
the age of eight and are thus at risk of injuries to the cartilage of 
epiphyseal plates, joint surfaces and apophysial insertions of 
tendons.
NORMAL ARM ACTION
TABLE I: NORMAL ARM ACTION
SA Jo u rn a l P hysiotherapy, V ol 51 N o  4and butterfly. Breaststroke is excluded because the greater part of 
the propulsion is derived from the leg action5.
"Dropping" the elbows causes increased external rotation and 
thus impedes propulsion. This is a clear sign of fatigue in a young 
swimmer with untrained adductors and internal rotators, because 
they cannot generate the force required during the recovery 
phase.
14Nuber et al (1986) found that supraspinatus, infraspinatus, 
middle deltoid and serratus anterior were predominantly recov­
ery phase muscles, being active throughout the phase. Serratus 
Anterior demonstrated a peak activity which occurred at hand 
entry and early pull- through phase. This highlights the impor­
tance of scapula rotation when the arm is fully abducted. Latis- 
simus Dorsi and the clavicular head of pectoralis major were the 
major pull- through muscles. Latissimus dorsi was most active at 
90 degrees of abduction as the shoulder progressed from external 
rotation to internal rotation. There was a constant low level of 
activity in the Biceps in both phases. The elbow was flexed during 
both recovery and pull- through phases which would initiate 
biceps activity.
COMMON SHOULDER COMPLAINTS IN SWIMMERS  
IMPINGEMENT SYNDROME
Richardson et al (1980) found that the pain was located about
the acromion and always involved the coracoacromial arch in 
17some way . The coracoacromial arch consists of the coracoid 
process, the coracoacromial ligament and the acromion. The su- 
praspinatus and biceps tendons lie beneath the arch. Impinge­
ment generally occurs against the anterior edge of the acromion
13and the coracoacromial ligament as described by Neer (1972) .
The greater tuberosity impinges against the lateral acromion 
and underneath the acromioclavicular joint with progressive ab­
duction as, for example, occurs in the freestyle stroke.
In addition, Rathbun and MacNab (1970) demonstrated areas 
of avascularity in the supraspinatus and biceps tendons when 
held in the dependent position in which position both tendons are 
used1* ’. It is felt that the irritation caused by the mechanical 
impingement of the avascular region of the supraspinatus leads
to a tendinitis, which may progress to secondary involvement of
5 8the biceps tendon and rotator cuff tears '
ANTERIOR GLENOID LABRUM DAMAGE
This lesion may result from anterior subluxation which may 
damage the labrum. This can occur as a result of the swimmer's 
arm motions and increased capsular laxity which may cause 
subclinical anterior subluxation which damages the anterior 
glenoid labrum. The patient presents with pain and a click on 
adduction and internal rotation as the lesion produces compres-

INCIDENCE
The incidence of shoulder pain in competitive swimmers in 
North America has been established by surveys.
The study by McMaster and Troup (1993) differentiated be­
tween swimmers currently experiencing shoulder pain and those
who had suffered from shoulder pain at any time during their
11swimming careers . Whereas 38% to 75% had a "history of pain
at some time", only 9% to 35% experienced "current pain".
The findings of McMaster and Troup11 and Richardson, Jobe 
17 7and Collins are in sharp contrast to those of Kennedy et al .  It is
possible that the swimmers surveyed in the cross-Canada analy­
sis, although swimming competitively, were not of the same 
calibre as those assessed in the United States studies. It is reason­
able to expect the percentage of shoulder injuries to be higher in 
the elite swimmers as the distances swum in training will be 
greater and the length of time for which they have been training 
greater.
PREDISPOSING FACTORS  
AGE OF ONSET OF SHOULDER PAIN
The average age at commencement of competitive swimming
ranges from 7,3 to 8,5 years11.
Neither the 1980 or the 1993 USA studies specify the age at
which the swimmers first presented with shoulder pain. The
survey by McMaster and Troup (1993) indicates that 55% of boys
and 38% of girls in the NAG group (13-14 years old) already had
a history of shoulder pain.
11McMaster.and Troup stated that the average age of referral 
for initial complaints of the shoulder is 18 years.
SEX OF SWIMMERS
A greater percentage of men experienced shoulder problems
than women ' . The higher incidence of shoulder pain in men
may be explained by a number of factors.
Reduced buoyancy, coupled with the more rapid and ballistic
arm motions of the male swimmer result in a greater torque
applied through the shoulder joint and greater body drag during
propulsion through the water. These differences necessitate the
generation of a greater pull-through strength (lift) by the male 
10,11swimmerNinety-two percent of swimmers presenting with shoulder
pain swam freestyle, butterfly or backstroke in competition and
90% also identified one of these three strokes as their second best 
17stroke as well . This concurs with the findings of the Cross-Can- 
ada survey , in which the shoulder complaints were caused pri­
marily by the freestyle and butterfly strokes and occasionally by 
the backstroke, although an exact breakdown of percentages was 
unavailable.
Swimmers surveyed in McMaster and Troup's study indicated
that the butterfly stroke was the most painful to perform because
11of the force required to lift the body out of the water .  
UNILATERAL VS BILATERAL PAIN
17The swimmers surveyed by Richardson et al ranged in age 
from 14 to 23 years. The numbers complaining of bilateral pain in 
McMaster and Troup's11 study are significantly higher in the 
NAG and SED groups which have swimmers who have presum­
ably been swimming competitively for only 5-8 years.

SIDE OF PAIN
17Richardson et al demonstrated that 53% of swimmers com­
plained of pain in their right shoulder and 32% suffered from left 
sided pain.
Ciullo and Stevens (1989) found that 60% of swimmers per­
forming freestyle developed pain on the side on which they 
breathe, which is the dominant side of 81% of swimmers sur­
veyed2.
None of the other studies included in this review provided 
details of the side of pain.

Weight training has become an integral part of preparation for
12competition, but may contribute to shoulder pain . The pattern 
of movement used in weight training was not described. Some 
swimmers felt that the use of weights decreased shoulder pain. 
This is in contrast to the findings of McMaster and Troup11, where 
the respondents to their survey indicated that weight training 
increased the pain (Table IV).

Brady et al cautioned that weight training needs to be closely 
monitored and designed for the needs of the swimmer1. The 
patterns of movement during weight training need to be carefully 
taught. Caution needs to be exercised in the commencement of 
weight training in pre-adolescent swimmers. A number of swim­
mers begin weight training before the age of 10 which may be a
12cause of growth plate injuries .
RESISTANCE TRAINING
Resistance training is necessary to improve power and strength
after stroke techniques have been perfected.
Hand paddles are a popular method of resistance training. The
use of the hand paddle increases the load on muscles of the upper
extremity and increases the length of time spent in the pull-
18through phase . This phase, together with the recovery phase,
produced pain in 75% of the swimmers surveyed by Richard- 
17son . The remaining 25% experienced pain in either the pull-
through or recovery phase alone.
Of the groups surveyed by McMaster and Troup11 the use of
hand paddles ranged from 70% of the female SED group to 91%
of the elite male swimmers and was seen to aggravate shoulder
pain. The percentage of swimmers in which this occurred is seen
in Table IV. In Richardson's study, 81% of the swimmers found
17that the use of hand paddles aggravated their pain . Resistance 
training using surgical tubing appears to be less widely used, but 
again is reported to exacerbate shoulder pain15 (Table IV).
FLEXIBILITY
Greipp (1985) studied shoulder flexibility in a group of 168 
swimmers before the start of the swimming season in order to 
predict the incidence of shoulder pain. Results indicated that the 
poorer the shoulder flexibility the higher the incidence of shoul­
der pairA He suggested that posterior shoulder looseness could
be associated with his findings. The postural forward shoulder
4slump often seen in swimmers, tends to support this .
MUSCLE STRENGTH
The stroke mechanism emphasises internal rotation and ad­
duction of the shoulder and it is not surprising that swimmers 
show significantly greater torque values of these movements.
Warner et al (1990) indicated an increase in the internal/exter­
nal rotation ratios in patients suffering from impingement syn-
18drome, due to an increased internal rotation strength .
It is the rotator cuff muscles which provide dynamic humeral 
stability and prevent vertical displacement of the humeral head 
during elevation.
A significant muscle imbalance may therefore result in upward 
displacement of the humeral head resulting in impingement.
KICKBOARDS
The flexion and adduction of the shoulder which is required to 
hold the board may cause symptoms of impingement. (Table 
IV)17.
EVENT
The findings of Richardson et al indicate that shoulder pain is
17more common in sprinters and middle distance swimmers .Long distance swimmers swim further during practice , but the 
more forceful arm movements of the sprinter may cause impinge- 
ment of the supraspinatus tendon in the subacromial space .
CONCLUSION
South Africa's re-entrance to international sport competitions 
is likely to cause an increase in young participants with their 
sights set on the 1996 or 2000 Olympic Games.
Similar surveys to those performed by McMaster and Troup 
and Richardson et al would need to be carried out in South Africa 
to determine which of the risk factors detailed in the review are 
problematic in South African swimmers. The coaches, parents 
and swimmers would then need to be educated in order to 
increase their awareness regarding the prevention, early identifi­
cation and successful management of injuries that may occur.
