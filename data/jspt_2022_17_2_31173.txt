Back ground 
Para swimming has e xperienc ed increased participation in rec ent y ears. Injur y and injur y 
prevention research on P ara swimmers is lacking c ompared to swimmers without 
impairment. 
Purpose 
This study aimed to gather data in P ara swimmers on t ypical injuries, injur y pre vention 
programs, and at titudes to ward injur y and injur y pre vention in this population. 
Study Design 
Cross-sec tional, mix ed-methods design e valuating injuries, injur y management, and 
injur y pre vention in elite P ara swimmers in United States (U.S. ). 
Methods 
Para swimmers on the U.S. P aralympics Swimming National teams at multiple 
competition le vels w ere invited to c omplete an online sur vey. Qualitativ e inter views with 
six U.S. P aralympics National team P ara swimmers w ere c onduc ted to pro vide detail on 
athlete e xperienc es with injur y and pre vention. 
Results 
Twenty-one of 56 sur veys w ere returned: 11 of 21 participants (52.4%) reported 
experiencing an injur y that altered their w eekly training. All (21/21) reported 
participating in strength training and 19 of 21 (90.5%) reported inc orporating stretching 
into their training regimen, although strengthening/stretching regimens included 
routines that may no t hav e been specifically targeted to ward injur y pre vention. Six of 21 
(28.6%) reported participation in an injur y pre vention program. Qualitativ e inter view 
themes included the impac t of swimmers’ c ompensated body mechanics on injur y risk, 
the value of individualiz ed injur y pre vention programs, and the importanc e of 
knowledgeable c oaching and rehabilitation staff . 
Conclusions 
Injur y pre vention programs are important c omponents in P ara swimming training 
although the y are underutiliz ed based on responses in this study . These programs should 
be individualiz ed to address swimming biomechanics and athlete-specific impairments. 
Increasing c oaching kno wledge and ac cess to individualiz ed programs may reduc e injur y 
prevalenc e among this at -risk population.

INTR ODUC TION 
The P aralympic mo vement has gained significant momen -
tum o ver the past c entur y. The P aralympic Games includes 
athletes with various physical, visual, and intellec tual im -
pairments and hav e evolved into an elite le vel of c ompeti -
tion.1,2 The International P aralympic C ommit tee o versees 
the P aralympics, which has traditionally f ocused on elite 
sports perf ormanc e or helping individuals with disabilities 
train in sports to bec ome future elite athletes. 
Classification systems w ere de veloped and hav e evolved 
for each sport intending to mak e the c ompetition as fair 
as possible. The goal of classification is to group P ara ath -
letes who hav e a similar degree of sport -specific ac tivit y 
limitation from their impairment into a sport class.3 World 
Para Swimming go verns P aralympic Swimming classifica -
tion, and the classification proc ess results in three separate 
sport classes per athlete e valuation: a S class f or freest yle, 
backstrok e, and but terfly , a SB class f or breaststrok e, and a 
SM class f or individual medle y. For physical impairments, 
sport classes range from S1 through S10 / SB1 through SB9 
/ SM1 through SM10, with the lo wer numbers representing 
more se vere physical impairment/limitation in swimming.4 
The visual impairment sport classes range from S11/SB11/
SM11 through S13/SB13/SM13, with the lo wer numbers rep -
resenting more se vere vision impairment.4 Within each 
sport class, P ara swimmers may also hav e variabilit y in their 
swimming perf ormanc e, reflec tive of their training, e xperi -
ence, and inherent athleticism and no t impac ted b y their 
impairment, similar to ho w swimmers without disabilities 
may hav e var ying swimming perf ormanc e within an age 
group. One may assume that c ertain sport classes e xpe-
rienc e greater func tional limitations when injured due to 
their physical impairments, but this relationship remains 
unclear .5 
As the P aralympic mo vement gains increasing c ommer -
cial support and media c overage, more generations of indi -
viduals with disabilities are inspired to participate in sports. 
With the gro wing population of P ara athletes, there is an 
increased need to understand injur y epidemiology and in -
jury pre vention strategies f or P ara athletes. A qualitativ e 
study c onduc ted b y Fagher and c olleagues inter viewed 18 
Swedish P ara athletes representing 10 diff erent P ara sports 
and re vealed that P ara athletes’ vie ws of their sports-re -
lated injuries e xperienc es are c omple x, multifac torial, and 
distinc t from the perspec tives of athletes without disabil -
ities in terms of injur y causes, risk behavior , impac ts on 
func tion af ter injur y, psy chosocial stressors, and o verall 
consequenc es of injur y.6 For instanc e, one P ara athlete 
noted, “I’ m of ten thinking, what will happen if I get an in -
jury to my non-disabled side, I w ouldn’t be able to manage 
my daily lif e. That ’s what I’ m afraid of .”6 
Currently , most published P ara sports injur y epidemiol -
ogy data hav e been from the P aralympic Games.5,7–11 Stud -
ies from the Rio 2016 and London 2012 Summer P aralympic 
Games reported 8.5% - 12.4% of P ara swimmers had a cur -
rent injur y12 with the highest perc entage of injuries being acute (47%), f ollowed b y overuse (37%), and then acute on 
chronic (16%).12 Past studies hav e reported higher injur y 
rates in P ara swimmers, R eynolds and c olleagues f ound 69% 
of P ara swimmers on the British team reporting injuries 
during the Barc elona 1992 Summer P aralympic Games.13 
Outside of the elite c ompetition, there is a lack of published 
studies that include P ara swimmers and their injur y pat -
terns. T o our kno wledge, there hav e been no rec ent studies 
describing P ara swimmers’ injur y pat terns outside of the 
Paralympic Games. 
Due to the lack of published research on injuries and in -
jury pre vention specific to P ara swimming outside of the 
Paralympic Games, P ara swimmers of ten rely on current 
knowledge and e videnc e for injur y pre vention in swimmers 
without disabilities. Many injuries to swimmers without im -
pairment are at the shoulder and are c ommonly a result of 
overuse.14 Risk fac tors f or shoulder injuries in swimmers in -
clude high training v olumes, muscle fatigue/o verload (es -
pecially of the subscapularis and serratus anterior), ro tator 
cuff tendinosis, shoulder laxit y, and impingement positions 
during swim strok e.15 Injur y pre vention programs f or swim -
mers should include strengthening, stretching, and en -
duranc e training. It should also include strok e-specific in -
struc tion on body mechanics such as decreasing internal 
rotation of the shoulder during rec overy, breathing bilat -
erally , or shortening strok e follow-through.15,16 However, 
Para swimmers may hav e diff erent risk fac tors f or injuries 
compared to swimmers without disabilities due to P ara 
swimmers’ underlying impairments. For instanc e, depend -
ing on the P ara swimmer’ s underlying medical c ondition(s) 
and impairment(s), the y may hav e anatomical or func tional 
differenc es that alter swimming biomechanics, c ompen -
sator y biomechanics, and techniques to ac commodate their 
impairments but also increase the risk of an o veruse injur y. 
To bet ter understand injuries, injur y risk, and pre vention 
in P ara swimmers at all c ompetition le vels studies are 
needed outside of the P aralympic Games. Theref ore, the 
purpose of this study was to inv estigate U.S. P ara swimmers 
with physical or visual impairments at various c ompetition 
levels and (1) describe injuries related to P ara swimming, 
(2) understand athletes’ participation in injur y pre vention 
programs and the charac teristics of those programs, and (3) 
evaluate athletes’ perc eptions of injur y risk, c omplications, 
and treatment. 
METHODS 
Design : A cross-sec tional, mix ed-methods approach e val-
uating injuries, injur y management, and injur y pre vention 
related to P ara swimming in U.S. National team P ara swim -
mers was used f or this study . The first part of the study 
consisted of a one-time online sur vey. A pre vious sur vey 
developed f or P ara athletes was used to help guide the de -
velopment of the sur vey used in this study .17 Additionally , 
input from the U.S. Chief of P aralympic Sport and the U.S. 
Paralympics Swimming High-P erformanc e Direc tor was 
sought and the initial sur vey was pilo ted f or any f eedback Injur y and Injur y Prevention in United States P ara Swimming: A Mix ed-Methods Approach

derbilt Univ ersit y, Nashville, TN) was utiliz ed, hosted and 
distributed through Univ ersit y of South Carolina, (Appen -
dix 1). 
The sec ond part of the study c onsisted of qualitativ e 
semi-struc tured inter views via an audio visual c ommunica -
tion platf orm (Skype™). The inter view questions w ere de -
veloped b y the student inv estigators (JS, MM, SB) as a result 
of the sur vey responses and through c ollaboration with a 
board-c ertified Physical Medicine & R ehabilitation and 
Sports Medicine physician (ST) with a specialization in P ara 
Sports Medicine. The f ocus of the inter views was to gather 
comprehensiv e inf ormation on P ara swimmers’ perc eptions 
and e xperienc es with injuries, injur y pre vention, treatment, 
and the injur y rec overy proc ess. The inter view guide can be 
viewed in Appendix 2. 
PARTICIP ANTS : 
Surv ey: Participants w ere recruited through emails distrib -
uted b y the U.S. P aralympics Swimming High-P erformanc e 
Direc tor. Inclusion criteria c onsisted of: being able to c om-
plete the sur vey in English and being a member of the U.S. 
Paralympic Swimming National teams with either a physi -
cal or visual impairment. P articipants w ere e xcluded if the y 
were an athlete with an intellec tual impairment giv en con-
cern that the y would no t be able to appropriately c omplete 
the sur vey. Fif ty-six participants w ere identified b y the 
High-P erformanc e Direc tor f or recruitment, the goal was to 
have a sample siz e of at least 17 responses (response rate 
30.4%) sinc e on av erage, online sur veys yield a response 
rate betw een 20-30%.18,19 
Qualitativ e Intervie ws: P articipants w ere selec ted 
through a c onvenienc e sample of U.S. P ara swimmers on the 
U.S. P aralympics Swimming National teams. R esearchers 
requested the U.S. P aralympics Swimming High-P erfor-
manc e Direc tor pro vided purposeful sampling of P ara 
swimmers representing div ersit y in regards to primar y 
strok e, medical diagnoses, and impairments. Inclusion cri -
teria w ere: current U.S. P ara swimming National team 
members with either a physical or visual impairment under 
the direc tion of the direc tor. Upon the direc tor’s review of 
the team roster and discussions with the athletes, six P ara 
swimmers w ere selec ted based on the request in represent -
ing a div ersit y of P ara swimmers, schedule availabilit y, and 
willingness to participate in an inter view. The y were en -
couraged to also tak e the sur vey portion of the study but 
were no t excluded if the y did no t complete the sur vey. 
This study was re viewed and appro ved b y the Univ ersit y 
of South Carolina Institutional R eview Board (P ro00081813 
and P ro00084553). 
PROCEDURES: 
Surv ey: Fifty-six participants on the U.S. P aralympic Swim -
ming National teams w ere emailed the online sur vey. Email 
reminders w ere distributed af ter tw o weeks to remind par -
ticipants of the study , and each w eek f ollowing f or se ven 
weeks, af ter which the sur vey was closed. The general defin -
ition used f or injur y histor y reporting in this study was “ any 
injur y related to swimming that altered w eekly training or caused a P ara swimmer to miss a c ompetition, regardless of 
whether participants sought medical treatment f or the in -
jury.” 
Training:  Student inv estigators w ere trained in qualita -
tive inter view techniques b y author (ER), who is an e xpe-
rienc ed qualitativ e researcher , including open ended ques -
tions, f ollow up techniques and av oidanc e of leading 
questions. Student inv estigators prac ticed and w ere giv en 
feedback. 
Intervie ws: After the sur vey was closed, each of the three 
student inv estigators c ontac ted tw o of the six P ara swim -
mers b y email to arrange a one-on-one inter view over an 
audio visual c ommunication platf orm (Skype™). Audio vi-
sual inter views instead of audio-only w ere selec ted as this 
allowed f or a more personal inter view. The inter viewers 
provided the P ara swimmers with an e xplanation of the 
study and po tential inter view questions bef ore c onduc ting 
the inter view. The inter views w ere c onversational and 
semi-struc tured to allo w for in-dep th follow-up. Inter views 
lasted betw een 14 and 38 minutes. 
DATA ANAL YSIS: 
Surv ey Analysis : Statistical analysis was perf ormed using a 
statistical sof tware platf orm (IBM® SPSS® Statistics f or 
Windo ws, V ersion 26.0, Armonk, NY: IBM C orp). Descrip -
tive statistics including means, minimum, maximum, stan -
dard de viations, and frequencies w ere calculated f or the de -
pendent variables. 
Qualitativ e Analysis:  Each inter view was transcribed v er-
batim. De-identified transcrip ts from the inter views w ere 
input into qualitativ e data analysis sof tware (QSR Interna -
tional Pt y Ltd. (2019) NViv o, Version 12.3.0). Iterativ e the -
matic analysis20 was c ompleted in a c ollaborativ e proc ess 
by the three student inv estigators (JS, MM, SB) with support 
and re view by author (ER) with qualitativ e research e xper -
tise. The first inter view was c oded b y each of the three stu -
dent inv estigators individually , then discussed as a group 
with author (ER) to ensure c onsistency betw een researchers 
in the c oding proc ess. Initial c odes w ere c ompleted induc -
tively, remaining as close as possible to the participant ’s 
wording. Further iterations of the c oding w ere c ompleted 
as a group, with themes categoriz ed bo th deduc tively into 
predetermined categories (demographics, injur y, training, 
treatment) and induc tively through emergent identified 
new themes through group c onsensus. 
Further thematic breakdo wn under resultant categories 
were re viewed and re vised in se veral rounds b y all three stu -
dent researchers (JS, MM, SB) and author (ER), and the re -
sults w ere re viewed with authors (SH, ST). T rustw orthiness 
was established through c omparison to sur vey results (tri -
angulation) and utilizing a mentor with qualitativ e exper -
tise.21

PARTICIP ANT INFORMA TION 
The mean age of sur vey participants was 19.4 y ears (range 
14-30). P articipants reported swimming c ompetitiv ely f or a 
mean of 8.4 y ears (range 2-17). Demographics of sur vey par -
ticipants are presented in Table 1 . Only three (14.3%) swim -
mers reported c ompeting in additional sports o ther than 
swimming (sho t put, P ara triathlon, and archer y). The most 
common primar y swimming strok e reported was freest yle 
(57.1%). 
IN AND OUT OF P OOL TRAINING INFORMA TION 
Participants reported swimming an av erage of 15.62 (SD 
3.57) hours per w eek. All reported perf orming cross-train -
ing, with an av erage of 4.10 (SD 2.32) hours per w eek. When 
combining to tal hours of cross-training and swimming, par -
ticipants av eraged a to tal of 19.71 (SD 4.33) hours of to tal 
training per w eek. All of the sur vey participants reported

monly pro vided b y the swim c oach (32%), athletic trainer or 
strength c oach (26% each), a c ombination of bo th a swim 
coach and athletic trainer (11%), and a c ombination of a 
swim c oach and physical therapist (5%). All 19 participants 
reported rec eiving c orrec tion of improper f orm during 
strength training. When determining the amount of w eight 
used f or strength training, 14 (67%) reported the amount 
of resistanc e was determined on an individual basis, nine 
(43%) reported the swimmer decides the amount of resis -
tanc e, three (14%) reported using their body weight, tw o 
(9.5%) used a predetermined repetition maximum and one 
(4.8%) reported all swimmers on the team use the same 
amount of w eight. All but one participant reported using 
some t ype of resistanc e training in the pool. The t ypes of 
in-pool resistanc e reported b y participants can be vie wed in 
Table 3 . Nineteen of 21 (90.5%) participants reported inc or-
porating stretching into their training regimen. Strength -
ening/stretching programs reported b y participants in -
cluded routines that may no t hav e been specifically targeted 
toward injur y pre vention sinc e the interpretation of “injur y 
prevention” was lef t up to the respondent. 
INJUR Y HIST ORY 
Of the 21 sur vey participants, 11 (52.4%) reported e xperi -
encing an injur y during their swimming career that altered 
their w eekly training, with fiv e (23.8%) reporting shoulder 
injuries as the cause of missed time. Six of the 21 swimmers 
(28.6%) reported missing c ompetitions due to injur y, with an av erage of 1.5 c ompetitions missed. Of the swimmers 
who reported an injur y that altered their w eekly training, 8 
trained 15-21 hours/w eek, 2 trained 8-14 hours/w eek, and 
one trained ≤7 hours/w eek. Freest yle (n=12) was reported as 
the most c ommon primar y strok e (57%). Eight (66.7%) who 
identified freest yle as their primar y strok e reported an in -
jury that altered w eekly training, whereas f our (33.3%) re -
ported missing c ompetition due to injur y. Tw o swimmers 
(9.5%) reported having had pre vious surger y related to a 
swimming injur y. Of the six male sur vey participants, tw o 
(33.3%) reported injuries that altered w eekly training, while 
nine (60%) of the 15 f emales reported injuries that altered 
weekly training. 
Any mechanisms of injur y reported w ere classified as 
acute (defined as any injur y that was caused b y a specific, 
identifiable e vent related to P ara swimming ac tivities), 
chronic (defined as any injur y that de veloped o ver days, 
weeks, or months and was no t associated with an acute 
event), or unkno wn chronicit y (if the participant did no t 
provide enough inf ormation in their sur vey response to 
classify the injur y as acute or chronic). Table 4  provides 
an o verview of injur y charac teristics described b y partici -
pants, categoriz ed b y the eligible impairment t ypes of P ara 
swimmers. Of the fiv e respondents with short stature, f our 
(80%) reported an injur y that altered their w eekly training 
and three (60%) missed c ompetition due to their injur y. The 
shoulder was the most c ommonly reported body area across 
multiple impairment categories. Injur y and Injur y Prevention in United States P ara Swimming: A Mix ed-Methods Approach

Eight of 21 participants (38.1%) reported having current 
pain with an av erage intensit y rating of 3.4 (SD 0.89), (on a 
0 to 10 numerical rating scale, with 0 representing no pain 
and 10 representing the most se vere pain). P articipants e x-
periencing pain reported the location of their current pain 
as follows: 23.8% reported pain in the shoulder , 9.5% in the 
arm, 9.5% in the upper back and lo wer back, and 4.8% in the 
abdomen, elbo w, hip, and knee. 
INJUR Y PREVENTION PR OGR AMS AND TREA TMENT 
Six (28.6%) of the 21 participants reported participation in 
an injur y pre vention program, with f our of the six (66.7%) 
reporting injur y. Seven (46.7%) of the 15 participants who 
did no t participate in an injur y pre vention program re -
ported having a histor y of an injur y. Injur y pre vention pro -
grams (as interpreted b y the participant) ranged from a pro -
gram at a national team camp to an individualiz ed program 
that included stretching and strengthening 45 minutes each 
morning to pre vent shoulder and hip injur y. 
Nine (42.9%) of the 21 sur vey participants reported re -
ceiving physical therap y treatment due to injur y, 9 (42.9%) 
reported rec eiving chiroprac tic treatment, 10 (47 .6%) re -
ported rec eiving a massage due to injur y, and 4 (19%) re -
ported rec eiving no treatment at all. T reatments included 
kinesio tape (n=9, 42.9%), cupping (n=7 , 33.3%), ASTYM 
(n=4, 19%), elec trical stimulation (n=8, 38.1%), massage 
(n=16, 76.2%), pneumatic c ompression (n=7 , 33.3%), and 
manual therap y (n=8, 38.1%). Three (14.3%) participants re -
sponded to an open-ended question on the sur vey regard -
ing any additional inf ormation on swimming and swimming 
injur y as it pertains to their personal e xperienc es and re -
ported the y had impro vement of symp toms f ollowing the 
implementation of stretching and strengthening programs. 
PART II. INTER VIEW RESUL TS 
Six P ara swimmers who w ere U.S. P aralympics Swimming 
resident team members and at least 18 y ears old partici -
pated in the qualitativ e inter views, with demographics pre -
sented in Table 5 . 
Para swimmers inter viewed represented bo th genders 
with div erse impairments and classification sport classes. 
The resultant themes from the inter views w ere categoriz ed 
into f our main topic categories: training, injur y risk, in -
 
juries, and treatment and return to sport ( Figure 2 ). 
Training Theme*: T raining is individualiz ed and requires 
knowledgeable c oaching and support personnel:* Inter vie-
wees no ted the wide array of physical impairments mak es 
the at titudes and beliefs to wards training and injur y var y 
betw een individuals in P ara swimming. All 6 participants 
reported c oaches, medical staff , and training personnel 
have an impac t on their swimming career and that having 
access to a c omprehensiv e, multidisciplinar y team and re -
sourc es was important f or their training needs. As no ted b y 
Participant 06: 
“Para athletes [need to] kno w that the y’re on that same 
elite le vel [as athletes without disabilities] and the y 
need those same … rec overy tools or … , pre vention 
techniques. … That ’s just something that I’v e realiz ed 
since, … making my first National team is I need those 
things just lik e an able-bodied athlete does, maybe just 
in a diff erent way .” 
Para swimmers also rec ogniz ed the value of having their 
training super vised b y someone officially trained and e x-
perienc ed in w orking with athletes with disabilities who 
could rec ogniz e and understand the balanc e betw een allo w-
ing them to be resilient and push, but no t overdo it to the 
point that risks injur y. As per P articipant 04: 
“I’m very thankful to hav e coaches watching me and 
making sure I’ m doing the proper technique. … that 
was especially a big thing in therap y. I really had to Injur y and Injur y Prevention in United States P ara Swimming: A Mix ed-Methods Approach
International Journal of Sports Physic al Therapy
have somebody help me because I used a lo t of c ompen -
sation methods that I ne ver realiz ed that I did until I 
was in therap y and I was supposed to be doing isolated 
exercises and I w ould c ompensate a ton. So the y had to 
work really hard with me and help me to, to no t com-
pensate. ” 
As is the case f or all athletes, inter viewees also no ted it 
is important f or Para swimmers to gradually return to their 
training regimens af ter a hiatus to av oid injuries. Some in -
terviewees reported that time off from swimming may im -
pact Para swimmers more than swimmers without disabil -
ities, further emphasizing the importanc e of cross-training 
and participation in o ther ac tivities. 
Injur y Risk Theme: Injury risk is unique in P ara swimmers 
based on their underlying medic al conditions, impairments, 
and adaptations to ac commodate for their impairments : As 
per P articipant 03: 
“I think at the same time there was no real way f or me 
to get the same range of mo tion or pull do wn my right 
arm in order to match my lef t arm, which w ould hav e 
led to … ano ther f orm of … c ompensation injur y.” 
Some P ara swimmers reported the y learned to do their 
pre-habilitation or injur y pre vention programs based on 
their personal e xperienc e. Swimmers with visual impair -
ment who require tappers also hav e to de velop strong re -
lationships with their tappers to anticipate the wall of the 
pool and pre vent injur y. Ho wever, most swimmers do no t 
get a chanc e to prac tice with their tappers until the time 
surrounding a c ompetition. 
Injuries Theme: Para swimmers, c ompared to swimmers 
without disabilities, may experienc e a greater impact from 
their injuries on their daily liv es: Inter viewees reflec ted that 
Para swimmers, c ompared to swimmers without disabili -
ties, may f eel a more significant impac t from injuries as 
some P ara swimmers reported the water and swimming im -
proved their func tion and e veryday symp toms from their 
underlying disabilities. As per P articipant 06: 
“The water … mak es my body f eel bet ter and … I don’t 
feel as stiff and … don’t e xperienc e as many aches and 
pains as I do … when I’ m no t in the water . So when 
there is an injur y … pre venting me from being in the 
water , … it definitely mak es me upset. [ …and] sad. 
[Be]cause it aff ects me a lo t and I f eel lik e … it aff ects 
me a lo t more than it w ould [aff ect] an able-bodied 
swimmer .” 
Inter viewees also reported that their injuries can bo th be 
preventable and unpre ventable due to unique risk fac tors 
from their underlying medical c onditions. Injur y symp toms 
and clinical presentation may be at ypical due to some P ara 
swimmers’ underlying disabilities and their subsequent in -
creased resilienc e and pain toleranc e. 
Treatment Theme: Intervie wees reported both mix ed expe -
rienc es with medic al treatment of their injuries and return to 
sport rec ommendations, with negativ e experienc es causing sig -
nificant barriers in their P ara swimming c areer:  One inter vie-
wee no ted that replacing swimming with ano ther ac tivit y 
is sometimes more helpful when rec overing from injur y or 
taking time off . Inter viewees also e xpressed ho w swimming 
itself aids in the rec overy proc ess and ho w it assists with strengthening. Injuries as se vere as frac tures w ere no ted b y 
one inter viewee with osteogenesis imperf ecta and w ere no t 
enough to hold her out of the pool f or more than 3 days. 
Inter viewees reported bo th positiv e and negativ e experi -
ences and inc onsistencies with medical care of their injuries 
- times when all of their specific medical needs w ere met 
due to great c ommunication, but also when c onflic ting staff 
opinions limited training unnec essarily . Participant 01 and 
03 summariz ed: 
Participant 01: “the staff at [location omit ted] … was 
sometimes more of an obstacle than a help … their 
head of a Sports Medicine didn’t want me back in the 
pool af ter I had a pret ty good at tack. One day the y 
called the ambulanc e, the whole 9 yards. … And I [told] 
him [that] my neurologist cleared me, neurologist said 
[I’m] fine, [I’ m] cleared to go… I can remember that re -
ally hurt my training pret ty bad. ” 
Participant 03: “Injuries that w ere no t caught … in time 
or misdiagnosed. So … w e’ve had to limit what w e can 
and can’t do as far as strok es. … W e were doing the 
wrong rehab program f or quite some time, so w e were 
only aggravating that initial injur y to begin with. .” 
DISCUSSION 
This study utiliz ed a mix ed-methods approach producing 
valuable data and perspec tives on injuries, treatment, train -
ing prac tices, and participation in injur y pre vention in elite 
U.S. P ara swimmers with physical and/or visual impair -
ments. These results indicate that P ara swimmers e xperi -
ence injuries at similar rates to swimmers without impair -
ments. Additionally , the results of this study sho w there is 
a lack of injur y pre vention programs being utiliz ed b y Para 
swimmers and that individual P ara swimmers hav e unique 
needs due to their disabilities and impairments. 
The most c ommon site of injur y in the athletes in the 
current study was the shoulder , which is c onsistent with 
other studies that f ocused on P ara swimmers,22 Para ath -
letes across a variet y of sports,8,10,12 and swimmers without 
disabilities.16,23 The perc entage of U.S. P ara swimmers re -
porting injuries in our sur vey was higher than what has 
been reported in o ther studies.10,12 However, it is difficult 
to compare the present study to o thers because of diff er-
ences in methodology , including data sourc es and ho w “in -
jury” was defined. Derman and c olleagues e valuated 
prospec tive cohort data from a to tal of 3657 athletes from 
78 countries at the Rio 2016 Summer P aralympic Games.10 
The authors reported that within the sport of P ara swim -
ming 42 of the 492 P ara swimmers (8.5% ) sustained injuries 
during the Rio 2016 P aralympic Games.10 Whether injuries 
were acute, acute on chronic, or chronic was no t reported 
specifically f or P ara swimming. Willick and c olleagues e x-
amined 62 injuries in P ara swimmers (12.4% of all P ara 
swimmers) during the London 2012 P aralympic Games. Of 
these injuries, 47% w ere reported to be “ acute ” and 16% 
were reported to be “ acute on chronic. ”12 
The current study’ s retrospec tive data was no t specific 
to one e vent or time point, but rather across the partici -
pants’ careers as c ompetitiv e Para swimmers. While studies 
conduc ted b y Derman10 and Willick12 reported prospec tive 
data from a much larger sample siz e during the duration of Injur y and Injur y Prevention in United States P ara Swimming: A Mix ed-Methods Approach
International Journal of Sports Physic al Therapy
a single P aralympic Games, this present study is the first 
to report data e xclusiv ely from U.S. P ara swimmers, specif -
ically gathering data about injuries that impac ted w eekly 
training throughout the swimmer’ s career . This present 
study f ocused on injuries that altered w eekly training or 
competition participation, while studies c onduc ted b y Der -
man10 and Willick12 included injuries that may no t hav e al-
tered w eekly training or c ompetition participation. 
The participants in the present study reported more 
chronic than acute injuries c ompared to the those included 
in P aralympic Games injur y sur veillanc e studies, which 
could be e xplained b y gathering injur y histor y data that 
may no t hav e needed medical at tention. Thus, the present 
survey may hav e been more sensitiv e in cap turing chronic 
injuries c ompared to Derman10 and Willick12 studies. This 
is especially true if P ara athletes are more lik ely to seek 
medical at tention f or acute injuries and no t for chronic in -
juries at the Games, which may oc cur f or multiple reasons. 
As reported b y participants in this study , Para swimmers 
may hav e a c omplicated medical histor y and some hav e re-
ported negativ e experienc es when seeking medical care f or 
symp toms leading to unnec essar y training/c ompetition re -
stric tions. The qualitativ e inter view discussion about in -
juries no ted a c ommon theme reflec ting P ara swimmers’ 
beliefs that time in the water impro ved their func tion in 
everyday lif e. Theref ore, time away from the pool due to in -
jury may be of greater detriment f or P ara swimmers than 
swimmers without disabilities. Fear of repeat negativ e ex-
perienc es may disc ourage P ara swimmers from seeking 
medical care until absolute nec essar y, such as in acute in -
juries causing significant pain or func tional limitations, or 
only when chronic injuries hav e been e xacerbated and c ome 
to a point where the y are no longer tolerable. Further e vi-
denc e is needed to understand the impac t of an injur y on 
various psy chosocial, func tional, and sports participation 
outc omes in P ara swimmers c ompared to swimmers with -
out disabilities. 
Current guidelines proposed f or injur y pre vention in 
swimmers without disabilities suggest that strength train -
ing be super vised b y a c ertified strength and c onditioning 
specialist, athletic trainer , or physical therapist to pre vent 
injur y.24 There are no published guidelines f or those with 
impairments/disabilities. Most sur vey participants in our 
study (90.5%) reported super vision of their out of pool re -
sistanc e training, with 61.9% being at least oc casionally su -
pervised b y an athletic trainer , strength c oach, or physical 
therapist, theref ore meeting guidelines f or best prac tice of 
strength training, at least ac cording to literature f or ath -
letes without disabilities.24 The majorit y of sur vey partici -
pants (90.5%) also c ompleted stretching as part of their reg -
ular training routine, which is in alignment with current 
recommendations f or swimmers without disabilities.16 
However, sinc e bo th of these strengthening and stretching 
guidelines w ere created f or swimmers without disabilities 
in mind, further research is needed to e valuate eff ective 
techniques f or strengthening and stretching specifically in 
Para swimmers, with c onsideration of the broad spec trum 
of medical diagnoses, impairments, and func tional abilities 
Para swimmers represent. 
Although many of the sur vey participants reported per -
forming resistanc e and stretching programs, while 15 (71.4%) reported the y did no t participate in a specific injur y 
prevention program, half of this group reported an injur y. 
Out of the remaining sur vey participants who did partici -
pate in an injur y pre vention program, 66.7% of these partic -
ipants still reported an injur y. In swimmers without disabil -
ities, there are proposed algorithms f or injur y pre vention, 
including careful monitoring of training v olume, intensit y, 
and duration b y coaches and physicians while also looking 
out f or strok e alterations that c ould represent c ompensa -
tion f or pain or injur y.16 It is also rec ommended that swim -
mers without disabilities in general w ork on enduranc e 
training (strengthening, stabilization, and fle xibilit y) of 
core muscles to av oid e xcessiv e anterior pelvic tilt and lum -
bar lordosis, and also f ocus on scapular strengthening be -
fore primar y rotator cuff muscles strengthening as part of 
their injur y pre vention program.16 However, due to the 
uniqueness of each P ara swimmer , the results of the present 
study highlight that an injur y pre vention plan should in -
clude individual analyses of the P ara swimmers’ biome -
chanics and a strong understanding of ho w their underlying 
medical c ondition impac ts their mo vements in the water , 
fatigue, and risk of injur y. Those that participated in the 
qualitativ e portion of this study also emphasiz ed the value 
of having support from a multidisciplinar y team w ell-e xpe-
rienc ed in w orking with P ara athletes. In c ollaboration with 
the P ara athlete, c oach(es), and o ther healthcare special -
ists (e.g. sports psy chologist, nutritionist, etc. ), such indi -
vidualiz ed injur y pre vention programs c ould be prescribed 
by physiatrists, sports medicine physicians, physical thera -
pists, and/or athletic trainers e xperienc ed in e valuating the 
needs of the P ara athlete. 
LIMIT ATIONS 
The small sample siz e of this study limits the abilit y to 
generaliz e the results, and pre vents detailed analysis b y in-
dividual impairment t ypes and sport classes f or classifica -
tion. Further limitations included the po tential f or response 
bias and having to rely on the participant ’s understanding 
and interpretation of their injur y diagnosis. Injur y pre va-
lenc e or incidenc e was no t able to be calculated from the 
data as the sur vey did no t define a time period f or partic -
ipants to report injuries. A specific definition f or “injur y” 
and “injur y pre vention program” also was no t pro vided to 
survey participants, possibly leading to diff erent interpre -
tations of what entails an injur y or injur y pre vention pro -
gram, and o ver-or under -reporting of each. Moreo ver, the 
survey inquired about injuries that altered w eekly training 
versus injur y that caused the participant to miss a c ompe -
tition, but did no t gather data about injuries that did no t 
result in these c onsequenc es, thus po tentially underrepre -
senting the injur y histor y of P ara swimmers in our study . 
CONCLUSION 
Injuries that alter w eekly training are c ommon in U.S. P ara 
swimmers, although only a small number participate in in -
jury pre vention programs. Qualitativ e results re vealed that 
many P ara swimmers belie ve the y experienc e injuries based 
on their specific impairments and c ompensations. Injur y 
prevention programs should be specifically designed f or in -Injur y and Injur y Prevention in United States P ara Swimming: A Mix ed-Methods Approach
