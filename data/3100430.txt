The purpose of this study was to determine the usual circumstances surrounding spinal cord
injuries that occur in swimming pools so that appropriate primary prevention programs
targeted at high risk persons, activities, and environments could be developed and initiated. A
sample of 341 persons enrolled in the National Spinal Cord Injury Statistical Center database
since 1973 whose injury was the result of a swimming pool mishap was identiﬁed. Medical
records were reviewed retrospectively and a survey questionnaire was administered by
telephone to 196 persons (57.5%) who were located and agreed to participate. Average age at
time of injury was 24 years, 86% of injured persons were men, 95% were white, 70% were
never married, 32% had less than a high school education, and only 7% were college
graduates. Almost all injuries (87%) occurred in private/residential pools. Most injuries (57%)
occurred when diving into less than 4 feet of water, while an additional 38% occurred at water
depths between 4 and 8 feet. Depth indicators were not present in 75% of cases. There were
no warning signs posted in 87% of cases. There was no lifeguard on duty in 94% of cases.
There was self-reported alcohol involvement in 49% of cases, but drugs were involved in only
2% of cases. Almost half of all injuries (46%) occurred during parties. In 44% of cases, the
injury occurred during the person’s ﬁrst visit to that particular pool. Ordinary dives accounted
for 70% of cases, followed by unusual dives (17%), unintentional pushes (6%), and other
circumstances (7%). Almost all injuries (88%) occurred between 1 pm and 1 am with the
most frequent time of day being 6 pm, and 82% occurred during June, July or August. Over
half (51%) of all injuries occurred on Saturday or Sunday. These results provide important
clues to the development of a successful primary prevention program.

Introduction
Since 1973, diving mishaps have accounted for 8.5% of
spinal cord injuries (SCI) in the United States.1This
makes diving mishaps the fourth leading cause of SCI
in the United States behind only motor vehicle crashes,
gunshot wounds, and falls.1Diving mishaps are also
among the leading causes of SCI in other countries. In
decreasing order, diving mishaps have accounted for
23.5% of SCI in Novosibirsk, Russia,214% in
Brisbane, Australia,311.9% in Toronto, Canada,4
10.5% in Perth, Australia,57% in Romania,66% in
Denmark,75.1% in Heidelberg, Germany,83.8% in the
Rhone-Alpes region of France,92.5% in Portugal,10
but only 1.3% in Japan.11,12Although the percentage
of total SCI was not reported, diving mishaps cause
19.8% of all cervical SCI in Poland.13
Several previous investigators have documented the
demographic and epidemiologic proﬁle of persons who
sustain an SCI as a result of a diving mishap.5,8,13 – 23
These injuries almost always occur among males
between 15 and 25 years of age. The neurologicallevel of injury is almost always in the C4 – C6 range,
and the injury is usually neurologically complete.
However, there is a paucity of recent information on
the circumstances surrounding these injuries that
might lead to the development of e/C128ective interven-
tions aimed at their prevention. Therefore, this study
was designed to ﬁll that void.
Methods
The National Spinal Cord Injury Statistical Center
(NSCISC) database was used to identify possible study
subjects. A complete listing of eligibility criteria for
enrollment in this database has been published
previously.24The main criteria are that the person
must have been treated at a federally designated model
regional SCI center since 1973 and that treatment must
have occurred within 60 days of injury (within 365 days
of injury for persons injured before October 1986). It
has been estimated that among all persons in the
United States each year who get SCI and survive long
enough to be hospitalized, approximately 15% are
enrolled in this database.1In general, it has been Correspondence: MJ DeVivoSpinal Cord (1997) 35, 509 ± 515

shown that persons enrolled in this database are
representative of all new cases of SCI that occur in
the United States each year with the exception that
neurologically complete injuries are somewhat over-
represented. Nonwhites and males may also be slightly
overrepresented.1
The NSCISC database contains information on
demographic and injury characteristics of each
person, acute care and rehabilitation information and
follow-up information that is collected annually. The
etiology of injury variable has a code for diving
mishaps, but does not distinguish between injuries
occurring in swimming pools and natural aquatic
environments. Therefore, all persons ( n=1106) en-
rolled in the NSCISC database since 1973 by one of
the 13 currently active model SCI centers whose injury
was the result of a diving mishap and who had not
been reported as deceased at the time of their most
recent annual follow-up were identiﬁed. The medical
records of these individuals were reviewed to ascertain
whether the injury occurred in a swimming pool.
Attempts were then made to contact by phone all
persons who were found to have been injured in a
swimming pool and all persons for whom the location
of injury could not be determined from medical
records. A survey questionnaire was then adminis-
tered by phone to all persons who were successfully
contacted, who were injured in swimming pools, and
who agreed to participate.
Of the original 1106 diving injuries, 631 (57.1%)
occurred in natural aquatic environments, 341 (30.8%)
occurred in swimming pools and 134 (12.1%) occurred
in unknown locations among persons whose where-
abouts were unknown or who could not be contacted by
phone. Of the 341 injuries that occurred in swimming
pools, 196 (57.5%) completed surveys were obtained.
The survey contained 21 questions with possible
responses in either a yes/no or multiple choice format
and took approximately 10 min to complete. Addi-
tional information on the date of injury, as well as
demographic and injury characteristics that was already
included in the NSCISC database was also used.
Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics such
as frequencies and percentages, cross-tabulations,
means and standard deviations. To facilitate the
interpretation of percentages, although the frequency
of unknown responses for each item is listed, these
unknown responses were excluded from the calculation
of percentages under the assumption that unknown
responses would be distributed in the same propor-
tions as those that were known.
Results
Demographic characteristics of the persons who
responded to the questionnaire appear in Table 1.
Average age at the time of injury was 24 years (median
age=22, range=11 – 56), 86% of injured persons were
men, 95% were white, 70% were never married, 32%
had less than a high school education, and only 7%
were college graduates. Over half (53.2%) the injuredpersons were employed at the time of injury, 34.4%
were students and 11.7% were unemployed. By
comparison, when all persons enrolled in the NSCISC
database regardless of cause of injury are considered,
the mean age at the time of injury is 31, 82% are men,
70% are white, 54% were never married, 59.6% were
employed, 18.5% were students, 14.3% were unem-
ployed, 41% have less than a high school education
and 8% were college graduates.1Therefore, persons
whose SCI is the result of a diving mishap are younger,
more likely to be white males, less well educated and
more likely to never have been married (perhaps
because of their younger age) than other persons with
SCI.
More injuries occurred in below ground swimming
pools (64%) than in above ground swimming pools
(36%). Additional circumstances surrounding these
injuries appear in Table 2. Almost all injuries (86.7%)
occurred in private residential pools. Most injuries

on duty in 93.8% of cases. No diving device was used
in 76.8% of cases. There was self-reported alcohol
involvement in 48.9% of cases, but drugs wereinvolved in only 2.2% of cases. Almost half (46.1%)
of all injuries occurred during parties. In fact, other
people are virtually always present at the time of the
injury (97.4%) perhaps because these injuries would
usually result in death unless someone else was there
to provide assistance. In 44.0% of cases, the injury
occurred during the person’s ﬁrst visit to that
particular pool, and in 27.8% of cases, the injury
resulted from the person’s ﬁrst dive into that pool.
Ordinary dives accounted for 69.7% of injuries,
followed by unusual dives (16.8%), unintentional
pushes (6.0%) and other circumstances (7.0%). Only
one injury (0.5%) was caused intentionally.
Almost all injuries (88%) occurred between 1 pm and
1 am with the most frequent time of day being 6 pm
(Figure 1). Over half (52.1%) of all injuries occurred
during daylight hours, while 10.8% occurred during
twilight (dusk) and 37.1% occurred in darkness (Table
2). Artiﬁcial lighting was generally not present (52.8%)
or turned o/C128 (17.4%). When artiﬁcial lighting was
turned on, it was inadequate for the situation ( n=24)
almost as often as it was adequate ( n=29) (Table 2).
Almost all injuries (82%) occurred during the
summer months of June, July and August when
outdoor temperatures are warmer and daylight lasts
longer (Figure 2). In contrast, when all spinal cord
injuries in the NSCISC database regardless of cause
are considered, only 33% occurred during these 3
months.1
Over half (51%) of SCI resulting from diving
mishaps occurred on Saturday or Sunday, with an

traumatic pneumothorax were infrequent occurrences
among persons injured in diving mishaps.
Average inpatient length of stay for initial acute
care and rehabilitation was 141 days ( +77 days), while
the average hospital charges for acute care and
rehabilitation in 1994 dollars were $192,414
(+$151,686). Although most persons (67.9%) had
private health insurance to cover these expenses, many
other persons rely on public funding programs such as
Medicaid (22.2%) and state departments of vocational
rehabilitation (6.8%). Almost all persons were
discharged from rehabilitation to a private residence
in the community, with only one person being
discharged to a nursing home and only one person
being discharged to another hospital.
Discussion
The mechanism of SCI resulting from diving into water
has been a subject of debate in the literature. The usual
type of injury found in most studies appears to result
from compression, suggesting that injuries occur when
the person’s head hits the bottom of the pool.13,14,17,25
However, Kewalramani et al found diving injuries
resulted in only 20% burst fractures and 80% wedge or
teardrop fractures, indicating ﬂexion type injuries that
they believe occur on impact with the water rather than
the bottom of the pool.18,19In the current study,
information on the mechanism of injury was not
collected. This issue requires further study, because
identiﬁcation of the most appropriate prevention
strategies depends in part on knowing exactly how
these injuries occur.
The circumstances surrounding spinal cord injuries
occurring in swimming pools do not appear to have
changed during the past two decades. In a study of
injuries occurring prior to 1976, Green et al found that
72% of spinal cord injuries occurring in swimming
pools took place in shallow water (less than 5 feet).22
Moreover, depth indicators were not present in 49%
of cases, no person responsible for the pool area was
present in 75% of cases, 64% of injured persons had
little or no familiarity with that particular pool, there
were no warning signs in 63% of cases, there was
inadequate lighting in 13% of cases, and only 18% of
cases involved the use of a diving board.22All of these
ﬁndings are relatively consistent with those of the
current study.
These results provide important clues to the
development of a successful primary prevention
program for spinal cord injuries that occur in
swimming pools. The most appropriate target popula-
tion for such a program would appear to be younger
aged white males with high school education or less
who quite often are still students. These demographic
ﬁndings are consistent with several other studies of
SCI resulting from diving mishaps.14,16,18,22
Educational interventions might be coordinated
with local school systems to increase awareness of
the potential risks and safety precautions to minimizethose risks. The educational message might focus on
becoming familiar with the pool and making sure the
depth of the pool is known before diving, avoiding
alcohol when using swimming pools, not using pools
during darkness, teaching proper diving technique,
being careful about trying unusual types of dives, and
not using the pool alone. The consequences of SCI
resulting from diving mishaps could also be part of the
education message.
Pool owners also have a responsibility to provide
the safest possible environment for persons who use
the pool. Educational programs for pool owners
should focus on the need for adequate fencing to
keep people away from the pool at inappropriate
hours, providing adequate lighting during hours when
the pool is to be used, having adequately trained
supervision or a lifeguard present, particularly during
parties, and having visible and understandable depth
indicators located strategically around the pool.
Additional prevention strategies were outlined by
Kewalramani and Kraus 20 years ago.18These ideas
included softening the bottom of swimming pools,
muscle strengthening exercises to reduce susceptibility
to injury and training in techniques to prevent
aggravation of existing spinal cord damage during
drowning rescue procedures. Reducing the height of
diving boards was also suggested;18however, this
latter strategy may be less e/C128ective than others because
only 1.6% of injuries in the current study and 6.9% of
injuries reported by Green et al22involved the high
diving board.
Several limitations of this study should be noted.
First, because this is a study requiring a phone
interview several years after the injury occurred, some
bias in the identiﬁcation of the target population for
future prevention programs might have occurred as a
result of di/C128erential mortality. Persons who were
excluded from the study because they were deceased
were probably more likely to be slightly older, male,
nonwhite, ventilator-dependent, have neurologically
complete injuries, and be injured during the 1970’s
than persons who were included in the study.
However, there is no reason to believe the circum-
stances surrounding the injuries of persons who are
now deceased would be any di/C128erent from those of
persons who were included in the study unless certain
trends have occurred during the past two decades.
Even if a slight bias occurred from di/C128erential
exclusion of older data, it is the newer data that are
most relevant to current and future prevention e/C128orts.
Moreover, the fact that demographic and injury
severity characteristics of persons included in this
study are consistent with those of previous studies
suggests that any bias involving these characteristics
should be relatively small.1 3–1 6
To the extent that alcohol and illicit drug use at the
time of the injury is related to subsequent use, the
e/C128ect of these items on the occurrence of SCI in
swimming pool mishaps might be slightly under-
estimated by the exclusion of deceased persons. Also,Swimming pool-related SCI

if certain injury circumstances typically produce more
severe injuries, then the frequency of those circum-
stances might be underestimated.
There is no reason to believe the persons who could
not be located who were still alive would answer the
questions di/C128erently than persons who were success-
fully contacted. There were very few refusals among
persons actually contacted.
The high number of unknowns for certain demo-
graphic characteristics occurred because one of the
data sets in the NSCISC database does not contain
those items. The high number of unknowns for
associated injuries occurred because those items were
not added to the database until 1986. It is not
anticipated that any bias is caused by these unknown
responses.
The validity of self-reported alcohol and drug
involvement might also be questioned. In this study,
blood alcohol data were available in the medical
records of only 10 persons. All 10 tested positive and
all 10 independently admitted that alcohol was inolved
in their injury. A notation in the medical record that
alcohol was suspected but the test was not done
occurred in an additional 27 instances. Again, all 27 of
these persons independently reported that alcohol was
involved in their injury. There was no evidence in the
medical records that anyone who said that alcohol was
not involved was not truthful. Therefore, in this study,
the self-reported use of alcohol at the time of injury
appears to be a valid measure of actual alcohol use.
Since this was one of the more sensitive questions
asked during the interview, it would appear that
responses to other questions should also be valid,
although the possibility of bias resulting from selective
recall of persons being interviewed cannot be totally
excluded, particularly when the injury occurred many
years ago.
This study was not designed to estimate either the
incidence of SCI occurring in swimming pools or
whether any trends have occurred in the frequency of
these injuries over time. However, several population-
based studies suggest that the overall incidence of SCI
in the United States is approximately 10,000 new cases
per year.2 6–2 8If the NSCISC database is representa-
tive of these injuries with respect to their causes, then
it can be estimated that approximately 850 new spinal
cord injuries occur each year as a result of a diving
mishap.1Results of this study suggest that approxi-
mately 300 of those injuries will occur in swimming
pools. This ﬁgure does not include persons who drown
in swimming pools as a result of sustaining a SCI.
Increased frequencies of SCI for certain demo-
graphic groups should not be interpreted to mean that
those persons are at higher risk for obtaining these
injuries. To make such inferences, one must have
information about the degree of exposure to possible
injury (use of swimming pools, number of dives, etc.)
that was not collected in this study.
In addition to the physical, social, and emotional
consequences of SCI resulting from diving mishaps,the economic sequences of these injuries are stagger-
ing. In present value 1992 dollars using a 2% discount
rate, it has been estimated that total direct medical
expenses and indirect costs resulting from lost wages
and fringe beneﬁts over the remaining lifetime of a
person with SCI injured at age 25 average $3,396,669
for persons with injury levels at C4 or above, and
$2,320,824 for persons with injury levels between C5
and C8.29These are the injury levels associated with
diving mishaps. Therefore, it would appear that
primary prevention programs can be highly cost-
e/C128ective if just a single SCI can be prevented. This
study has provided the necessary information to
initiate such programs.
