Swimming is a sport that requires considerable training commitment to reach individual performance goals. 
Nutrition requirements are specific to the macrocycle, microcycle, and individual session. Swimmers should ensure suitable energy availability to support training while maintaining long term health. Carbohydrate intake, both over the day and in relation to a workout, should be manipulated (3–10g/kg of body mass/day) according to the fuel demands of training and the varying importance of undertaking these sessions with high carbohydrate availability. Swimmers should aim to consume 0.3g of high-biological-value protein per kilogram of body mass immediately after key sessions and at regular intervals throughout the day to promote tissue adaptation. A mixed diet consisting of a variety of nutrient-dense food choices should be sufficient to meet the micronutrient requirements of most swimmers. Specific dietary supplements may prove beneficial to swimmers in unique situations, but should be tried only with the support of trained professionals. All swim-mers, particularly adolescent and youth swimmers, are encouraged to focus on a well-planned diet to maximize training performance, which ensures sufficient energy availability especially during periods of growth and development. Swimmers are encouraged to avoid rapid weight fluctuations; rather, optimal body composi-tion should be achieved over longer periods by modest dietary modifications that improve their food choices. During periods of reduced energy expenditure (taper, injury, off season) swimmers are encouraged to match energy intake to requirement. Swimmers undertaking demanding competition programs should ensure suitable recovery practices are used to maintain adequate glycogen stores over the entirety of the competition period.

Swimming is a foundation Olympic sport included 
at every Summer Games since 1896. Competitive races 
are held for the four swimming strokes (freestyle, backstroke, butterfly, breaststroke), individually or in combination (medley). With events lasting from 20 s to 16 min (50 m–1500 m), swimming is a highly technical sport demanding power and endurance underpinned by different combinations of anaerobic and aerobic fuel systems. Relays add the dimension of a team sport to the competition format. Race programs vary from a single day of competition to multiday meets in which swimmers often compete in multiple events of varying distance and stroke over a number of heats, semifinals, and finals.
Swimmers traditionally learn to swim at an early age 
and transition into formal training soon afterward. It is not uncommon for large training volumes to be under -
taken by young swimmers to ensure that they develop optimal biomechanical technique, physiological capac-ity and race skills to allow them to compete at the elite level by adolescence. Indeed, it is possible for swimmers (particularly female swimmers) to achieve high levels of success before full pubertal development. Combinations of advanced training techniques, competition opportuni-ties, and greater commercial rewards have extended the lifespan of a swimmer, and some elite swimmers now compete into their early 30s.
The physiological and biomechanical principles 
underpinning the movement of swimming have been reviewed elsewhere (Pyne & Sharp, 2014), as have the principles of the training required to prepare an athlete to compete in aquatic sports (Mujika et al., 2014). The aim of the current review is to specifically investigate the training and competition characteristics of pool swimming and to discuss nutritional strategies that are important in optimizing the outcomes of each component.
An Overview of the Periodized 
Training and Competition Calendar
Until recently, large training volumes were the hallmark of the preparation of swimmers (Mujika et al., 2014). Indeed, Stewart and Hopkins (2000) observed that a large portion of the training of age group swimmers was completed at low intensities in a nonspecialty stroke (i.e., freestyle), simply for the purpose of making up volume. Traditionally, such training was undertaken for large portions of the year, punctuated by an annual program of large national and international competitions. Prepara-www.IJSNEM-Journal.com

tion for these events included a significant taper period 
followed by short periods of often significant detraining before the program commenced again. A greater discus-sion of the limitations of this periodization model is provided by Mujika et al. (2014).
The increased frequency of domestic and inter -
national competition opportunities for contemporary swimmers has contributed to an evolution in training philosophy, with the volumes and intensities of train -
ing now more accurately reflecting the physiological demands of competition performance. There is also a more marked periodization of the annual swimming program, with training focused on achieving high-level competition performances at regular points throughout the year. Training cycles vary between periods of moder -
ate-high volume with the focus on low-moderate intensity workouts and a smaller proportion of workouts done at very high-intensities, to periods during which there is a larger focus on high-intensity work. These may include blocks of specialized training (e.g., altitude training) or shorter domestic/international competitions (e.g., FINA World Cups). Before major competitions, there is a more pronounced taper, with a reduction in training volume but maintenance of training at high intensities and race pace. For further reviews on the periodization of these macrocycles and the nutritional adjustments, see Mujika et al. (2014) and Burke and Shaw (2013).
The weekly training program of an elite swimmer 
typically involves 1–3 sessions per day and includes a range of different types of pool sessions, supplemented by “dry-land” activities such as yoga, core training, resis -
tance training and cross-training. Examples of the training schedules for different parts of the training calendar are summarized in Table 1a (a summary of different types of training and nutritional strategies included in a swimmer’s program), Table 1b (an illustration of an example train-ing week during a high-volume, low/moderate-intensity phase) and Table 1c (illustration of an example training week during a moderate-volume, high-intensity phase). The nutritional support for such training, which will be

covered over this review, includes a periodization to 
include the needs of each session, recovery and adapta-tion between sessions, and adjustments to suit the larger goals of a training block. This will mean adjustment of total energy and carbohydrate intake according to general fuel needs and goals of physique manipulation, as well as specific arrangement of carbohydrate, fluid and protein intake around sessions to optimize training performance and/or adaptation.
Energy Requirements=
The changing energy needs of a swimmer chiefly reflect his or her training/racing volume, growth or goals to alter physique, and, in the case of nonelite competitors, other lifestyle activities. Typical values for the self-reported energy intakes of male and female swimmers are 15–20 MJ/day (3600–4800 Kcal/day) and 8–11 MJ/day (1900–2600 Kcal/day), respectively. The dietary survey literature on swimmers, summarized in Table 2, includes examples in which training blocks are com-pleted in apparent energy balance (Alméras et al., 1997; Ousley-Pahnke et al., 2001; Vallieres, 1989). However, other studies report apparent large mismatches between energy intake and energy expenditure (up to 10 MJ/day or 2,400 kcal/day) when training volumes and intensities are extreme (Trappe et al., 1997).
There appears to be a sex-difference in the ability 
to match energy needs to expenditure during different swimming volumes (Berning et al., 1991; Kabasakalis et al., 2007; Noland et al., 2001). Male swimmers can appropriately increase their energy intake during periods of increased training, mainly by increasing their car -
bohydrate consumption to match increased fuel needs (Barr & Costill, 1992), although this is not always the case (Costill et al., 1988). Conversely, female swimmers have been reported to be less capable of spontaneously making such adjustments. Female collegiate swimmers who were tracked over an entire season were unable to adjust energy intake according to fluctuations in training Table 1b  Example of High-Volume, Low- to Moderate-Intensity Training Week

volume, with a noticeable gain in body fat during the 
off-season (Alméras et al., 1997). Indeed, the estimated energy cost of this body composition change was similar to the notional energy expenditure of the missed training sessions. However, within swimming circles, there is also discussion that female swimmers appear to be able to undertake training volumes similar to those of male swimmers but with unexpectedly lower energy intakes.
The appearance of “energy efficiency” in female 
swimmers who report energy intakes that are less than expected or less than their male counterparts while undertaking training with stable body composition has often been questioned. Explanations for this phenomenon include lower levels of lean muscle mass (Jones & Leitch, 1993; Van Handel et al., 1984), enhanced efficiency of swimming (Costill et al., 1985; Zamparo et al., 2011), and underreporting of dietary intake, particularly related to concerns about body composition. Athletes in other weight-conscious sports are often described as under -
reporting their dietary intakes on self-reported food diaries (Jonnalagadda et al., 2000). A significant negative energy balance is of concern when it affects health and performance.
Low energy availability, defined as an energy intake 
that is too low to support the body’s energy needs for optimal function once the energy cost of exercise is subtracted, is known to have a large number of negative health consequences. These include reductions in meta-Table 1c   Example of Moderate-Volume, Moderate- to High-Intensity Training Week

bolic rate, hormonal disturbances, menstrual dysfunction, 
suboptimal bone health, and an increased risk of illness and injury (Burke, 2014; Melin et al., 2014). Recently, a study highlighted the impact of a low energy availability specifically on swimmers (VanHeest et al., 2014). Elite junior female swimmers were monitored over 12 weeks of training that included a period of increased volume,  and a subgroup of swimmers who had regular menstrual function was compared with another subgroup in which ovarian suppression of their cycles occurred. This sub-group had higher body fat levels than their counterparts and maintained a stable weight over the course of the study, despite reporting a lower energy intake, while completing the same training as the regularly menstruat-ing group. Energy deficiency was confirmed among these swimmers via measurements of resting energy expendi-ture (depressed) and triiodothyronine and insulin-like growth factor concentrations (dropped over the course of the study). Consequently, the two groups of swim-mers were matched for performance (400-m swim time) at the commencement of the study; however, after 12 weeks of training, only the healthy group experienced an improvement (8% increase in speed); the energy-deprived swimmers showed a 10% decline in swimming speed.
Therefore, a major focus of a swimmer’s diet should 
be the manipulation of energy intake to meet daily train-ing requirements. This should be achieved through the manipulation of macronutrients according to the intensity, frequency, and volume of sessions (see Tables 1b and 1c). Swimmers should be educated on practical nutrition skills that allow them to easily transition between low to potentially high energy intakes. A strategy that assists with energy matching as well as providing direct nutri-tion support for workouts is to organize nutrient intake before, during, and after the training session. However, the regulation of appetite also plays a critical role in the success of such strategies.
Swimming has been associated anecdotally with an 
increased appetite and risk of overeating compared with other sports activities; the potential mechanism involves reduced thermoregulatory stress because of dissipation of heat into the cool water environment. Indeed, 1 hr of running undertaken in cold conditions (10 °C) has been shown to increase ad libitum food intake and reduce satiety compared with exercise in temperate (20 °C) environmental conditions. Conversely, the same bout of exercise in the heat (30 °C) reduced feelings of hunger and prospective food consumption (Wasse et al., 2014). Lambert et al. (1990) failed to find a difference in appetite and ad libitum intake after bouts of swimming and run-ning matched for energy expenditure and intensity (≤70% VO2max); the pool temperature during the swimming session was 29 °C. Other studies of cool water (20 °C) exercise have found a 40% increase in postexercise energy intake compared with exercise in thermoneutral or control situations (White et al., 2005). Whether the mechanism for an increased food intake after exercise in water is associated with core temperature regulation or some other mechanism remains unknown, and more research is needed. However, it is logical to recommend that swimmers undertaking low-intensity training sessions, even in pools with controlled temperatures, require sig-nificant education regarding dietary strategies to control energy intake at times when appetite may be artificially amplified. Conversely, they should endeavor to use foods that are appetizing and easier to consume in situations in which appetite is suppressed (e.g., after completing high-intensity sessions in hot pools/environments).Table 2 (continued)

Carbohydrate Requirements
Swimming training can significantly deplete muscle 
glycogen stores (Costill et al., 1988b); the completion of high-volume training blocks is reliant on the consumption of adequate carbohydrates (Costill et al., 1988a). The classic study by Costill et al. (1988a) demonstrated that swimmers who failed to increase carbohydrate intake in response to a sudden increase in training volume reported greater fatigue, muscle soreness, and inability to complete designated workouts compared with counterparts who spontaneously increased their carbohydrate intake (8.2 vs. 5.3 g/kg of body mass, or BM, per day) to maintain muscle glycogen stores. Even a minor degree of subopti-mal refueling may interfere with performance: A group of well-trained swimmers who reduced daily carbohydrate intake by 10% over 3 days reported a reduction in perfor -
mance over a distance of 400 yards (365 m). Conversely, a similar increase (10%) in dietary carbohydrate led to performance enhancement over 100- and 400-yard (91.5 and 365 m) swimming time trials (Reilly & Woodbridge, 1999). This does not suggest that the training diet should be high in carbohydrate per se. Rather, when high quality/intensity training is required, carbohydrate intakes should allow muscle glycogen restoration (“high carbohydrate availability”). Indeed, another study of swimmers under -
taking a moderate training load found that a carbohydrate intake of 6 g/kg of BM/day met requirements for glyco-gen restoration and that no performance advantage was gained by consuming a greater amount (12 g/kg of BM/day; Lamb et al., 1990).
Daily carbohydrate intake should be periodized to 
match the changing fuel requirements of the training pro-gram to permit training at high intensities. Tables 1A, 1B, and 1C illustrate the carbohydrate-dependent workouts and how total carbohydrate could be periodized over the week and within a day to ensure high carbohydrate availability for key sessions. Other sessions may tolerate lower carbohydrate availability, which will be inevitable when several sessions are undertaken in close succession during high-volume training weeks. In fact, some sessions might be deliberately undertaken with low carbohydrate availability (low muscle glycogen stores and/or overnight fasting) to expose the muscle to a higher training stimulus and, therefore, to promote a greater metabolic adaptation. For a detailed review of such practices in swimming, see Mujika et al. (2014). Such interventions should be carefully programmed into a swimmer’s yearly training plan to ensure low carbohydrate availability is used at appropriate times and does not compromise the outcome of strength and power blocks or immune health.
Carbohydrate intake can be increased in the total 
diet by including carbohydrate-rich foods at meals and snacks and by consuming carbohydrate sources before and during workouts and in the recovery afterward (Burke et al., 2014). There has been little specific investigation of the effect on immediate and cumulative performance of consuming carbohydrates before and during a swimming session. In fact, in the only directly applicable research, swimmers consuming carbohydrates (1g/kg BM) during a training session failed to achieve a significant benefit to their performance of a set of 10 × 100 yd (91.5 m) sprints completed at the end of a standardized training session (O’Sullivan et al., 1994). However, the general sports nutrition literature supports the value of consuming carbohydrates during prolonged exercise (> 90 min) to promote performance by providing an additional muscle fuel source (Burke et al., 2011). Of particular interest to shorter and/or technical sessions is the recent evidence of enhanced central drive and improved pacing strategies arising from carbohydrate intake; more specifically, there is evidence for contact of carbohydrate with receptors in the oral cavity (Jeukendrup, 2013), even during sprint exercise (Beaven et al., 2013). Specifically, the frequent exposure of the mouth to small amounts of carbohydrates during non–carbohydrate-dependent exercise bouts (< 60 min) enhances reward center functioning in the brain and consistently enhances performance (Jeukendrup, 2013). This phenomenon is discussed in more detail in the review of race practices for open-water swimming (Shaw, 2014) but could also be of use in a training scenario. It should be noted that the intake of carbohydrates before and during a swimming workout changes the relationship of lactate to swim velocity to indicate a greater contribu-tion of anaerobic carbohydrate utilization for fuel use. For example, in a group of well-trained swimmers, the ingestion of 12 ml/kg BM of a 6% sucrose/glucose sport drink before undertaking a graded exercise capacity test in the pool resulted in significantly higher concentrations of blood lactate during the early stages of this test (35–50% at step 2) compared with a placebo trial (Millard-Stafford et al., 2010). This observation is important to understand because this relationship is traditionally monitored over a training cycle as a sign of the adaptive response; a lower lactate level for a given swimming speed is considered to indicate a positive training effect. This does not under -
mine the general relationship between fast swimming performances in competition and high levels of lactate production but shows the limitations of using lactate monitoring without dietary control as an indicator of training performance and prescription (Millard-Stafford et al., 2010; Reilly & Woodbridge, 1999). 
Finally, high-intensity exercise has been shown to 
reduce the effectiveness of the body’s immune defenses, particularly after exercise, when blood concentrations of glucose are low and cortisol is increased (Pyne et al., 2014). This review suggests that the consumption of carbohydrates during prolonged and/or high-intensity exercise may attenuate the reduction in immune system activity and reduce the risk of illness. Therefore, swim-mers are encouraged to consume carbohydrate-containing foods and drinks, either immediately before or in small frequent amounts during key performance workouts, to optimize long-term training adaptations (see Tables 1B and 1C). Strategies to enhance refueling after glycogen-depleting workouts are discussed in more detail by Burke et al. (2014); there is also a discussion of tactics to enhance glycogen synthesis when the interval between 
nutrition for s wimming  367
carbohydrate-dependent workouts is short (< 8 hr) and/
or total energy intake needs to be monitored (i.e., when loss of body fat is desired).
Protein Requirements
Protein intake is an important consideration in the achievement of optimal training adaptations. Dietary surveys of swimmers typically report intakes of more than 1.2–1.6 g/kg BM/day (Burke, 2007), which meets the suggested increase in daily protein requirements associated with sport. However, the current research focus concerns recommendations for the optimal timing, type, and amount of protein to promote adaptation and recovery from the specific stimulus of each exercise bout (Burke et al., 2014). Swimming is a challenging sport because the periodized training program includes endurance exercise, intermittent high-intensity sprints, and resistance training (Tables 1B and 1C). It has been suggested that the undertaking of mixed training stimuli in close proximity, as often occurs in the swimmer’s training program (e.g., a pool session undertaken before or after a resistance workout) could produce interference with the net training stimulus. Nevertheless, a study of elite female swimmers who undertook a combination of an interval training session and a resistance workout found an effective increase in muscle protein synthesis (Tipton et al., 1996). Therefore, to maximize the early protein synthetic response to the exercise stimulus, swim-mers should follow the current guidelines to consume 0.3g/kg BM of protein (~20–25 g of high-quality protein) soon after a key workout, resistance exercise sessions, or a race (Moore et al., 2009; Witard et al., 2014). They should continue to consume similar amounts of protein at 4–5 opportunities, including meals and snacks spread over the day and before bed, when trying to maximize the training response and/or increase muscle mass (Areta et al., 2013). Strategies are covered in more detail by Burke et al. (2014).
Micronutrient Requirements
A moderate to high energy intake and a wide variety of nutrient-rich foods generally guarantees a generous supply of micronutrients and phytochemicals. Because male swimmers are regularly reported to have high energy intake (Table 2), they are typically not considered to be a group at risk for low micronutrients. Reports of suboptimal micronutrient status are generally limited to female swimmers and concern iron (Farajian et al., 2004; Kabasakalis et al., 2007; Vallieres, 1989; Van Handel et al., 1984) and calcium (Farajian et al., 2004; Paschoal & Amancio, 2004). These findings are typically asso-ciated with restrained eating practices and inadequate food variety. In fact, in one study of female swimmers (Petersen et al., 2006), an improvement in iron status over a training season was associated with an improvement in the quality and quantity of dietary choices. This suggests that through the quality of food choices and by ensuring appropriate energy availability, good micronutrient status can be achieved.
Vitamin D is a micronutrient in the current spotlight 
because of its importance to health and performance and the risk of inadequate status in people who do not have adequate exposure to sunshine. Vitamin D insufficiency may be an issue for swimmers who train indoors or in environments in which exposure to ultraviolet B radia-tion is minimal. Indeed, one third of a group of Israeli swimmers who trained indoors were found to have 25(OH) vitamin D levels below 30 ng/ml (75 nmol/L), a level considered to be insufficient for optimal health and performance (Constantini et al., 2010). Likewise, swim-mers were among a group of indoor-training American college athletes who were found to have significantly lower vitamin D levels than athletes who trained outdoors (Halliday et al., 2011). Recently, the supplementation of 4,000 IU (100 mg) of vitamin D in National Collegiate Athletic Association swimmers and divers who were at risk (living above 38° north latitude), but not deficient, was effective in maintaining (+1 ng/ml) plasma 25(OH) vitamin D over a winter training season. Those receiv-ing a placebo saw a nonsignificant drop of 20 ng/ml (50 nmol/L; Lewis et al., 2013). Therefore swimmers who fall into the high-risk groups for insufficient sunshine exposure are encouraged to monitor their vitamin D status and to seek appropriate interventions, including supplementation, to enhance stores if they are found to be insufficient (Powers et al., 2011).
Physique and Performance  
in Swimming
Swimming performance is based on the ability to gener -
ate forward propulsion while minimizing drag through the water and is aided by a fine balance between muscle mass and appropriate morphology (e.g., surface area and body fat; Sharp et al., 2014). Typically, sprinters and high-level swimmers are taller and heavier than long-distance or less successful swimmers; female long-distance swimmers traditionally have significantly higher skinfold thicknesses than all other swimmers (Carter & Ackland, 1994). Ideally, training should be associated with periodized increases in lean tissue and reductions in fat mass across the swimming season (Alméras et al., 1997; Anderson et al., 2006; Petersen et al., 2006; Pyne et al., 2006), taking into account the physique changes associated with puberty, particularly in girls. Specific information on the ideal physique for swimming or the effect of body composition on swimming performance is limited and hard to interpret. For a period at least, the importance of physique was skewed by the mitigating effects of bodysuits on drag. The recent banning of these suits is likely to have increased the interest in manipulat-ing the body composition of swimmers.
Although it would be valuable to undertake cross-
sectional and longitudinal studies of performance and 
368  shaw et al.
physique in swimming, the limitations of such data in 
determining cause and effect must be acknowledged. For example, in the case of observations of the extreme leanness of certain elite swimmers or improvements in performance associated with physique changes, it is hard to distinguish between the effects of body fat or lean mass on performance, per se, and the influence of the training or dietary commitment that were involved in the achievement of such a physique. It is most likely that ideal physique is individual to each swimmer (influenced by developmental age, chosen stroke, and competition distance) and that each swimmer has a range of desirable physical characteristics within which they maintain good health while training and performing well. The swimmer should aim to achieve their optimal body composition over a number of years as well as periodize it over the season.
Gain of body fat, whether as a natural consequence 
of adolescence or during the off-season, is a consistent concern for many female swimmers and their coaches. Clearly, an excessive amount or rate of increase of body fat is detrimental to performance, presumably because of the sudden change in the fluid dynamics and biomechan-ics of swimming. There is both research and anecdotal evidence of a worrying prevalence of weight-control phobias among female swimmers, accompanied by disordered eating or pathogenic weight loss behaviors (Benson, 1991). It is now recognized that a risk factor for the development of disordered eating among ath-letes is the necessity to wear figure-revealing or skimpy sports clothing (Otis et al., 1997). The constant display of a changing body shape is likely to be a particularly stressful activity for the adolescent female swimmer with self-esteem and body-image problems. Clearly, a complex array of factors contributes to the pressure felt by many female swimmers with regard to weight and body fat levels. Although not as prominent in the literature, male athletes in some sports may also be susceptible to body-image pressures. The consequences of strategies used to achieve sporting norms can have similar significant negative performance and health consequences as female athletes (Hagmar et al., 2013). Coaches and support per -
sonnel should be aware of their role and responsibilities around the appropriate discussion of body composition with swimmers. These populations should be targeted for sound professional advice regarding the setting and achievement of long-term goals for ideal physique. The problem of disordered eating and eating disorders within aquatic sports is covered in more detail by Melin et al. (2014).
Nutrition for Racing
Nutrition for racing encompasses two major themes: addressing the nutrition-related factors that underpin fatigue in the swimmers’ specific event or competition schedule, as well as managing the practical issues associ-ated with the competition lifestyle and environment. The latter challenges are discussed in more detail in the review by Stellingwerff et al. (2014) and are often encountered during the reduced energy expenditure associated with the pronounced training taper before major events and the racing commitment itself. To circumvent a gain of substantial amounts of body fat, swimmers should be aware of their changing nutrient and energy needs and undertake mindful eating within the competition environ-ment (Stellingwerff et al., 2014).
Although there are different event formats, swim-
ming competitions typically involve a multiday meet; the Fédération Internationale de Natation (FINA) World championships and Olympic Games program extend to 8 days, with heats conducted in the morning session and semifinals and finals in the evening. The variability in competition load between swimmers can be significant. Elite breaststrokers, for example, rarely swim other strokes and may compete in only a single event at a major championship. Conversely, talented swimmers can undertake a substantial race program that involves several races within single-session and multiple events across different strokes in both heats and finals sessions over a period of 8 days. Single-event swimmers are unlikely to challenge their fuel stores, but multievent swimmers face significant barriers to timely fuel maintenance and postrace recovery. A well planned approach is required, using the principles reviewed by Burke et al. (2014) to organize a schedule of meals and postrace snacks to achieve race preparation and recovery goals.
Large multievent programs undertaken over consecu-
tive days require a planned approach to race eating, espe-cially when the athlete is competing in events away from his or her home base. A competition-day nutrition plan should include a familiar and well-tolerated carbohydrate-rich prerace meal, consumed 1–3 hr before warm-up. During and after warm-ups, and in recovery between events on the same program, carbohydrate-containing drinks (e.g., sport drinks) and light carbohydrate foods (fruit, cereal bars, sport bars) will help to maintain body carbohydrate supplies and fluid balance and prevent hunger. Carbohydrate- and protein-rich food and formu-lated sport food choices such as liquid meal supplements, flavored and unflavored milk, or meat sandwiches are useful at the end of competition sessions to promote repair and adaptation, and when carbohydrate intake is suboptimal, to promote glycogen resynthesis (Burke et al., 2014). For swimmers competing in whole-day meets, intake should be targeted to the amount of time between races. When the time between races is less than 60 min, swimmers should focus on carbohydrate sources that are unlikely to cause gastrointestinal upset. As the time between races increases, more substantial meals, includ-ing protein and other nutrients, can be consumed to aid recovery and improve overall race-day food quality.
Swimmers should plan for all eventualities and carry 
suitable food choices with them to the pool for periods of reduced food access. Swimmers should pay particular attention to the use of supplements or foods containing caffeine. Although little evidence exists to link one poor 
nutrition for s wimming  369
night of sleep to reduced performance on the subsequent 
day, the frequent use of caffeine over a multiple-day competition can lead to accumulated sleep loss, which may reduce performance toward the end of the meet, or to a cyclical misuse of sleeping aids followed by more caffeine intake.
Supplements and Sports Foods
Swimmers are regularly reported as enthusiastic supple-ment consumers. Data collected at doping control at the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games reported swimming among the sports with the greatest prevalence of supple-ment use (Corrigan & Kazlauskas, 2003). Baylis et al. (2001) looked specifically at the supplement practices of high-level swimmers and reported that 99% of swim-mers used dietary supplements (including formulated sports foods); 94% used at least one non–food-based dietary supplement, and one swimmer reported using 27 different products. The current authors (Shaw, 2013) have measured supplement practices in a similar group of elite Australian swimmers (2009 World championship participants), noting a continued high prevalence of use (97%). However, the influence of a more expansive and visible supplement industry was seen in this 2009 group, with a greater number of supplements (9.2 ± 3.7 vs 5.9 ± 2.9) from a greater number of individual manufactur -
ers (7.6 ± 2.9 vs 5.6 ± 2.7). Swimmers in 2009 focused their practices on supplements with sound evidence of performance enhancing effects (such as caffeine, sodium bicarbonate and sports foods; Shaw, 2013).
The general issues involved with the use of supple-
ments and sports foods are discussed by Maughan et al. (2014). Even when there is evidence for the use of such products, the swimmer is advised to be aware of the appropriate situations and protocols of use and to take into account the “cost” of products in terms of financial outlay and the small but real risk of an inadvertent doping outcome (Maughan et al., 2014). To avoid adverse out-comes of supplement use, swimmers are encouraged to practice dietary-supplement protocols in multiple situa-tions before major competition use.
The Adolescent Swimmer
Swimming training and competition can start at a young age; many young swimmers complete large training volumes by their early teens. Parents and coaches of these swimmers need to be aware of the unique nutrition requirements of this group. Increased energy needs of growth and development should be accounted for by an increased intake of a variety of food sources. Because of their training immaturity and lower level of metabolic adaptations, carbohydrate requirements for a given workout may be relatively higher. From Current sentence to Protein requirements (grams per kilogram of BM) of adolescent swimmers are likely to be increased because of growth. These requirements can be suitably met by choosing a variety of protein containing foods, as part of a high energy intake. It is unknown whether adoles-cent swimmers have higher than normal micronutrient requirements. However, they are encouraged to choose a wide variety of foods within a diet that meets their energy needs to ensure micronutrient intakes are suitable. Parents and coaches can support adolescent swimmers by establishing good meal patterns at home, reinforcing the education pathway described in the section below in the home environment, and ensuring the availability of appropriate and convenient whole-food options around the workouts.
Nutrition Knowledge  
and Practices in Swimmers
The ability to follow the practices outlined in this review requires significant nutrition knowledge and food literacy. Although athletes typically have similar general nutrition knowledge, and greater sports nutrition knowledge than their nonathletic peers (Heaney et al., 2011), swimmers are often reported to consume diets that are suboptimal (Farajian et al., 2004; Kabasakalis et al., 2007; Petersen et al., 2006). Furthermore, the experience of the current authors is that it takes a carefully designed education pro-gram to progressively develop nutrition knowledge and practice across a swimmer’s career. Nutrition education should focus on nutrition for health at a learn-to-swim level and then progress to the manipulation of specific nutrients for adaptation and performance goals. Sports nutrition concepts should be introduced with a focus on whole foods consumed for performance purposes, evolving as the swimmers become more elite into educa -
tion around single nutrients or use of supplements and specialized sports foods. “Hands on” education of skills such as meal planning, shopping, and food preparation are paramount to a swimmer’s ability to turn knowledge into practice. Without these skills and food literacy, swimmers are ill-equipped to achieve the complex dietary strategies and nutrient periodization promoted in reviews such as this.
Summary
Like the other aquatic sports, swimming provides con-siderable nutritional challenges in both training and competition phases. Energy and carbohydrate needs can vary greatly between swimmers and across the various components of a week, macrocycle, annual program, or swimming career. To achieve the best outcomes, swim-mers need to learn the skills to vary their food intake accordingly, especially to periodise optimal nutritional support before, during, and after workouts. The achieve-ment of ideal physique can be challenging, particularly for female swimmers. Competition nutrition requires a special eating plan to promote recovery between races, especially for swimmers who race in multiple events. 
370  shaw et al.
Some supplements and sports foods can be used by swim-
mers to achieve their nutritional goals and optimal perfor -
mance. Many of the recommendations for swimmers are based on evidence gained from research on other sports with similar characteristics. More swimming-centered studies are needed to provide specific support for these guidelines or to evolve new practices.
