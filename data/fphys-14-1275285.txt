Background: During the repetitive execution of the swimming strokes, the
muscles responsible for the internal rotations of the shoulders tend to becomestronger compared to the muscles that oppose these movements. The aim of thisstudy was to analyse the effect of a strengthening program for the shoulder rotatormuscles using elastic band exercises in a diagonal Kabat pattern (D2 for ﬂexion) in
swimmers, to develop an effective, quick and easy-to-implement protocol for
preventive training routines.
Methods: A randomized controlled trial design was carried out. Internal and
external rotation range of movement, isometric strength of the musclesresponsible for internal and external rotation of the shoulder, scapular
movements, was measured at the beginning of the study and after 8 weeks
post-intervention. A total of 22 male swimmers participated in the study andwere randomly assigned to either an experimental group ( n= 11) or a control
group ( n= 11). The experimental group underwent a 8-week shoulder-strength
program using elastic bands, while the control group focused on aquatic training.
Results: The strength-training program resulted in an improvement in the
isometric strength of the muscles responsible for external rotation and a betterbalance between the shoulder rotator muscles in the experimentalgroup. However, these improvements have not been signi ﬁcant ( p>0.05).
Conclusion: The strengthening exercise program showed minimal improvement
in shoulder rotation strength and range of motion. These ﬁndings suggest that the
prescribed shoulder-strengthening exercise could be a quick-bene ﬁcial dry-land
training option to improve external rotation shoulder strength or range of motion,but more studies with larger sample sizes and more weeks of treatment areneeded to determine the ef ﬁcacy of this protocol.

1 Introduction
Swimming is a cyclical sport with high technical demands,
training loads and strength requirements to overcome an externalload on the upper body ( Jürimäe et al., 2007 ). The leverage effect of
the upper limbs in the water can lead to joint and muscle overload
and even injury ( Hill et al., 2015 ). The rotator cuff in particular plays
an important role in this process, as it is involved in stabilizing theshoulder against the addiction and internal rotation movementsrequired to propel the swimmer through the water ( Batalha et al.,
2015 ). However, during the training season, overuse of the internal
rotators and shoulder adductors can lead to a strength imbalance inswimmers, as the internal rotators gain much more strengthcompared to the external rotators and shoulder abductors,
weakening the latter by the end of the season ( Trinidad et al.,
2021 ). This reason, an imbalance between these antagonistic muscle
groups can lead to rotator cuff injuries known as “swimmer ’s
shoulder ”(Batalha et al., 2015 ;Kluemper et al., 2016 ). As a
preventive measure, strength and stretching exercises have beenincorporated into training in various sports disciplines to improvethe performance of athletes ( Asker et al., 2018 ). It would thus be
advisable to develop protocols to prevent shoulder injuries caused by
these muscular imbalances by strengthening the muscles responsible
for external rotation and abduction of the shoulder ( Marek et al.,
2014 ).
In terms of etiology, prevalence and incidence, the shoulder is
the joint with the greatest range of motion in the whole body, so theincidence of injury is very high ( Tooth et al., 2020 ). In so-called
“overhead athletes, ”which include swimmers, injuries to this joint
complex have a high prevalence ( Gaunt and Mafulli, 2012 ;
Wanivenhaus et al., 2012 ). However, the incidence of shoulder
pain in swimmers is around 38%, with between 29% and 91% ofswimmers having experienced this symptom during their sportingcareer ( Bak, 2010 ). This could be explained by the fact that in water,
propulsion is based on the upper limbs, in contrast to land sportswhere the lower limbs are predominantly used ( Sein et al., 2010 ). In
addition, overuse of the shoulder muscles during weekly trainingsessions, which can be as many as 6 or 7 per week, leads to muscle
imbalances between the rotators which, if not treated or prevented,
can lead to injury later ( Tessaro et al., 2017 ). Furthermore, in terms
of therapeutic treatment, the most commonly used techniques toincrease rotator cuff strength and muscular balance in overheadathletes include scapular-humeral stabilisation exercises,plyometrics, maximal strength exercises and the use ofelectrotherapy ( Feijen et al., 2020 ). However, in recent years
some studies have been published demonstrating the ef ﬁcacy of
strength exercises with elastic bands following a PNF-type diagonal
Kabat pattern ( Page et al., 1993 ;Richards and Dawson, 2009 ),
showing positive effects on the improvement of rotator cuffstrength ( Moeller et al., 2014 ) after combining compensatory
training with elastic bands with the diagonal Kabat pattern.However, most of these studies analysed sports with similarbiomechanics to swimmers, such as handball, volleyball andbaseball ( Swanik et al., 2002 ).
In relation to elastic band training, scienti ﬁc evidence has
demonstrated the effectiveness of Kabat diagonal training usingelastic bands following a progressive strength training protocol(Page et al., 1993 ). The elastic bands used in the current studiesare characterised by different resistances, indicated by different
colours, and are thought to provide greater electromyographicactivation of the scapular musculature compared to free weighttraining ( Witt et al., 2011 ). The protocol proposed by Manske et al.
(Manske et al., 2015 ) shows the progression of the resistance of the
elastic band as a function of the subject ’s perceived exertion (RPE)
after performing the training tasks, using a numerical scale from 0 to
10 (Wong-Baker scale): if the RPE value was lower than 6, theresistance was increased. During the repetitions, each patient ’s
subjective perception of exertion (RPE) was assessed. If the RPE
was equal to or less than 6, the repetitions were increased to amaximum of 25, then the resistance was increased by changing theelastic band and returning to 15 repetitions ( Manske et al., 2015 ).
But the position of the patient to perform the Kabat diagonals varies
according to the studies, the most common position being seated to
avoid thoracic compensations ( Escamilla et al., 2009 ). As for the
point of ﬁxation of the elastic band, this varies according to the
studies in 3 points: head, feet, and iliac crest. However, there is nosingle consensus in the current literature on protocols applied toswimmers, with most studies focusing on overhead athletes in waterpolo, volleyball, baseball and softball ( Escamilla et al., 2009 ;Witt
et al., 2011 ;Manske et al., 2015 ;Batalha et al., 2018 ;Park and Park,
2019 ).
Therefore, training the external rotators of the shoulder may be a
strategy to prevent rotator cuff injuries in swimmers due to the highincidence of injuries and the biomechanical importance of therotator cuff during the sporting gesture [ Batalha et al., 2015 ;
Costa et al., 2014 ). For this reason, the aim of the study was to
examine the effects of a diagonal Kabat pattern (D2 for ﬂexion) on
the strength of all the movements involving external rotation of the
shoulder, scapular movements, and shoulder range of motion
(ROM). We hypothesized that the experimental group had animprovement in shoulder strength, ROM and scapular movements.
2 Material and methods
2.1 Study design
A prospective, longitudinal, randomised, controlled, single-
blind, 8-week clinical trial was conducted following theCONSORT guidelines and registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov
(No. NCT05884996). Subjects who agreed to take part in thestudy were randomised into two groups using opaque envelopes:Control Group and Intervention Group (shoulder external rotatorcuff strengthening using Kabat diagonal of D2 ﬂexion and
progressive resistance using elastic bands). All pre- and post-
intervention assessments were performed by 2 assessors blindedto the subject ’s group.
2.2 Participants
A total of twenty-two university swimmers were included in this
study. Inclusion criteria were to be between 18 and 33 years old,
male, and to train at least 2 days per week; exclusion criteria were tohave no acute infections or to have any shoulder pathology. On theother hand, subjects who did not sign the informed consent form
Frontiers in Physiology frontiersin.org 02Della Tommasina et al. 10.3389/fphys.2023.1275285
were not included in the study, which was approved by the Research
Ethics Committee of the European University of Madrid (code CIPI/20/007) in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki ( World
Medical Association, 2001 ).
2.3 Instruments
2.3.1 Maximum isometric strength of the external
and internal rotators of the shoulder joint complex
An Active Force 2 dynamometer (San Diego, United States of
America) was used according to the protocol of Hébert et al. (2011) .
Prior to the start of the test, the swimmers were instructed in theentire procedure, given time to familiarise themselves with the
equipment and given 3 min to warm up with 2 test sets at
minimum effort. The unit of measurement of the device was thekilogram (kg).
Subjects were then placed in the s upine decubitus position. The
upper limb to be assessed was placed in shoulder abduction and 90
°
elbow ﬂexion so that the forearm was perpendicular to the ground and
the stretcher. The dynamometer was placed transversely to the distalextremity of the upper limb, in precise contact with the patient ’s wrist.
Two maximal isometric contractions were performed for 5 s, with 30 s
rest between contractions, for th e external and internal rotation
movements. During ex ecution, the blinded physiotherapist
maintained ﬁrm contact with the dynamometer and applied a
parallel resistance equal to the force applied by the athlete, withoutallowing the swimmer ’s upper limb to move. In addition, the athletes
were verbally stimulated to produc e the maximum possible effort and
were instructed not to perform the V alsava manoeuvre during the test.
Finally, the force exerted was digit ally recorded by the apparatus and
only the maximum value achieved was used, as a higher value indicatedgreater muscular effort.
2.3.2 Range of motion in external rotation
A goniometer (Tandou_1AA800252 ®) was used to measure the
swimmers in the supine position on a stretcher, with the armstabilised and a towel placed under the humerus to maintain a
10/15
°arm position anterior to the coronal plane. The athlete ’s arms
were placed at 90°shoulder abduction, the elbow off the stretcher at
90°ﬂexion, and the forearm and wrist at 0°(perpendicular to the
stretcher and ﬂoor). The axis of the goniometer was placed over the
central part of the acromion. The ﬁxed arm of the goniometer was
positioned perpendicular to the ﬂoor, while the movable arm was
superimposed on the ﬁxed arm, aligned with the longitudinal
midline between the ulna and its styloid process.
2.3.3 Muscular balance of the rotator cuff
With the results of the maximum isometric strength assessment,
a ratio was made between the internal and external rotators of eacharm (maximum isometric strength - maximum internal rotation/maximum isometric strength —maximum external rotation); a value
closer to 1 indicates a better muscular balance.
2.3.4 Scapulohumeral coordination using the
PALM
The PALM was used to measure the medial/lateral displacement
of the shoulder blade and its upward rotation during arm raising andat rest. The swimmers were placed in a standing position and the
arms of the PALM ( da Costa et al., 2010 ) were placed corresponding
to the inferior angle of the scapula and the spinous process of theclosest thoracic vertebra. The distance between the two points wasmeasured at rest and at the end of arm elevation. The results werethen compared with the contralateral side.
2.4 Procedure
Elastic bands were used during the test, according to the
protocol described by Batalha et al. ( Batalha et al., 2015 ) with the
aim of increasing the muscle strength of the external rotators andachieving the optimal angle of force application of the external
rotators. Each session with the experimental group lasted
approximately 4 min per subject and took place 2 days per weekduring the 8-week period. The intervention took place before theusual aquatic exercise session. The control group had to follow theirusual routine without repeating the exercises suggested to theexperimental group. The sessions were led by thephysiotherapist-researchers of the study, who were responsiblefor supervising the correct performance of the exercises.
During each repetition, the subjects had to carry the end of the
elastic band following Kabat ’s D2 diagonal pattern for ﬂexion. All
started from a position of adduction, extension and internal rotationof the shoulder with extension and pronation of the elbow, ﬂexion
and ulnar tilt of the wrist, to a position of ﬂexion, abduction and
external rotation of the shoulder with extension and supination ofthe elbow, extension and radial tilt of the wrist. Each subject in theexperimental group began the ﬁrst session by performing 3 sets of
10 repetitions for each upper extremity. Each subject in the
intervention group performed 3 sets of 10 repetitions for eachupper extremity. At the end of each set, each patient ’s subjective
perception of exertion (RPE) was assessed using a visual scale withvalues from 0 to 10, depending on the intensity of the perceivedexertion. If a value of 6 or less was reached on the RPE, 5 repetitionswere added up to a maximum of 20. Once 20 repetitions werereached, the resistance of the elastic band could be increased in the
following session, starting again with 10 repetitions.
2.4.1 Sample size calculation
The sample size calculation was performed using the G*Power
Software version 3.1.9.2, considering an alpha error of 0.05 and astatistical power of 0.8, with a medium effect size (f = 0.33 or Etapartial squared = 0.10) based on the primary outcome (shoulderstrength) and an estimated dropout rate of 10%. Therefore, a total of
22 participants were determined as the required sample size. This
sample was divided into two groups, with each group consisting of11 participants.
2.5 Data analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics
version 29 for Windows (IBM, Armonk, NY, United States). The
distribution of the data was assessed using the Shapiro-Wilk test forsample sizes less than 50, in addition to examining histograms. Forparametric variables ( p>0.05), central tendency and dispersion data
Frontiers in Physiology frontiersin.org 03Della Tommasina et al. 10.3389/fphys.2023.1275285
were presented as mean and standard deviation, while for non-
parametric variables ( p<0.05), median and interquartile range were
reported.
An independent t-test or Mann-Whitney U test was performed
to compare baseline characteristics between the two groups, takinginto account the assumptions of homoscedasticity and sphericity. Ifthe assumptions were met, a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)with a 2 × 2 design was performed. Effect size was assessed usingpartial eta squared ( η2p), with values of 0.01 interpreted as small,
0.06 as medium and 0.14 as large. A 95% con ﬁdence interval was
used for all analyses.
3 Results
A total of 22 participants with a mean age of 25.71 years old, weight
of 75.53 kg, height 177.34 cm and 13.32 years of swimming experience
were included in the study, divided into two groups: experimental group
(n = 11) and control group (n = 11). Table 1 shows the
sociodemographic characteristic s of the total sample. No differences
were observed between the experimental and control group ( p>0.05).
Baseline outcome measures did not show signi ﬁcant differences
between groups ( p>0.05). There was no group-by-time interaction
for the variables related to shoulder range of movement, shouldermuscle strength and scapular position at rest and at maximum
ﬂexion ( p>0.05) ( Table 2 ). Small to medium effect size was
observed in shoulder internal and external rotation ROM,isometric shoulder internal and external rotation strength andscapular position ( η2p= 0.00 —0.10).
4 Discussion
The aim of this study was to analyse the effect of a strengthening
programme for the shoulder rotator muscles using elastic bandexercises in a diagonal Kabat pattern (D2 for ﬂexion) in swimmers,
in order to develop an effective, quick and easy-to-implementprotocol for preventive training routines. In contrast with ourhypothesis, the participants of the experimental group did notshow a signi ﬁcant improvement in shoulder strength, ROM orscapular movement compared to the control group post-
intervention.
Training loads generate an imbalance in swimmers between the
adductor and internal rotator muscles due to overload, while theantagonist muscles do not receive the same training load. Indeed,there is evidence of a mismatch betw een the strength developed by these
muscle groups, altering the agonist-antagonist relationship ( Weldon
and Richardson, 2001 ;Drigny et al., 2020 ) as a potential cause of injury.
However, corrective measures for thi s imbalance should be accessible to
all swimmers, regardless of their com petitive level and technical means.
On the other hand, the natural progression that swimmers
undergo with training is towards muscle imbalance, according todata observed in young swimmers (15 –18 years old), who develop
internal rotator strength with training, but lose external rotatorstrength over 3 years of continuous training ( Habechian et al., 2018 )
It seems logical to assume that the gains in internal rotator strengthare part of the expected athletic development with training.
Therefore, the loss of strength in the external rotators should
alert coaches to take measures to ensure a harmoniousdevelopment of strength in the shoulder complex. The isometricagonist-antagonist RE/RI strength ratio that would be expected inhealthy shoulders should be between 75% –100% ( Cools et al., 2016 ).
However, it is not only muscle strength that is a parameter to be
monitored in the prevention of shoulder pathology in swimmers.Limited glenohumeral mobility is also a risk factor ( Cejudo et al.,
2019 ). According to a cohort study with a 12-month follow-up
(Walker et al., 2012 ), the risk of shoulder pain is multiplied by 8.1 in
swimmers with an excess of range in external rotation and by 12.5 inswimmers with a restriction of joint range in external rotation.However, in a retrospective study, no relationship was foundbetween variability in humeral torsion parameters and rotationranges with athletes ’history of shoulder injury ( Holt et al., 2017 ).
In addition to improved monitoring of agonist-antagonist strength
ratios, it seems sensible to monitor joint ranges as a risk factor
through systematic screening to identify at-risk populations early. Inthe present study, the inclusion of this risk factor as an inclusioncriterion may have provided meaningful results in the studypopulation, as altered scapular kinematics has also been shown tobe a potential risk factor ( Su et al., 2004 ). In contrast, there is no
consensus on which of the therapeutic approaches developed to dateTABLE 1 Sociodemographic data of the total sample, experimental and control group.

to control the agonist-antagonist ratio is the most appropriate
(Yoma et al., 2022 ).
The present study did not obtain the expected results in terms of
muscle strength and shoulder ROM. Our results suggest that could be ap o s i t i v et r e n di ns h o u l d e re x t e r n a lr o t a t i o ns t r e n g t ho rr a n g eo fm o t i o n .A previous study ( Batalha et al., 2015 ) obtained signi ﬁcant results in
terms of muscle strength. With a similar training protocol using elasticbands, they obtained signi ﬁcant differences in the strength of theexternal rotators (not the internal rotators) and in the RE/RI ratio.
There are several reasons for the di fference between the two studies. On
the one hand, the follo w-up was longer (16 vs. 8 weeks) and closer
(supervised training vs. autonomous training). On the other hand, theage of the swimmers (14 –15 years vs. 18 –33 years) and the strength
measurement was isokinetic vs. isometric.
In accordance with the above, the follow-up time seems to be the
key that distinguishes the studies that obtained signi ﬁcantTABLE 2 Outcome measures at baseline and 8 weeks post-treatment.

differences between groups in terms of muscle strength. Protocols
lasting more than 12 weeks ( Batalha et al., 2015 ) proved to be
effective, while those with follow-ups of less than 8 weeks wereunable to demonstrate differences between the proposed approaches(Hibberd et al., 2012 ).
However, a new unknown factor is being analysed here. It seems that
adolescent swimmers ( <18 years) are able to correct muscular
decompensation in the shoulder with training protocols of longerduration (12 –16 weeks) based on strength exercises with elastic bands
(Batalha et al., 2015 ;Manske et al., 2015 ). Nevertheless, the asymmetry
between the present study and these two previous studies does not allow
conclusions to be drawn regarding age , but it seems important to clarify
in the future whether the preventiv e approach could be carried out at any
age or whether it would be essential to carry it out in the early stages of
sporting development. On the other hand, the therapeutic approaches
differ between studies, but all include resistance exercises, for external
rotation of the shoulder. It appears that open kinetic chain dry trainingwas the most appropriate for the correct development of muscle strength(Hibberd et al., 2012 ), so the protocol propose di nt h i sa r t i c l eh a st h e
potential to be effective in overcoming the limitations found.
There are several causes that may have led to the non-signi ﬁcant
results found. The small sample size (22 participants), in addition to
a short follow-up (8 weeks), with a treatment protocol that was too
simpli ﬁed (1 single exercise) and supervision limited to explanation
and correction on the ﬁrst day of treatment. On the other hand, the
variables measured could have been improved with isokineticmeasurement of muscle strength.
The challenge of creating a research protocol that, while
retaining simplicity to encourage swimmer accessibility andadherence, was capable of demonstrating ef ﬁcacy in the control
of risk factors linked to swimming for the development of shoulder
pathology. Further research is still needed to create an followedprotocol for balancing muscle strength and shoulder joint range inswimmers. This protocol should be available to all swimmers,regardless of competitive level, age, ﬁnancial or technical means.
5 Conclusion
The strengthening exercise program showed minimal
improvement in shoulder rotation strength and range of motion.These ﬁndings suggest that the prescribed shoulder-strengthening
exercise could be a quick-bene ﬁcial dry-land training option to
improve external rotation shoulder strength or range of motion, butmore studies with larger sample sizes and more weeks of treatmentare needed to determine the ef ﬁcacy of this protocol.Data availability statement
