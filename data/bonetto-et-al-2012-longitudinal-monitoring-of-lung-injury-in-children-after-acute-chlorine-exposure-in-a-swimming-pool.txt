Rationale: Acute exposure to chlorine gas results in respiratory im-
pairment, but few data are available on the pathobiology of theunderlying lung damage.Objectives: To assess lung function and potential lung damage path-
ways in the acute phase and longitudinally over a 15-mo follow-up
after acute chlorine exposure.Methods: Ten previously healthy children were accidentally exposed
to chlorine gas at a swimming pool because of an erroneous servicingprocedure. The fraction of nitric oxide in exhaled air (F
ENO), exhaled
breath condensate compounds, and serum Clara cell–specific proteinCC16 were repeatedly measured.Main results: In the acute phase, all patients had respiratory distress
(one child required mechanical ventilation) and reduced lung func-tion (median and interquartile range: FVC, 51 [43–60]% predicted;FEV
1, 51 [46–60]% predicted). This was accompanied by low F ENO
(4.7 [3.9–7.9] ppb), high exhaled breath condensate leukotriene B 4
(LTB 4) levels (24.4 [22.5–24.9] pg/ml), and increased serum CC16
levels (mean /H11006SEM, 23.4 /H110062.5/H9262g/L). Lung function returned to
normal in 15 d (FVC, 97% predicted [82–108], and FEV 1, 92% predicted
[77–102]). F ENOreached normal values after 2 mo (12.6 [11.4–15] ppb),
whereas LTB 4levels were still increased (12 [9.3–17.1] pg/ml).
Conclusion: Children acutely exposed to chlorine in a swimming
pool presented a substantial lung function impairment associated
with biochemical exhaled breath alterations, represented mainly
by an increase in LTB 4and a reduction in F ENO. Although lung func-
tion and F ENOimproved within a few weeks, the increased levels of
exhaled LTB 4persisted for several months.

Acute chlorine inhalation results in a variety of dose-related lung
effects ranging from respiratory mucous membrane irritation topulmonary edema with acute respiratory failure, but few dataare available on the pathobiology of lung damage underlyingthis intoxication (1–4). Although recovery is the most likelyoutcome, there is still concern as to the possibility of long-termsequelae (5–9).
There has been increasing interest in the application of nonin-
vasive methods to assess the pathobiological mechanisms under-lying respiratory disorders. In particular, the analysis of biomark-

Internet address: www.atsjournals.orgers in exhaled breath, considering exhaled gases and exhaled
condensate, has been widely used in pulmonology research set-tings (10). Being completely noninvasive, the analysis of exhaledbreath has the potential for addressing unmet medical needs
because the respiratory tract can be repeatedly sampled, en-abling longitudinal studies in a wide range of settings.
Among the broad spectrum of gaseous compounds detectable
in exhaled air, the fraction of nitric oxide in exhaled air (F e
NO)
is the most extensively studied marker. In the lung, NO plays akey role in the physiological regulation of vessel and airwaytone, and it can be altered in several heart–lung diseases (11).
Exhaled breath condensate (EBC) is a ﬂuid obtained by freez-
ing exhaled air under spontaneous breathing conditions andprovides a noninvasive means for exploring several aspects oflung biology and pathobiology. A great variety of moleculesoriginating from the surface of the airways can be measuredin EBC, including proinﬂammatory cytokines, oxidative stressindicators, and other compounds involved in airway inﬂamma-tion, such as arachidonic acid metabolites (12).
Another noninvasive diagnostic approach to assess lung injury
is the so-called pneumoproteinemia concept, that is, assaying lung-
speciﬁc proteins (e.g., Clara cell–speciﬁc protein CC16) in serum
(13). In fact, because CC16 is secreted mainly within the respira-tory tract, its occurrence in the vascular compartment suggestsleakage from the lung into the bloodstream and it is thought toreﬂect both the rate of synthesis and the permeability of thelung epithelium.
Although noninvasive methods are being used for research
purposes and are gradually being introduced in clinical settings(14), there have been no reports on their application in a realclinical scenario after acute exposure to and poisoning with pneu-motoxic substances.
This article reports on the application of noninvasive methods
to assess the possible pathways of lung injury, in the acute phaseand during a 15-mo follow-up, in a group of children accidentallyexposed to chlorine gases in a swimming pool.
Some of the results of this study have been previously re-
ported in the form of an abstract (15).
METHODS
On February 17, 2004, 18 children were accidentally exposed to chlorine
gas during a swimming lesson. After an erroneous servicing procedure,an excessive quantity of chlorine was added to the pool; the water
turned yellow and the children began to feel ill, with coughing, vomiting,
dyspnea, and burning eyes and throat.
Ten children (5 males and 5 females; age range, 6 to 12 yr) were
taken to the emergency department of Padova children’s hospital
(Padua, Italy); six were admitted to the pediatric ward and four to thepediatric intensive care unit.
After admission, the children were evaluated, using standard medi-
cal procedures. In addition, F e
NO, spirometry, and EBC analyses were
performed and serum was stored.
FeNOmeasurement, spirometry, and EBC collection were done in
the ﬁrst 24 h after exposure in nine children, and on Day 4 (after
extubation) in one child needing mechanical ventilation.

The children were then reassessed periodically (on Days 1, 3, 8, and
15 and after 2, 4, 8, and 15 mo). At Month 8, the children also took
an exercise challenge test.
The follow-up protocol was approved by the local ethics committee
and both the parents and the children gave their informed consent totake part in the study.
Fe
NOwas measured at a ﬂow rate of 50 ml/s with the NIOX system
(Aerocrine, Stockholm, Sweden), using a single-breath online methodaccording to European Respiratory Society/American Thoracic Society
recommendations (16). Lung function was analyzed by ﬂow–volume
spirometry according to international recommendations. In addition, abronchodilation test was performed within 3 d of the intoxication.Exercise challenge was done on a treadmill as previously described
(17).
EBC was collected with a condenser formed by ﬁve components: a
mouthpiece set up to work also as a saliva trap, a nonrebreathingpolypropylene valve, a 10-cm Tygon tube, a 50-ml polypropylene vial,
and a Dewar ﬂask refrigerated with ice. Children breathed tidally
through the mouth for 15 min, without using a nose clip. They main-tained a dry mouth during collection by periodically swallowing saliva.
EBC samples were stored at –80 /H11034C in polypropylene tubes until analyti-
cal determinations.
EBC leukotriene B
4(LTB 4) and EBC cysteinyl leukotrienes (Cys-
LTs) were quantiﬁed by ELISA methods as previously described (17,
18).
Serum Clara cell–speciﬁc protein CC16 (collected 3–5 h after intoxi-
cation) was determined by latex immunoassay (19).
As a control group, we enrolled 10 healthy white children, relatives
of doctors and nurses of our hospital, with no history of respiratorydiseases or atopy, matched for age and sex with the intoxicated patients(5 males and 5 females; age range, 6 to 12 yr).
Statistical Analysis
Results are expressed as median and interquartile range, except forCC16 values, which are expressed as mean and SEM, being normallydistributed. Data from intoxicated children were compared over time
by repeated measures analysis of variance, followed by the Student-
Newman-Keuls post hoc test. Correlations were tested by Spearman
rank test. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare biomarker
levels in exposed and control children. Statistical signiﬁcance was as-
sumed for p values of less than 0.05. Statistical analysis was performedwith SigmaStat version 3.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL).

RESULTS
The past medical history of the poisoned children was essentially
negative and none of them had ever had respiratory problems,in particular a diagnosis of asthma. Five children were atopicbut only one was suffering from mild recurrent allergic rhinitis.At the time of the accident, they were all healthy. Results of
the standard medical procedures at admission are shown in Table1. In the ﬁrst hours after the poisoning, all of them were oxygen

gen therapy (2–8 d after intoxication). A child needed mechani-
cal ventilation for 4 d, during which time a bronchoscopy with
bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed. Bronchoscopyrevealed wide areas of deepithelialization, with yellow mem-branes along the trachea and main bronchi. BAL ﬂuid analysisshowed that 90% of cells were neutrophils.
All children were treated with oxygen therapy and inhaled
steroids, and six were also given antibiotics and systemic steroids.The chest X-ray was pathologic in four children, with a pictureof interstitial involvement accompanied in two cases by patchyand irregular areas of density.
FENO
In the exposed children, the median F eNOlevels in the acute
phase (4.7 [3.9–7.9] ppb) were signiﬁcantly lower than in healthy
matched control subjects (10.8 [8.9–12.2] ppb) and gradually
increased during follow-up, reaching normal values at 2 mo (12.6[11.4–15] ppb; Figure 1).
Pulmonary Function Test
Spirometric ﬁndings are shown in Figure 2. In the acute phase,there was evidence of an important reduction in FVC and FEV
1
(median value of 51% predicted for both), with a normal ratio.There was a signiﬁcant improvement in both parameters after3 and 8 d; normal spirometric values were reached 15 d after
the exposure to chlorine (median FVC, 97% predicted; median
FEV
1, 92% predicted). In the acute phase, four patients pre-
sented reversibility to /H92522-agonists, deﬁned as a more than 12%
increase in FEV 1after salbutamol inhalation.
Exhaled Breath Biomarkers
At admission, LTB 4levels were signiﬁcantly higher in the EBC
of the exposed children than in those of the healthy controlsubjects (24.4 [22.5–24.9] vs. 4.7 [3–10.9] pg/ml); their concentra-tion remained high after the ﬁrst 8 d (23.3 [22.4–25.8] pg/ml)and then progressively declined over 8 mo, when they were notsigniﬁcantly different from control subjects (2.5 [0.5–4.4] pg/ml;Figure 3).
Cys-LT levels were also higher in exposed children at admis-
sion than in control subjects (25.6 [13.1–38.3] vs. 7.2 [4–15.8] pg/ml) and then gradually dropped during the follow-up; at 8 mothey did not differ from control subjects (4.3 [2–5.9] pg/ml).
Serum CC16
Only one sampling time was available for CC16 (within 3–5 hof exposure); serum CC16 levels were signiﬁcantly higher in theexposed children than in healthy children (23.4 /H110062.5 vs. 9.5 /H11006
0.5/H9262g/L).

on the day of admission in 9 out of 10 children and thenin all 10 patients during the follow-up after acute chlorineinhalation. (Control values, 10.8 [8.9–12.2] ppb.)
Exercise Challenge Test
The exercise challenge, performed 8 mo after the accident, re-
vealed no exercise-induced bronchoconstriction; none of thechildren had a drop in FEV
1greater than 12% and the mean
FEV 1reduction was 5.5 /H110060.6%.
Correlations
There was a signiﬁcant negative correlation between EBC LTB 4
levels and FEV 1% predicted (p /H110050.01,r/H11005–0.4) and between
EBC LTB 4levels and F eNOvalues (p /H110050.03,r/H11005–0.04). F eNOand
FVC% predicted were not correlated at any time point (p /H11022
0.2 at all time points). F eNOvalues at admission were correlated
with initial clinical severity (p /H110050.03,r/H11005–0.6) and with the
length of oxygen dependence (p /H110050.01,r/H11005–0.7). Atopic and
nonatopic children did not differ in any of the inﬂammatory
markers studied, or in pulmonary function. Seethe online supple-
ment for additional details on the results.

DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study in humans to have
applied noninvasive techniques (exhaled breath analysis) to as-
sess lung injury in a real clinical scenario after acute chlorineexposure and poisoning.
Case reports of lung injuries after acute chlorine inhalation in
occupational environments and also after community accidents
have already been published (1, 3, 4), but they describe lung
injuries in terms of lung function and imaging techniques,whereas little information is available on the underlying lung
pathobiology after chlorine exposure in humans (9, 20).
Biological events in the lung can be evaluated by invasive
methods, such as bronchoscopy and BAL, which have providedimportant insight on the biological processes occurring in lung
diseases, and they still represent the “gold standard.” However,
these methods have limited applicability, mainly because of theinvasiveness of the sampling procedures, which makes them

unsuitable for repeated measurements, particularly in children.
As an alternative, several lung disease biomarkers can be ana-
lyzed from exhaled air and blood (10, 15, 21).
Previous studies reported respiratory symptoms in the acute
phase after chlorine exposure, accompanied by restrictive ormixed deﬁcits at pulmonary function tests, with symptoms fadingover a few days and pulmonary function test ﬁndings returningto normal over a few months in most cases (5, 6). Nevertheless,some authors reported persistent airway hyperresponsivenessand obstruction in association with exposure to respiratory irri-tants and physical exertion even years after intoxication (7, 9).
In this longitudinal study, we found severe pulmonary func-
tion derangement in the ﬁrst week after chlorine inhalation, withprogressive improvement leading to normalization after 15 d(Figure 2). At the exercise challenge performed 8 mo after theaccident, none of the children presented a signiﬁcant drop inFEV
1, suggesting normal bronchial hyperresponsiveness to an
indirect stimulus. However, because direct and indirect chal-lenges are weakly correlated and measure different mechanismsof bronchial hyperresponsiveness, we recognize that the choiceof an exercise challenge instead of a methacholine test may bea limitation of our study.
Fe
NOvalues were lower at admission and in the ﬁrst weeks
by comparison with age-matched healthy control subjects andprogressively increased to normal levels after 2 mo. The low
Fe
NOlevels observed after chlorine inhalation may be the conse-
quence of massive epithelial destruction with subsequent dam-age of NO-producing cells of the airway wall—that is, epithelial,endothelial, and nervous cells (11, 22). This hypothesis is sup-ported by the bronchoscopic ﬁndings of large areas of airwayepithelial loss with proteinaceous exudates in the child whounderwent endoscopy during mechanical ventilation.
Another possible cause of low F e
NOvalues could be the reduc-
tion in lung volumes. However, this hypothesis seems unlikelybecause a nonsigniﬁcant relationship was found between vitalcapacity and F e
NOvalues. Also, steroid therapy could have af-
fected F eNOvalues; however, the lowest F eNOlevels were regis-
tered at admission, when administration of steroids had been
initiated a few hours previously. In addition, F eNOlevels progres-
sively increased in the ﬁrst week, when all children were receivinginhaled steroids.The hypothesis of diffuse epithelial damage is also supported
by the increased values of serum CC16 we observed in the
intoxicated children, which may be interpreted as a sign of injury
to the lung epithelial permeability barrier. CC16 is secretedby polarized cells in the lumen of the respiratory tract, so its
occurrence in the vascular compartment is suggestive of its pas-
sage from the lungs into the bloodstream via the bronchoal-
veolar–blood barrier (13). Moreover, increased CC16 levels,
together with the alveolar inﬁltrates on chest X-rays in two
patients, suggest peripheral lung involvement after chlorine inha-
lation, beside the bronchial damage shown by functional tests.
EBC LTB
4levels were clearly higher in our patients at admis-
sion than in control children. Leukotrienes are potent lipid medi-
ators derived from arachidonic acid metabolism; LTB 4is in-
volved in a number of events, including stimulation of leukocyte
migration from the bloodstream, neutrophil recruitment and
activation, and increased interleukin production (23). The high
EBC LTB 4levels that we observed in the intoxicated children
may indicate active neutrophilic inﬂammation in the airways
of these patients, with the subsequent release of proteolytic
enzymes, O 2radicals, and lipid mediators, resulting in tissue
damage. This is consistent with the differential cell count we
observed in the child needing mechanical ventilation, whose
BAL ﬂuid contained 90% neutrophils. The possible role of LTB 4
in lung damage is further supported by its negative correlationwith the lung function test results. Published data on in vitro
tests also indicate a role for neutrophils in the lung response to
acute chlorine exposure in mice and rats (24, 25).
The high LTB
4levels observed 2 mo after the exposure sug-
gest persistent neutrophilic inﬂammation despite the lack of
respiratory symptoms and the normalization of routine lung
function test ﬁndings. Neutrophil recruitment is probably not
the only factor involved in the pathogenesis of lung injury due
to chlorine inhalation; in fact, chlorine exposure also inducedan increase in EBC Cys-LT levels. These eicosanoids are
produced by several cell types in the lung, including mast cells,
basophils, eosinophils, and macrophages. It is known that Cys-
LT production induces contraction of the airways and vascular
smooth muscle, stimulates mucus secretion, and increases micro-vascular permeability (26).
 

Bonetto, Corradi, Carraro, et al. : Chlorine Inhalation and Lung Injury 549
Taken together, these latter ﬁndings led us to hypothesize a
role for the arachidonic acid pathway in the lung damage seen
in our children, and we speculate that, in addition to steroids,medication inhibiting the 5-lipoxygenase pathway and thus theproduction of LTB
4and Cys-LTs may be useful in such cases
of acute lung injury.
In conclusion, children acutely exposed to chlorine in a swim-
ming pool had substantial lung function impairment associated
with biochemical exhaled breath alterations, represented mainlyby an increase in leukotrienes and a reduction in F e
NO. Although
lung function and exhaled NO improved within a few weeks,
the increased levels of exhaled LTB 4persisted for several
months. These ﬁndings shed new light on the pathobiology ofchlorine-induced lung damage and may suggest new therapeuticimplications for these patients.
