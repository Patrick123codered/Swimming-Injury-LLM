Abstract  1 
Objectives: The International Paralympic Committee has mandated that International Sport 2 
Federations develop sport -specific classification systems that are evidence- based. This study 3 
examined the predictive and convergent validity of instrumented tapping tasks to classify motor 4 
coordination impairments in Para swimming.  5 
Design: Cross -sectional.  6 
Method: Thirty non -disabled participants and twenty -one Para swimmers with brain injury 7 
completed several instrumented tapping tasks as an assessment of upper and lower limb 8 
motor coordination. Para swimmers also completed a maximal freestyle swim to obtain a 9 
performance measure. The predictive and convergent validity of instrumented tapping tasks 10 
was examined by establishing differences in test measures between participants with and 11 
without brain injury and defining the strength of association between test measures and 12 
maximal freestyle swim speed in Para swim mers, respectively.  13 
Results: Random forest successfully classified 96% of participants with and without brain injury 14 
using test measures derived from instrumented tapping tasks. Most test measures had 15 
moderate to high correlations (r = 0.54 to 0.72; p < 0 .01) with maximal freestyle swim speed 16 
and collectively explained up to 72% of the variance in maximal freestyle swim performance in 17 
Para swimmers with brain injury.  18 
Conclusions: The results of this study evidence the predictive and convergent validity of 19 
instrumented tapping tasks to classify motor coordination impairments in Para swimmers with 20 
brain injury. These tests can be included in revised Para swimming classification to improve 21 
the objectivity and transparency in determining athlete eligibility and sport class for these Para 22 
athletes.  23

Introduction  27 
Swimming is one of the inaugural Paralympic sporting events and includes athletes with 28 
physical, visual and intellectual impairment. Distinguishing Paralympic events from their 29 
Olympic counterparts are classification systems that are used to minimise the impact of 30 
impairment on the competition outcome. Para swimming has used a functional class ification 31 
system to classify athletes with physical impairment since the 1992 Barcelona Paralympic 32 
games. The effectiveness and fairness of the system has since been questioned.1-3 This has 33 
prompted World Para Swimming, the international federation that go verns the sport, to 34 
establish international research projects to provide the scientific evidence that underpins a new 35 
classification system in Para swimming.  36 
Some of the most challenging cases in Para swimming classification are those athletes with 37 
congenital or acquired brain injury (e.g. cerebral palsy). These athletes have injury to the 38 
pyramidal or extrapyramidal tracts of the brain that causes altered efferent output and effects 39 
neuromuscular function.4 The clinical features presented by athletes with brain injury include 40 
decreased central motor output, hypertonia, incoordination and coactivation of agonist and 41 
antagonist muscle groups, although the distribution and severity of these features varies 42 
considerably depending on the aetiology of brain injury.4 Research has provided some 43 
understanding of how these clinical features impact on sport and exercise performance,5-7 with 44 
performance deficits being attributed to losses in strength,8 9 joint range of motion10 and motor 45 
coordination.11 46 
Motor coordinat ion, which is defined as the ability to produce skilled movement fluidly, rapidly 47 
and accurately is affected in Para athletes with brain injury.4 10 It is yet to be reported how swim 48 
performance is affected by motor coordination impairment. Swimming speed is fundamentally 49 
dependent on stroke length and stroke rate, increasing either one of these determinants whilst 50 
maintaining the other will increase swim speed.12 13 Motor coordination impairment could limit 51 
stroke length and stroke rate in several ways. For instance, injury to the basal ganglia causes 52 
decreased central motor output and control of antagonist muscles that might affect hand 53 
3 
 
speeds during the above and underwater stroke phases and limit stroke rate;14 and injury to 54 
the cerebellum can affect int er-limb coordination and postural control causing inefficient stroke 55 
patterns.15  56 
The assessment of motor coordination in current Para swimming classification lacks many of 57 
the key measurement properties required for evidence- based classification.16 Para s wimmers 58 
with hypertonia, ataxia and athetosis may undertake several dry -land tests that assess their 59 
ability to ‘coordinate’ their limbs during repetitive single- joint swimming actions (e.g. shoulder 60 
flexion and extension) that are performed at a steady pace and of increasing speed.17 Para 61 
swimmers are given a score from 0 to 5 for each joint based on subjective assessment of the 62 
movement, such as “…moderate range of movement, moderate spasticity with time restricting 63 
movement and/or moderate coordination problems…” for a score of 3.17 While the classifiers 64 
conducting these tests are experts and this is current best practice, these tests are not suitable 65 
for evidence- based classification as they have a high dependence on clinical judgment  and 66 
provide only or dinal -scale measures that are limited when quantifying the relationship between 67 
impairment and performance.16  68 
Previous research has developed instrumented tapping tasks that might provide valid methods 69 
of assessing motor coordination impairment for Para s port classification.10 18 Reciprocal and 70 
discrete tapping tasks that are specific to running, throwing and wheelchair sports have been 71 
shown to be reliable in non- disabled participants, and provide ratio- scale measures that 72 
discriminate between Para athlet es and non -disabled participants.10 18 Further, the difficulty of 73 
tapping tasks can be manipulated to detect intentional misrepresentation of abilities by 74 
evaluating conformity with Fitts’ law.19 Despite these promising results, there is limited 75 
evidence t o suggest that they have a meaningful association with sport performance and no 76 
such work has been undertaken in swimming.10 11   77 
The aims of this study were to: (i) examine the predictive validity of instrumented tapping tasks 78 
to discriminate between part icipants with and without brain injury, and (ii) establish the 79 
convergent validity of instrumented tapping tasks by defining their strength of association with 80 
4 
 
swim performance in Para swimmers with brain injury. If tests are found to discriminate 81 
between participants with and without brain injury and explain activity limitation in swimming, 82 
then they will likely have utility in a revised Para swimming classification system.  83 
 84 
Methods  85 
Data were collected from 51 participants including Para swimmers with congenital or acquired 86 
brain injury and non- disabled participants (Table 1). Para swimmers had received national or 87 
international classification and were undertaking planned training regimes at the time of testing. 88 
Non-disabled participants were between the ages of 18 and 35 years of age and were 89 
undertaking planned exercise, training or competition at least twice a week for a minimum of 90 
80 minutes. All participants gave written informed consent under approved ethical guidelines 91 
from institutional human res earch ethics committees ( 100517ESSHJ and A16892).  92 
Participants completed a questionnaire regarding demographics, their typical training regime 93 
(mode, frequency and duration of training), and training activity on the day of testing. Para 94 
swimmers also prov ided information pertaining to their training experience, competition 95 
standard attained, current sport class, and type of physical impairment. These data were 96 
verified against information obtained from classification records listed in the IPC Sports Data 97 
Management System ( https://db.ipc -services.org/sdms ). Participant’s stature and body mass 98 
were recorded prior to testing. Stature was estimated from sitting height recorded from a 99 
custom -built chair for Para swimmers with no or poor locomotor ability.17 100 
Motor coordination was assessed with novel tapping tasks using custom -made wireless 101 
tapping pads (Ergotest, Porsgrunn, Norway). The tapping pads, which consisted of resistive 102 
touch panels that provided a 0.195 m x 0.10 m target, were connected to a personal computer 103 
via Bluetooth connection with a Muscle Lab data synchronisation unit (Ergotest, Porsgrunn, 104 
Norway). The tapping pads were positioned with a 0.195 m distance between their centres. 105 
Participants comple ted four motor coordination tests: (i) bilateral upper limb tapping, (ii) 106 
5 
 
dominant and non- dominant upper limb tapping, (iii) bilateral lower limb tapping and (iv) 107 
dominant and non -dominant lower limb tapping. The test protocols are outlined in 108 
Supplementary Material Appendix 1. Tests involved the participants completing as many 109 
cycles as possible within 15 s test duration. Participants were instructed to tap as rapidly and 110 
accurately as possible between the two pads. They commenced the tests on their own t ime 111 
and an audio signal was used to notify participants of the end of the test. Following a minimum 112 
of one practice trial, participants completed three trials for each test. Participants were given 113 
at least 45 s rest between consecutive trials.  Trials were deemed successful if above 90% 114 
accuracy was achieved. All trials were recorded using a tripod mounted video camera to verify 115 
the number and accuracy of contacts. The best trial, indicated by the lowest mean movement 116 
time (MMT), was used for analysis. Three Para swimmers with diplegic cerebral palsy were 117 
unable to complete the lower limb tapping tasks due to severe spasticity in the lower limbs. To 118 
provide a ratio- scale score, these participants were given a score representing one complete 119 
cycle (15 000 ms)  for these tests.  120 
Para swimmers’ maximal clean swim speed was assessed over a 10 m calibrated test zone 121 
for their preferred freestyle swim stroke. Clean swim speed was determined using standard 122 
two-dimensional video analysis procedures. Output from a 50 H z video camera (Sony HDR 123 
HC9, Sony Corporation, Japan) placed perpendicular to the swimmers’ direction of travel was 124 
captured using commercial software (Dartfish TeamPro version 7.0, Dartfish UK). Participants 125 
were instructed to reach maximal swim speed pr ior to the start of the 10 m test zone and 126 
sustain maximal swim speed until 5 m past the end of the test zone. They performed two 127 
maximal effort trials separated by a minimum of 3 minutes’ rest and the fastest time to cover 128 
the 10 m test zone was used to c ompute their maximal clean swim speed.  129 
Statistical analyses were conducted using R version 3.4.1 (R Core Team, 2017). Test 130 
measures were log -transformed for analysis . The Shapiro- Wilk test indicated most 131 
variables had non- uniform distribution and so non- parametric techniques were used for 132 
analysis.  Wilcoxon rank tests were used to identify differences between non- disabled 133 
6 
 
participants and Para swimmers. Cliff’s delta (d) was calculated with 95% confidence intervals 134 
to indicate the magnitude of group differ ences.  The magnitudes of d scores were evaluated 135 
as negligible (<0.147), small (0.147- 0.33), medium (0.33- 0.474), or large (>0.474).20 Male 136 
and female participants were pooled for analysis as there was no effect of sex found in the 137 
non-disabled participant  group. Random forest algorithm was used to further examine the 138 
predictive validity of motor coordination tests in discriminating between participants with and 139 
without brain injury. Random forest is a non- linear machine learning technique that uses an 140 
ensemble learning method for classification and regression. Details on the random forest 141 
analysis are shown in Supplementary Material Appendix 3.  142 
Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated to assess the strength of association 143 
between log -transformed t est measures and Para swimmers’ maximal freestyle swim speeds. 144 
An alpha value of 0.05 was used to indicate a significant association. The strength of 145 
correlations was interpreted as negligible (0.0 -0.2), low (0.21 -0.40), moderate (0.41- 0.60), high 146 
(0.61 -0.80) and very high (>0.80).21 Test measures that were found to have a significant 147 
association with freestyle swim speed were included in ensemble partial least squares 148 
regression as dependent variables. Details on model training, internal cross validation and 149 
feature selection methods used in partial least squares regression are shown in 150 
Supplementary Material Appendix 4.  151 
 152 
Results  153 
The results of instrumented tapping tasks in non- disabled participants and Para swimmers with 154 
brain injury are shown in Supplementary Material Appendix 2. Test measures were found to 155 
be reliable in a subsample of 15 non -disabled participants (Supplementary Material Table S2). 156 
Wilcoxon rank tests showed significant differences (p <  0.01) in all test measures between 157 
Para swi mmers and non -disabled participants (Figure 1), with larger differences reported for 158 
non-dominant limb tapping (d = 0.93 to 0.99) compared with dominant limb tapping (d = 0.78 159 
7 
 
to 0.82). Random forest algorithm, that included test measures as predictor vari ables, 160 
successfully classified 96% of participants with and without brain injury (out -of-bag [OOB] error 161 
estimate = 3.92%). The rank importance of predictor variables, and ratio of votes assigned for 162 
individual cases are shown in Supplementary Material Appendix 3.  163 
All test measures had significant correlations with maximal freestyle swim speed, except for 164 
bilateral upper limb tapping, upper limb symmetry score, and lower limb symmetry score 165 
(Figure 2). Supplementary Material Appendix 4 shows the prediction accuracy and error, 166 
internal cross validation, and importance of predictor variables for partial least squares 167 
regression. Dominant upper limb tapping, nondominant upper limb tapping, and bilateral lower 168 
limb tapping were the most important predictors of maximal freestyle swim speed and showed 169 
the best prediction accuracy ( R2 = 0.724, RMSE = 0.184) and stability (cv R2 = 0.675, cvRMSE 170 
= 0.199) when included in partial least squares regression.  171 
 172 
Discussion  173 
Para athletes with congenital or acquired brain injury present some of the most challenging 174 
cases in Para swimming classification. The development of valid tests of strength, range of 175 
motion and motor coordination is a key research objectiv e that is required to guide an 176 
evidence- based classification system for these Para athletes.22 23 This study found 177 
instrumented tapping tasks to be valid tests of motor coordination impairment that can be 178 
included in a revised Para swimming classification system.  179 
Eligibility in Para sport is determined by the type of impairment and whether the severity of 180 
impairment conforms with the minimum eligibility criteria.16 Para swimmers with brain injury 181 
have one or a combination of hypertonia, ataxia and athetosi s, all of which can result in loss 182 
of motor coordination that might affect swimming performance. The instrumented tapping tasks 183 
presented in this study were able to differentiate between participants with and without brain 184 
injury (Figure 1). This result shows that the Para swimmers in this study did in fact have 185 
8 
 
impaired motor coordination, and that the instrumented tapping tasks provide useful 186 
assessments to infer the extent of motor coordination impairment resulting from brain injury.  187 
In support of the above, test measures successfully classified 96% of participants with and 188 
without brain injury using random forest algorithm (Supplementary Material Appendix 3). The 189 
ensemble learning method used during random forest allows the probability of classification to 190 
be attained, which could be useful for determining athlete eligibility. For example, two Para 191 
swimmers were incorrectly classified as non- disabled participants by random forest algorithm, 192 
suggesting they have similar motor coordination to non -disabled participants. On further 193 
inspection it is apparent that there was a degree of uncertainty in the classification assigned 194 
by the random forest model as approximately 35% of the votes were allocated to the priori 195 
case for both Para swimmers (i.e. the Para sw immers were assigned to the correct class 35% 196 
of the time). These Para swimmers had mild or moderate hemiplegic cerebral palsy, and 197 
although they might have achieved similar scores to non- disabled participants in some tapping 198 
tasks, it is evident that they  have some loss of motor coordination in their non- dominant limbs 199 
when comparing their upper (0.64 and 0.79) and lower limb (0.71 and 0.89) symmetry scores 200 
with non- disabled participants (upper limb = 0.88±0.05 and lower limb = 0.94±0.07). These 201 
findings h ighlight the potential of using ratio- scale measures to improve the objectivity and 202 
transparency of athlete eligibility in Para swimming, particularly as most test measures were 203 
related to freestyle swimming performance (Figure 2). Classification models that are trained in 204 
Para swimming cohorts with more homogenous  impairment location and distribution (e.g. 205 
hemiplegic versus diplegic) might improve the accuracy of these models to better guide athlete 206 
eligibility.  207 
An important measurement property of impairm ent tests used in classification is that they 208 
explain activity limitation in the sport of interest.16 All motor coordination test measures, except 209 
for bilateral upper limb tapping  and symmetry scores, were found to have moderate to large 210 
correlations with maximal freestyle swim speed (Figure 2). These test measures also explained 211 
72.4% of the variance in swim performance when included in partial least squares regression. 212 
9 
 
These results evidence the convergent validity of the instrumented tapping tasks in Par a 213 
swimming classification.  214 
In agreement with previous research,23 24 motor coordination tests relevant to the upper limbs 215 
were found to be more important predictors of freestyle swim speed than lower limb test 216 
performance (Supplementary Material Figure S4 ). Indeed, the upper limbs contribute most of 217 
the propulsive force during freestyle swimming,25 and motor coordination impairment of the 218 
upper limbs might impact on hand speeds during the above and underwater stroke phases 219 
and inter -arm coordination associ ated with propulsion and propelling efficiency.14 15 26 It is 220 
interesting that lower limb tapping tasks had moderate to high correlations (r = -0.57 to -0.62, 221 
p < 0.01) with maximal swim speed contrasting with no or low correlations (r = 0.27 to 0.44) 222 
that have been reported previously for lower limb strength tests in a similar cohort of Para 223 
swimmers.23 This infers that lower limb coordination is more important than lower limb strength 224 
in freestyle swimming. Although the lower limbs contribute less to propulsion than the upper 225 
limbs in freestyle, leg -to-arm coordination might impact on the propulsion and propelling 226 
efficiency of the upper limbs,26 27 or motor coordination impairment in the lower limbs could be 227 
collinear with reduced range of motion that causes a poor streamline position and increased 228 
form drag.22 28  229 
Despite the more similar action of the bilateral upper limb tapping task to freestyle swimming 230 
than unilateral tasks, this test was found to have no association with freestyle swim speed 231 
(Figure  2a). This might be explained by different strategies that were used by participants 232 
during this test; although they were instructed to maintain extended arms to encourage 233 
movement at the shoulder joint, participants adopted tapping strategies that involved 234 
movements at the shoulder, wrist and/or finger joints. Further, the larger correlation found for 235 
dominant upper limb tapping compared with nondominant upper limb tapping suggests that 236 
Para swimmers with a relatively unaffected dominant limb might be able to compensate more 237 
effectively for the activity limitation caused by the more affected limb. Similar findings have 238 
10 
 
been reported for strength and range of motion impairment in swimming,23 cycling,29 and 239 
running.9 10  240 
The results of this study support the use of instrumented tapping tasks to derive valid 241 
classification structures for Para swimmers with brain injury. Further research that 242 
establishes the relationship between motor coordination tests and performance in the 243 
other swim strokes will confirm their utility in Para swimming classification.  Cluster 244 
analysis of test measures can derive classes of Para swimmers with similar location, severity 245 
and/or distribution of motor coordination impairment,30 31 or an independent measure of 246 
estimated activity limitation that is derived from test measures can be used to assign 247 
classification.24 However, it is likely that strength and range of motion impairment also explain 248 
activity limitation in Para swimmers with brain injury.22 23 In the only other study to establish the 249 
impact of physical impairment on Para swimming performance, measures of limb length were 250 
found to explain 80% of the variance in 100 m freestyle performance in Para swimmers with 251 
limb deficiency.24 It is intere sting then that motor coordination test measures were found to 252 
account for 72% of the variance in swim performance in this study, despite the absence of 253 
measures related to strength and range of motion that are affected by brain injury. This could 254 
be explained by the fact that most Para swimmers had hypertonia, and severity of motor 255 
coordination impairment might be collinear with strength and range of motion impairment within 256 
this group.32 Indeed, partial least squares regression considerably underestimated  swim 257 
performance ( -0.44 m∙s-1) for one Para swimmer with athetosis who would predominately be 258 
affected by motor coordination impairment. This suggests that motor coordination, strength 259 
and range of motion tests should be used concurrently to guide classif ication of P ara swimmers 260 
with brain injury. Further resear ch in a larger cohort  of Para swimmers , including those 261 
with dyskinesia (i.e. athetosis and dystonia) and ataxia,  is required to establish the 262 
impact  these impairments have on swimming performance.   263 
 264 
Conclusion  265 
11 
 
The development of valid tests of impairment is one of the key challenges in guiding the 266 
development of evidence- based classification systems in Para sport. This study showed 267 
instrumented tapping tasks that were reliable in non- disabled partic ipants, were able to 268 
discriminate between participants with and without brain injury and explained most of the 269 
variance in maximal freestyle swim performance in Para swimmers with brain injury. These 270 
results evidence the predictive and convergent validity of instrumented tapping tasks to classify 271 
motor coordination impairments in Para swimmers with brain injury. Future research that 272 
establishes the relative impact of strength, range of motion and motor coordination on Para 273 
swimming performance is required t o help guide evidence- based classification structures for 274 
these Para athletes.  275 
 276 
Practical implications  277 
• Instrumented tapping tasks can be used to infer loss of motor coordination resulting from 278 
brain injury and determine athlete eligibility in Para swimming.  279 
• These tapping tasks provide an objective estimate of activity limitation in Para swimming 280 
resulting from motor coordination impairment and can be used to assign sport class.  281 
• A revised Para swimming classification system due to be implemented following the 2020 282 
Tokyo Paralympic games can include these tapping tasks to improve the objectivity and 283 
transparency of athlete classification.  284

Test  Description   
Bilateral upper 
limb tapping  Participants were seated in an upright position with a back -rest for 
support. The mid- line of the participant was positioned in line with the 
middle of the two tapping pads that were secured to a table in front of 
the participant. The Participant extended their arms with their hands in a 
fist and their index finger extended, and the two pads were secured to the 
table so that the left and right index finger were positioned in the centre 
of the tapping pads. With their arms extended, participants were 
instruc ted to alternate tapping between the two pads using their left and 
right index fingers as quickly and as accurately as possible. The target area 
of tapping pads was 0.195 m x 0.10 m and were positioned with a 0.195 m 
distance between centres ( Index of difficulty = 0.96) .

Reliability of test measur es in non- disabled participants  
Methods 
Fifteen non -disabled participants repeated the  test battery within a week to examine the test- retest reliability of 
instrumented tapping tasks . Reliability assessments were calculated using Ho pkins’ reliability spreadsheet .1 Paired 
sample t -tests were conducted to identify any systematic change in test measures between repeated trials. Intra -class 
correlation coefficients (ICC) method 3,1, standard error of measurement (SEM) scores expressed in the original units of m easurement, and coefficient of variation (CV) scores were calculated to provide an abso lute assessment of 
reliability .
1 
Results  
Reliability assessments indicated most test measures to be reliable in non -disabled participants (Table S3). Dominant 
lower limb  tapping showed a decrease between repeated trials ( -15±20 ms) although reliability assessments showed 
this test to have high absolute reliability (SEM = 14 ms, CV = 4.6 %) and reproducibility (ICC = 0.93). This test measure 
may prove to be more reliable if thorough familiarisation protocols are used prior to testing . Upper and lower limb 
symmetry scores showed lower ICC values (ICC = 0.42 -0.54) than other test measures in non -disabled participants, 
although SEM (0.04) and CV (4.0 -4.1 %) scores indicate the se test measures might be more reliable in Para swimmers 
with brain injury that have larger variance in limb symmetry (Table S2).

Random forest classificatio n of participants with and without brain injury  
Methods 
Random forest algorithm was used to establish the predictive validity of test measures in classifying participants with 
and without brain injury. Random forest is a non -linear machine learning technique that uses an ensemble learning 
method for classification and regression.2 The ‘randomForest’ package in R was used for analysis.2 Random forest 
included all test measures to predict participants with and without b rain injury using an ensemble of 100 decision 
trees. The number of trees included in random forest was determined using random forest generalisation error that allows the out -of-bag (OOB) error conv ergence along the number of tree s in the forest to be exam ined.
2 
 The importance of predictor variables to classification was determined using the mean decrease in accuracy score 
calculated during the OOB error calculation.
2 The mean decrease in accuracy score describes the decrease in prediction 
accuracy in rand om forest that occurs when a single variable is excluded from the model. So, variables with larger 
mean decrease in accuracy scores are more important to prediction than other variables with lower scores. A feature 
selection method was also used to determi ne which variables could be excluded from random forest to improve the 
stability and parsimony of the model. The ‘ggRandomForests’ package was used to calculate the minimal depth and rank importance of predictor variables.
3 This involved calculating the distribution of minimal depth of variables and 
assumes variables with high impact on the prediction are those that most frequently split nodes nearest to the trunks of the trees. 
4 
 
Results  
The OOB error rate for the random forest was 3.92%. There were two P ara swimmers with brain injury that were 
incorrectly classified as non -disabled participants. The ratio of votes assigned to participants’ prior classification are 
shown in Figure S1. There were 33% and 35% of votes assigned to the prior classification of the Para swimmers that 
were incorrectly classified as non -disabled participants.  
 
 
  
Figure S1.  Ratio of votes to the classifications assigned by random forest algorithm. Ratio of votes (y) are shown for individual 
participants (x).  
 
Variable importance scores are shown in Figure S2. Mean decrease in accuracy and minimal depth sores indicated 
non-dominant upper limb tapping, bilateral lower limb tapping, bilateral upper limb tapping and non -dominant lower 
limb tapping to be the most important variables in  prediction of participants with and without brain injury. The 
variables showed equal rank of importance when examining the mean decrease in accuracy and minimal depth scores 
(Figure S3).

Partial least squares regression to predict maximal freestyle swim speed in Para swimmers with brain injury  
Methods 
The relationship between motor coordination impairment and maximal freestyle swim speed in Para  swimmers with 
brain injury was established using ensemble partial least squares regression. The partial least squares method 
transforms the data to reduce both predictor and response variables to x - and y -components.5 The derived x-
components are then use d to predict the response using regression analysis. The advantage of partial least squares 
regression is that while predictor variables may be colinear, the derived x -components will be independent of one 
another while also keeping most of the variance ex plained in the dataset. The method also has the advantage of being 
a dimension reduction technique , which has advantages w hen analysing datasets with many  predictor variables or 
small sample sizes .  
The ‘enpls’ package in R was used to conduct partial leas t squares regression on 100 Monte Carlo experiments with a 
sampling ratio of 0.8.6 The ensemble learning method might improve the prediction accuracy and stability of partial 
least squares regression by exploiting the statistical distribution of variable c oefficients and prediction errors. Motor 
coordination test measures that were found to have significant correlations (p  < 0.05) with maximal freestyle swim 
speed were included in analysis -  bilateral upper limb tapping was excluded. A maximum of 2 componen ts were 
included in partial least squares regression and K -fold cross validation was used to examine the internal stability of the 
model.  
A systematic approach was used for training, selecting important predictor variables, and improving the accuracy and stability of the model (Figure S4). This involved removing individual cases from analysis and step -wise removal of least 
important predictor variables. The vector of regression coefficients across multiple Monte Carlo experiments were 
used to indicate impo rtance of predictor variables.
6 The variable importance score was calculated as the mean of the 
variable coefficient divided by the standard deviation of the variable coefficient. A larger importance score indicates 
are larger and more consistent regressio n coefficient. The entire participant cohort was included as a new test set in 
the optimised partial least squares regression model to establish the prediction accuracy and stability (Figure S5).  
 
Results  
The systematic approach used to improve the predict ion accuracy and stability of the partial least squares regression 
model is shown in Figure S4. The first partial least squares regression included all participants and test measures that 
had a significant correlation with freestyle swim speed (Figure S4A) . This model explained 72 % of the variance in 
maximal freestyle swim speed (R2 = 0.719, RMSE = 0.185) although internal cross -validation indicated slight overfitting 
of the data (cvR2 = 0.646, cvRMSE = 0.208). The three test measures related to lower limb  tapping were unexpectedly 
found to be the most important predictors of maximal freestyle swim speed (Figure S4A). This could be explained by 
the inclusion of three participants with severe diplegic spasticity that were unable to complete the lower limb tapping 
tasks and were given a score reflecting one complete cycle for these test measures.  
To determine the importance of predictor variables a second partial least squares regression was conducted only 
including participants that had completed all the inc luded tapping tasks (Figure S4B). The importance of predictor 
variables ranked highest to lowest was dominant upper limb tapping, non -dominant upper limb tapping, bilateral 
lower limb tapping, non -dominant lower limb tapping, and dominant lower limb tappin g. A step -wise removal of the 
least important predictor variable was done for a third (Figure S4C) and fourth (Figure S4D) partial least squares regression to improve the parsimony of the model. This resulted in improved prediction accuracy (R
2 = 0.618 vs.  0.605) 
and stability (cvR2 = 0.517 vs. 0.465) of partial least squares regression.  
The entire cohort of Para swimmers were included in a fifth partial least squares regression as a test set to derive predictions of the response using the regression coeff icients from the optimised partial least squares (Figure S5). This 
model that included dominant upper limb tapping, non -dominant upper limb tapping, and bilateral lower limb tapping 
showed slight improvements in prediction accuracy and error (R
2 = 0.724, R MSE = 0.184) and stability (cvR2 = 0.675, 
cvRMSE = 0.199) compared with the first partial least squares regression that included all test measures (Figure S4A).
