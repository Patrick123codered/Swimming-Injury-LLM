 2 ABSTRACT  28 
Shoulder pain is the most reported area of orthopaedic injury in swimmers. The so -called 29 
“swimmers’ shoulder” has been applied to a variety of complaints involving shoulder pain in 30 
swimmers without specific reference to contributing mechanisms  or structures . Knowledge 31 
of dysfunctions associated with swimm ers’ shoulder  can assist clinicians in developing 32 
rehabilitation stra tegies. This literature review aims to providing clinicians insight into the 33 
musculoskeletal mechanisms and impairments  associated with swimmers’ shoulder  that 34 
could aid them in developing rehabilitation strategies . The following musculoskeletal 35 
dysfunctio ns will be discussed: muscle activity, strength, endurance, muscle control , range of 36 
motion, glenohumeral laxity, glenohumeral instability, shoulder posture, scapular dyskinesis. 37 
The findings of this review may have implications for the swimmer , their coac h, and the 38 
rehabilitation specialist working with swimmers . 39

 What is already known ? 42 
1. The voluminous quantity of shoulder revolutions in swimmers can easily overload soft 43 
tissue structures around the shoulder and lead to pain at rest as well as during daily activities 44 
and swimming.  45 
2. The so -called “swimmers’ shoulder” is a term that has generally been used to describe a 46 
syndrome with anterior shoulder pain elicited by repetitive impingement of the rotator cuff 47 
under the coracoacromial arch.  48 
3. The hete rogeneity of ‘swimmers’ shoulder’ and lack of knowledge regarding the etiology 49 
has reduced the ability to define and devise successful interventions.  50 
 51 
What are the new findings ? 52 
1. Reduced shoulder and core trunk endurance is present with swimmers who report 53 
shoulder pain, but it is unclear if poor endurance is a cause or effect.  54 
2. It is unclear whether laxity predisposes swimmers to pain or if it occurs in symptomatic 55 
swimmers as a  result of cumulative microtrauma . 56 
3. Swimming may alter scapular position, but it is unclear if these changes are related to the 57 
development of shoulder pain.  58

INTRODUCTION  61 
Swimming is a unique sport combining endurance , strength  and control  in a non - 62 
weight bearing environment. Highly repetitive upper extremity overhead movements 63 
provide the majority of the propulsive forces for all four main strokes: freestyle, butterfly, 64 
breaststroke and backstroke [1]. Elite swimmers may swim up to 14.000 meters each day, 65 
which requires  more than 2500 shoulder revolutions per day [2] or up to 16.000 shoulder 66 
revolutions per week. This voluminous quantity  of shoulder revolutions can easily overload 67 
soft tissue structures around the shoulder  and lead to pain at rest  as well as during daily 68 
activities and swimming . Shoulder pain  occurs frequently  and is the most reported area of 69 
orthopaedic injury in swimmers. Prevalence rates  of the so -called swimmers’ shoulder can 70 
be as high as  91% i n competitive swimmers [3-5]. Rates vary, depending on age, level of 71 
competition, swim stroke, amount of training, time of season and the definition of shoulder 72 
pain . Symptoms may begin at an early age with 21% of swimmers aged 8 -11 reporting 73 
significant pain , but h igh school swimmers  were found to be the most symptomatic  age 74 
category  [6],[7]. A belie f even exists that shoulder pain is normal and should be tolerated to 75 
complete practice [8]. In fact, a  study of high school competitive swimmers revealed that 76 
72% used pain medication to manage their shoulder pain during practice, with 47% reporting 77 
regular medication use [9]. Shoulder symptom prevalence rates in competitive swimmers 78 
can be some of the highest in competitive sports , and may lead to termination of sports’ 79 
participation [9]. The functional performance scores for active swimmers are even reported 80 
to be quite similar  to those seen in injured athletes in other sports  [10]. 81 
The so -called “swimmers’ sh oulder” is a term that has generally been used to describe  a 82 
syndrome with anterior shoulder pain elicited by repetitive impingement of the rotator cuff 83 
under the coracoacromial arch  [6 11-13]. However, this term has been applied to a variety of 84 
complaints involvi ng shoulder pain in swimmers without specific reference to contributing 85 
mechanisms  or structures . Typically, this diagnosis has been labelled ‘impingement 86 
syndrome’.  Because the mechanism may not be impingement of the rotator cuff, other 87 
terminology has been suggested to include subacromial pain syndrome, rotator cuff related 88 
pain, and rotator cuff di sease to name a few [14-16]. In addition, the swimmers’ shoulder 89 
may reflect many other  causes of shoulder pain located outside  the subacromial space . The 90 
heterogeneity of ‘swimmers’ shoulder’ and lack of knowledge regarding the etiology has 91 
 4 reduc ed the ability to define and devise  successful interventions. Suggested  92 
pathophysiological impairments  include  reduced endurance, incoordination or weakness of 93 
the shoulder muscles, a lack of scapular stability, poor posture , lack of core stability  and 94 
altered shoulder and spinal  mobility  [4 5 11 17], which may predispose swimmers to the 95 
development of swimmer’s shoulder [17]. Knowledge of dysfunctions associated with 96 
swimm ers’ shoulder  can assist clinicians in developing rehabilitation strategies. Although 97 
impairments associated with shoulder pain in swimmers have been studied, there is a lack of 98 
prospective research identifying  the risk factors for the development of swimmers’ shoulde r. 99 
Moreover, i t is not clear to what exten t these associated fact ors are the cause or effect of 100 
the swimmers’ shoulder pain , or if the impairment is a sport -specific adaptation needed for 101 
high level swimming performance .  102 
A critical review  of the dysfunctions in swimmers with shoulder pain will provide the 103 
necessary understanding to assess and develop rehabilitation programs based on 104 
impairment s. It has been suggested that the primary cause of shoulder pain in swimmers is 105 
impingement of the subacromial structures  [12], however the pathology alone does not 106 
define  strategies for rehabilitation  [18]. Consequently, this literature review aims to 107 
providing clinicians insight into the musculoskeletal mechanisms and impairments  associated 108 
with swimmers’ shoulder  that could aid them in developing rehabilitation strateg ies. 109 
 110 
MUSCLE PERFORMANCE  AROUND THE SWIMMERS’ SHOULDER  111 
Several  studies have investigated musc le performance  in swimmers suffering  from 112 
shoulder pain . Muscle performance  is a broad term covering  muscle activity , strength, 113 
endurance,  and control . Knowledge of  muscle performance  is necessary for monitoring 114 
disease progression or the development of secondary disorders in clinical p ractice [19]. 115 
Some studies have analyzed muscle activity  throughout the different phases of a swimming 116 
stroke  using  electromyography  and cinematographic  analysis during freestyle and 117 
breaststroke swimming in swimmers with and without shoulder pain [20 21]. During 118 
freestyle swimming, the rhomboids, upper trapezius, anterior deltoid and middle deltoid 119 
were less active in swimmers  with shoulder pain during the hand entr y phase than the 120 
unimpaired controls. The serratus  anterior demonstrated less activity during the pulling 121 
phase , while the rhomboids beco me more active than in the controls . In addition, in 122 
 5 symptomatic swimmers, the anterior and middle deltoid demonstrated less activity during 123 
the hand -exit phase , while the infraspinatus bec ame  overactive  [20]. Finally, the mid- 124 
recovery  phase was characterized by reduced activity of the s ubscapularis muscle  in painful 125 
shoulders  [20]. During breaststroke swimming, decreas ed teres minor activity was found 126 
during the pulling phase  in painful shoulders  [21].  During the mid - recovery phase, there 127 
was decreased activity of the middle deltoid, upper trapezius and supraspinatus and 128 
increased activity  of the infraspinatus  in swimmers with painful shoulders  [21]. Finally, the 129 
subscapularis  demonstrated a significant ly increased activity during the pulling phase in 130 
those with shoulder pain compar ed to the unimpaired controls  [21]. In addition, Wadsworth 131 
et al. [22] found  increased intra -subject variability in the recruitment of scapulothoracic 132 
muscles in swimmers with shoulder pain when contrast ed to swimmers  without pain . Prior 133 
to shoulder movement, the upper trapezius is activated, followed by serratus anterior 134 
immediately after motion begins. After approximately 15° of shoulder elevation, the lower 135 
trapezius is recruited [22]. Swimmers with a shoulder injury demonstrated the same 136 
sequence , but with more intra -subject variability  [22].  In addition, they  suggested that 137 
swimmers with shoulder pain on one side might have muscle performance deficits on their 138 
unaffected side  [22]. 139 
In addition to muscle activity , several researchers have highlighted the importance of 140 
muscle imbalances between internal (IR) and external rotation (ER)  shoulder strength . 141 
Competitive swimmers present with a significant lower ER:IR ratio compared to non - 142 
swimmers [23] due to stronger IR strength . However, this ratio  is not seen in those w ith 143 
shoulder pain . It is unclear if the  swimmer produces less IR strength due to inhibition from 144 
pain  or if the muscle ratio imbalance is an attempt  to remain pain free . Swimmers with 145 
shoulder pain tend ed to have lower concentric and eccentric IR strength in the painful 146 
shoulder  in one study [24], but others [11 25] did not find any difference in strength 147 
between swimmers having shoulder pain and unimpaired swimmers.  A systematic review on 148 
the risk factors for developing shoulder pain in swimmers confirmed these findings and 149 
stated that there is  insufficient evidence  that IR or ER  strength is a risk factor for shoulder 150 
pain in  swimmers  [13]. 151 
In order to identify factors that differentiate swimmers with and without shoulder 152 
pain  and disability , Tate et al. [6] studied 236 female competitive swimmers. They found that 153 
 6 young (12 -14 year  old) swimmers with shoulder pain and disability had  significant ly less core 154 
endurance (measured by the time held during the side bridge position) than their less 155 
symptomatic colleagues.  Beach et al.  [11] support  these findings by reporting that shoulder 156 
muscle endurance for abduction and external rotation was negatively correlated with 157 
shoulder pain in swimmers. In summary, reduced shoulder and core trunk endurance is 158 
present with swimmers who report  shoulder pain , but it is unclear if poor endurance is a 159 
cause or effect .  160 
 161 
SHOULDER RANGE OF MOTION  162 
Several  studies investigated  the relationship between glenohumeral joint (GH) flexibility and 163 
shoulder pain  in swimmers . Most studies did  not find any significant association between 164 
shoulder pain and shoulder joint flexibility  [11 24 25]. There were 2 studies  [6 26] that 165 
reported a relationship between altered GH ROM and shoulder pain. I n a 12 -month 166 
prospective cohort study in 74 swimmers, Walker et al. [26] found that swimmers with a 167 
high (≥ 100°) or low (< 93°) ER  ROM ha d an increased risk of developing shoulder pain , but 168 
no relationship  between IR ROM  and shoulder pain. In contrast, Tate et al. [6] found  a 169 
relation ship between reduced shoulder flexion and IR ROM  and sh oulder pain  in female 170 
swimmers aged 8-11 years . ROM  was assessed using an inclinometer with the participant 171 
lying supin e[6]. These findings are confirmed by the systematic review of Hill et al. [13], 172 
which demonstrated with moderate certainty that there is sufficient evidence  that reduced 173 
shoulder IR ROM  and either  increased or decreased ER ROM  (measured with either a 174 
goniometer or inclinometer)  is a risk factor for shoulder pain in swimmers. However, recent 175 
studies in an overhead athlete population have highlighted that different methods exist for 176 
analyzing shoulde r ROM for the classification of a shoulder at risk [27 28]. In addition,  these 177 
measures should not be used interchangeably [27 28]. These methods include Glenohumeral 178 
Internal Rotation Deficit (GIRD), Total Rotational Range of Motion (TRROM) and humeral 179 
torsion [27]. However, to the best of our knowledge, no studies examined humeral torsion in 180 
a swimming population.  181 
 182 
GLENOHUMERAL LAXITY AND INSTABIL ITY 183 
 7 Using clinical laxity tests, several authors have found that, in comparison to other athletes, 184 
greater GH laxity exists in competitive swimmers  [1 23 29 30]. However, GH laxity may be 185 
defined as increased humeral head  translation , but  without any complaints  of shoulder pain 186 
[29]. In addition , laxity can exceed  this physiologic boundar y and give rise to complaints  187 
(pathologic  laxity)  when not controlled, resulting in glenohumeral instability [29]. Moreover, 188 
there i s greater laxity in elite swimmers than in recreational swimmers  [30]. McMaster  et al. 189 
[29] examined 40 high level competitive swimmers , of whom 35% (n=14) reported 190 
interfering shoulder pain. T he presence of GH laxity was clinically examined with the  sulcus 191 
sign, ant erior and posterior drawer test s. All clinical tests evaluated humeral head excursion , 192 
and the presence of apprehension.  There was a significant positive correlation between the 193 
presence of pain and the clinical tests  for GH laxity within these competitive  swimm ers. 194 
Rupp et al. [23] clinically examined 22 competitive swimmers and compared them with a 195 
non-overhead sporting population. Sixty -four percent (n=14) of all swimmers reported 196 
shoulder pain. Half of all swimmers (n=11)  -of which 8 had a positive Hawkins test - had a 197 
positive apprehension sign. Indications of GH instability were supported by Bak & Fauno [31] 198 
who studied 36 competitive swimmers (72 shoulder s) of which 68% of shoulders were 199 
painful.  Although no clear statistical significance could be noted, 21 shoulders presented 200 
with a positive apprehension signs. Nineteen painful shoulders demonstrated a positive 201 
anterior drawer test, 16 a positive sulcus sign. Finally, Sein et al. [1] studied 80 competitive 202 
swimmers ; 54%  reported unilateral shoulder pain, 37% reported bilateral shoulder pain and 203 
only 9% reported no shoulder pain. Many swimmers had mild anterior translation (61%),  204 
posterior translation (33%), or a positive  the sulcus sign (51%) . Shoulder laxity correlated  205 
positively with a greater  IR ROM . However, although laxity was correlated with the 206 
swimmers’ amount of pain, Sein et al. did not find a strong correlation  with the swimmers’ 207 
level of competition or hours of training. The latter did relate  to the incidence of 208 
supraspinatus tendinopathy  on magnetic resonance imaging.  Current evidence suggests 209 
uncertainty regarding GH  laxity or instabi lity being a risk factor for shoulder pain in 210 
swimmers  [13] Although frequently identified in s wimmers, it is unclear whether laxity 211 
predisposes swimmers to pain or if it occurs in symptomatic swimmers as a result of 212 
cumulative microtrauma .  213 
 214 
 8 SHOULDER POSTURE  215 
Shoulder posture can be defined by the general shoulder or specific humeral head 216 
position. A prospective study by Mckenna  et al. [7] investigated whether humeral head 217 
position is predictive of the development of shoulder pain in competitive swimmers. They 218 
studied 46 adolescent swimmers. They  concluded  that swimmers who ha d a greater 219 
posterior humeral head position  (larger distance between the anterior humeral head and 220 
the anterior edge of the acromion ) were more likely to  develop shoulder pain.  As highlighted 221 
by the authors [7], it is currently  unknown whether the more posteriorly positioned humeral 222 
head (in relation to the acromion) is due to a change in the acromion  position (more 223 
anterior) or the humeral  head  position (more posterior) .  224 
Because th e pectoralis minor muscle  attaches anteriorly to the scapula , shortening of 225 
this muscle has been related to an altered scapular position and to the prevalence of 226 
shoulder pain [32 33]. It has been suggested  that the pectoralis minor muscle length is 227 
affected by repetitive use, which is often  seen on the dominant side in overhead 228 
athletes [34]. Consequently, the pectoralis minor muscle length is often stud ied when 229 
investigating  altered  shoulder posture [35]. Tate et al. [6] found a reduced resting length of 230 
the pectoralis minor in the high school swimmers with shoulder pain and disability in 231 
contrast to their pain -free controls. These findings are supported by a cross -sectional study 232 
in 37 female collegiate swimmers of Harrington et al.[25] who also re ported a shorter  233 
pectoralis minor muscle length in swimmers with shoulder pain and disability in contrast to  234 
an unimpaired control  group . In summary, current evidence suggests that an anteriorly tilted 235 
scapular position (and potentially shortened pectoralis minor muscle) may play a 236 
predisposing role in the development of shoulder pain in swimmers . 237 
 238 
SCAPULAR DYSKINESIS  239 
Abnormalities in scapular position and scapular motion – termed scapular dyskinesis 240 
– have been linked to shoulder pain [36]. In swimmers, the results are  mixed . Tate et al . [6]. 241 
found that the prevalence of obvious scapular dyskinesis was not different between those 242 
with and without significant shoulder pain  and disability . Interestingly, Tate et al. [6] did find 243 
greater middle trapezius muscle weakness in swimmers with painful shoulders , but not in 244 
other scapular muscles.  A critical threshold of altered scapular muscle activity or control 245 
 9 may be necessary to result in visually altered scapular motion and shoulder pain. Mckenna ’s 246 
et al. [7] prospective study determined that altered scapular position was predictive for the 247 
development of shoulder pain in competitive swimmers. Specifically, those with a more 248 
protracted scapular position (larger distance between the spinous process of the seventh 249 
thoracic vertebrae (T7) and the most inferior point of the sca pula ) were predictive for the 250 
development of shoulder pain in swimmers.  Given these findings, it is unclear if scapular 251 
dyskinesis is involved in the etiology of shoulder pain or results from the repetitive  252 
swimming mechanism.  253 
The effects of swimming on scapular motion has been studied by Su et al. [37] by 254 
measur ing scapular upward rotation in swimmers with and without impingement syndrome 255 
(n=40) before and after  a 1–2 hour  practice  session . There was a  decrease in scapular 256 
upward rotation at 45°, 90° and 135° elevation in those with shoulder impingement  after 257 
practice, but not for the healthy swimmers. However, based on this study [37], it is n ot clear 258 
whether the decrease in scapular upward rotation result ed in a meaningful decrease in 259 
subacromial space , which could  mechanistically relate to the  impingement symptoms . 260 
Interestingly, both groups revealed significant reduction (13 -14%) in strength  after the 261 
practice session, but there were no between -group differences.   Likewise, Crotty & 262 
Smith [38] studied the effect of an intense swimming exercise on scapular position in male 263 
high school swimmers. However, based on their scapular assessment technique, a fatiguing 264 
exercise protocol failed to demonstrate significant changes in scapular position. Rega rding 265 
its predisposing role, there is insufficient evidence that scapular dyskinesis  is a risk factor for 266 
shoulder pain in swimmers  [13]. Swimming may alter scapular position, but it is unclear if 267 
these changes are related to the development of shoulder pain.  268 
 269 
PUTTING IT AL  TOGETHER: MECHANISMS AND IMPAIRMENTS THAT MAY RELATE TO 270 
SHOULDER PAIN IN SWIMMERS  271 
The aim of this review was to investigate the musculoskeletal dysfunctions theorized 272 
to be associated with swimmers’ shoulder. The findings of this review have implications for 273 
the swimmer , their coach , and the rehabilitation specialist working with the sw immers 274 
either after they develop shoulder pain or in a preventative role . However, because of the 275 
non-systematic nature of this review, together with a clear lack of well -powered longitudinal 276 
 10 prospective studies, it is difficult to generalize the results for practice in the evaluation and 277 
treatment of swimmers . Table 1 summarizes the key findings in swimmers with shoulder 278 
pain.  279

 283 
First, this review did not focus on other  than musculoskeletal factors , which may 284 
contribute to shoulder pain and disability , such as stroke technique, breathing pattern, swim 285 
yardage  or body composition . Second, most studies were  retrospective  or cross -sectional in 286 
design, which make it difficult to resolve the cause or effect question. However, based on 287 
the presented evidence, there appear s to be collective themes of asso ciated dysfunction s in 288 
swimmers .  This evidence may benefit the development of  rehabilitation strateg ies and 289 
prevention programs, rather than the use of a single label of swimmers’ shoulder. The 290 
musculoskeletal  dysfunctions highlighted in this review  requi re further study, and in 291 
particular the use of prospective longitudinal research  designs . Regarding muscle 292 
performance , a compensatory muscle activation strategy may be employed in order to try to 293 
maintain optimal motor output  in painful shoulders . These strategies  may vary from subtle 294 
changes in sharing of load with the synergist muscles , to a complete avoidance of a 295 
movement. Redistribution of muscle activity  to synergist muscles  has been demonstrated in 296 
non-swimming individuals with shoulder pain [39-42]. In swimmers after swim practice, a  297 
significant reduction of force (measured with a handheld dynamometer) has been 298 
 11 demonstrated for a variety of shoulder movements [24 37]. A reduction in muscle force has 299 
also concurrently been found in swimmers with altered scapular motion after swim practice. 300 
In addition, it is still a matter of debate on how to interpret muscle activity (EMG) results , 301 
and also how to transfer the  findings to clinical practice.  302 
As highlighted by Beach et al. [11], ER ROM might not be limited; but rather the IR 303 
ROM is limited. This phenomenon, in which the overhead athlete has a GH IR decrease, is 304 
described  as GIRD (Glenohumeral Internal Rotation Deficit) [43]. Shanley et al. [44] found 305 
that a loss of IR >25° was predictive for an arm injury in the overhead baseball athlete s. 306 
However, GIRD is labelled on a left -to-right difference often seen in unilateral overhead 307 
athletes . A side to side difference in IR ROM may not be  present or  as great in swimmers  due 308 
to equal or nearly equal upper extremity use bilaterally . It is suggested that  because 309 
swimming has no abrupt deceleration as other overhead sports, posterior tightness might 310 
occur at an older age  [45]. However, caution should be used in interpreting the results of 311 
Torres and colleagues , as their subjects were recreational swimmers who likely incur 312 
reduced repetitive shoulder use compared to young er competitive swimmers. Tate et al. [6] 313 
and Walker et al.  [26] hypothesized that there may be an ideal range of flexibility  needed to 314 
swim without developing a shoulder injury . According to Walker et al. this could be within 315 
the range of 93°-100°  for ER ROM . As IR ROM was not predictive for pain in Walkers’ study, it 316 
is difficult to  recommend  an ideal IR ROM. In addition, age groups present with different 317 
ROM, their guidelines for an ideal ROM should be based on age categories and gender [6]. 318 
However, as mentioned above, caution must be taken when interpreting t hese results. 319 
Whitely and Oceguera [27] recently explained the impact of humeral torsion on IR and ER 320 
ROM measurements. Humeral torsion is described as the amount of bony twist about the 321 
long axis of the humerus. Grea ter ER torsion (retrotorsion) will increase ER ROM  and vis a 322 
versa [27]. To date , it is still unknown as to  what extent humeral torsion is clinically 323 
important in a swimming population. It is indeed sugge sted that humeral torsion is likely a 324 
result of throwing [27]. Therefore, we conclude that alterations in shoulder rotational and 325 
flexion ROM are seen in swimmers with shoulder pain, but we cannot univocally conclude 326 
that these deficits  are a risk factor  for developing shoulder pain.  327 
An increase in glenohumeral motion in the form of laxity and instability are present in 328 
those swimmers with shoulder pain. However , caution should be taken  before  interpreting 329 
 12 results concerning glenohumeral laxity and instability  tests . The criteria used for labeling a 330 
test result as positive for laxity is excessive humeral head translation . Laxity alone is not 331 
symptomatic. Laxity may be a related mechanism leadin g to overload of shoulder 332 
musculature or other soft tissues. The criterion to confirm symptomatic GH instability is 333 
apprehension, which is suggested to be  a strong and reliable clinical sign for glenohumeral 334 
instability [46 47].  335 
Current evidence showed moderate certainty that forward shoulder posture due to 336 
an anter iorly tilted scapula may play a role in the development of shoulder pain in 337 
swimmers. Interestingly, Lynch  et al.  [48] revealed that the swimmers  (78% with shoulder 338 
pain)  who participated  in the 8 -week stretching and strengthening program had significantly 339 
decreased forward shoulder posture , with the acromion process closer to the wall in post - 340 
exercise testing. However, based on these  results, an exercise regime  could improve 341 
shoulder posture, but  did not reduce their pain levels.  342 
Whether or not scapular dyskinesia i s predictive for shoulder pain is still a matter of 343 
debate. Several prospective longitudinal studies in overhead and rugby athletes have 344 
focused their study on the prediction of shoulder pain based on the presence of scapular 345 
dyskinesia [49-53]. Where as 2 studies  [49 51] found  predictive value of the presence of 346 
scapular dyskinesi a, 3 studies [50 52 53] did not . None of these studies included swimmers. 347 
The only remarkable difference betw een thes e studies is the level of overhead activity. 348 
Apparently , those  studies  that predict ed the development of  shoulder pain  during the 349 
subsequent season  included top -league elite athletes, whereas the studies not predicting 350 
the development of shoulder  pain included recreational high school athletes. One area for 351 
future study would be to investigate if those  with  scapular motion deviations incurring  352 
greater load s on the shoulder  due to higher training levels would be more likely to develop 353 
pain.   354 
High training volume has been frequently reported  as a risk factor for shoulder 355 
injuries in competitive swimmers [1 6 26]. Swimmers at elite level may train for 9 to 12 356 
kilometres per day, six to seven day a week [2], which makes  monitoring  of training load and 357 
training increment important parameter s requiring fu rther investigation . In addition to 358 
training volume , stroke biomechanics  are also of great relevance. Virag et al. [54] 359 
demonstrat ed a high prevalence of stroke errors in a group of collegiate  swimm ers. A 360 
 13 dropped elbow during the pull -through  and recovery phase were the most commonly seen 361 
stroke errors, p resent in respectively 61% and 53% of the included swimmers. Interestingly, 362 
many of these stroke errors where interrelated, which resulted in the authors suggestion 363 
that one error may lead to other errors [54]. High training volume and volume increment in 364 
combination with s troke errors may be an important contributor  to shoulder dysfunction.   365 
Finally, Hibberd et al.  [17] recently highlighted that factors not relating to swimming , such as 366 
school and technology use, may have a sign ificant effect  on posture adaptation s found in 367 
adolescents,  both swimmers and non -overhead athletes [17]. 368 
In conclusion, as swimmers combine  endurance, strength , flexibility  and control in a 369 
repetitive manner , high levels of training might  easily overload soft tissue structures around 370 
the shoulder and lead to pain, dissatisfaction, and disability . This can give  rise to the so - 371 
called “swimmers’ shoulder” in which  suggested pathophysiological factors include red uced 372 
endurance, incoordination or weakness of the shoulder muscles, a lack of scapular stability, 373 
poor posture, and lack of core stability. T his literature review aimed  at providing clinicians 374 
insight into the musculoskeletal mechanisms and impairments ass ociated with swimmers’ 375 
shoulder.  376
