Revista Iberoamericana de Psicología del Ejercicio y el Deporte. Vol. 18, nº 1 (2023)there is more interest in improving physical fitness and preparing players to 
compete in competitions and tournaments, coaches must be interested in learning about the factors that can obstruct these goals, such as injuries that players may be exposed to. Such injuries can lead to a suspension of training during the treatment and rehabilitation period (6). He has conducted a (7) 
studied the status of stamina and its link to swimming players' sports injuries. 
In this study, a descriptive technique was employed on 250 swimmers. The authors reported that 41.3 % of swimmers had stamina deviations in the upper body, %30 swimmers had body deviations in the lower body, and 28.7% of swimmers had a healthy posture. It was concluded that contracture injury was the most common sports injury for swimming players (23 %), followed by muscle strain injury (20.9 %). On the other hand, the cut injury was the least common among swimming players (3.5%). Accordingly, a direct link between inappropriate stature and the degree of sports injuries was established. This study focused on sports injuries related to swimming which are one of the 
issues that impede the development of the sporting level and the achievements 
of the players. Injuries can also lead to a player's permanent retirement. Injury exposure during acquiring or practicing may be an impediment that inhibits the beginners from continuing and participating in this sport. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the most common types of sports injuries, recognize which parts of the body are more susceptible to them, and identify the causes of 
sports injuries among female swimming students at the University of Jordan's 
Faculty of Physical Education. This significance of this is based on including field data and science curriculum that could identify and analyze the most prevalent sports injuries among female swimming students at the University of Jordan- Faculty of Physical Education. Consequently, adequate strategies to reduce injuries among female swimming students could be proposed.

Abstract
This study aimed to analyze the most common sports-related injuries among students in the swimming course 
at the Faculty of Physical Education at the University of Jordan. Moreover, it identified the most common areas of injuries and their causes. The study sample consisted of 60 randomly chosen female students from the 
Faculty of Physical Education Jordan in the year 2018/2019. The descriptive approach was used, and the sports 
injury checklist was distributed. The results showed that the body parts most likely to be injured were the leg 
(20%), the shoulders' joint (15%), and the most frequent types of injuries were muscle cramps (22%), injuries 
(17%), sprains, and bruises (13%). The most common causes of sports injuries were related to lack of a good 
warm-up (22%), lack of the use of sports recovery means (15%), and poor motor technique (13%). The study 
recommended the necessity of following the rules of good warm-up based on a scientific basis, learning the 
correct techniques for skills before performing them to prevent injuries, and paying attention to the use of 
sports recovery after swimming.

Introduction
When scientific and technical factors are not considered during training or competitions, players are subject 
to injury in all games as a result of the continual exertion on various parts of the body (1). Therefore, the 
coach guides to take the correct and early steps to protect the player from serious difficulties that may prevent 
him from continuing his activity in the presence of an injury (2). (3) Reported that sports injuries are the main challenge for the development of the heroic sports level due to injuries complicating effects on the phased evolution of sports training and making it impossible to reach the specified sports goals. Swimming is one of the safest sports because the water lifts and carries the body off the ground, relieving a significant amount of weight from the body (1). As a result, swimming is an excellent sport for those who suffer from various injuries. However, this sport is not risk-free. Due to the variety of swimming forms, methods, and places of training, 
where training can be inside or outside the water, and the use and movement of some muscles that are rarely 
used in daily life, several injuries of different types, causes, and places occur (5). In the world of sports, where

cramps and bruising.
The frequencies and percentages of the different types of injuries suffered by 
the female students were extracted and listed in table 2 (Table 2).
Table 2 shows the frequencies and percentages of the body parts most 
susceptible to female students' injuries. The table clearly shows that the leg is the most affected part (0.20 %). 
This type of injury could be ascribed to the lack of adequate warm-up. Moreover, 
a lack of utilization of sports recovery methods following the training could be responsible for such injuries. On the other hand, the shoulder joint injuries were ranking in second place with a 0.15 % rate of occurrence.  This is obvious since the functional demand on the shoulders is increased during pushing the water and the retrograde movement of the arm.
The frequencies and percentages of the causes of sports injuries among 
female swimming students as shown in table 3 (Table 3).
Table 3 shows the frequency and percentages of the causes of sports injuries 
among females. The results revealed that inadequate warm-up is the most common cause of injury, accounting for 0.22% of all injuries followed by 
neglecting of using sports recovery ways for 0.15%, inadequate technical 
planning was responsible for 0.15%, and poor technical skill preparation by athletes was responsible for 0.13%.
 These findings indicated that the students did not follow the requirements of 
a healthy warm-up, and they were unaware of the importance of warm-up in preventing sports injuries. Moreover, students rush in practicing skills before knowing the correct technique exposing them to various sports injuries.
The findings also revealed the failure of the students to apply sports recovery 
after training, which is essential in recovering the students' ability to handle 
additional training.

THE COMMON SPORTS INJURIES AMONG SWIMMING FEMALE STUDENTS AT THE FACULTY OF PHYSICAL EDUCATION AT THE 
UNIVERSITY OF JORDAN
Revista Iberoamericana de Psicología del Ejercicio y el Deporte. Vol. 18, nº 1 (2023)101recognize which parts of the body are more susceptible to, and identify the 
causes of sports injuries among female swimming students. The study showed 
that muscular spasms, sprains, and muscle bruises are the most common 
sports injuries among Jordanian female swimming students. The study revealed that the calf muscles and shoulder joints are the most affected parts of the body during swimming. Moreover, this study emphasizes that the lack of adequate warm-up, and inadequate technical use of abilities, were the most 
common causes of sports injuries among Jordanian female students.
Based on the finding of this study, a good warm-up based on scientific 
principles is highly recommended before swimming training and competition, 
following the appropriate technique for skills before using them is necessary 
to avoid injuries, and close attention to the use of sports recovery procedures following training sessions should be paid. Moreover, more studies on sports injuries, their causes, and how to prevent them is required must be conducted.
