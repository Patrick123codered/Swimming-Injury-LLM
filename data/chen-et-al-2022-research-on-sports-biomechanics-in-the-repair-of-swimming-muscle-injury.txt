1. Introduction
Chinese elite swimmers' primary type of injury is muscle and ligament strain. Due to
the technical characteristics of di®erent swimming styles, there are di®erences in the
injury site. The occurrence of sports injuries is a combination of multiple factors.
It mainly includes training, physical ¯tness, psychological, and other factors.
Surface electromyography (sEMG) has the advantage of being noninvasive.
It is considered to be the most promising means of estimating muscle strength.
It is well known that sEMG is produced by muscle contraction. Muscle contraction
activity is often accompanied by muscle force. So, there must be a link between
sEMG and muscle strength. Usually, muscle strength is one of the essential indicators
re°ecting the level of muscle health.1Healthy muscle contractions produce corre-
sponding forces. Injured, tired muscles have l ess muscle force. Muscle strength provides a
reliable basis for diagnosis and rehabilitation treatment in clinical application.
Foreign scholars have done a lot of research on the muscle force model. It is
more typical such as the HILL model, but the HILL model does not describe
the chemical –mechanical energy conversion in the potential-to-force conversion
process. The mechanism description is insu±cient. The current approach to studying
muscle force models is often to simulate the signaling of neurons with electrical
stimulation. The method obtains the force through the force measuring equipment and
then analyzes the muscle force model2/C0/C0/C0content such as linear, Wiener, and Cascade.
But general muscle force models are task-speci¯c. The properties of the model are task-
speci¯c. These studies are inconclusive about how similar electrical stimulation signals
are to neuronal signals or the e®ects of electrical stimulation signals on muscles.
The reliability of the muscle force model needs further study.
Current methods to study muscle force are still limited to the relationship
between sEMG and macroscopic pressure parameters such as root mean square
(RMS), integral electromyography (IEMG), mean power frequency (MPF), median
frequency (MF), and other time –frequency domain parameters. In academia, the
relationship between sEMG and force is less described from the perspective of motor
units. This paper explores the relationship between muscle force and sEMG from a
motor unit perspective.
2. Research Methods
We ¯rst perform the sEMG experimental acquisition test. Second, the sEMG is
decomposed using the gradient-optimized convolution kernel compensation (GCKC)
method.3Then the MU waveform was extracted using the spike triggering technique
(STA). Finally, we use the least-squares ¯tting method to establish the relationship
between muscle force and motor unit amplitude.
2.1. sEMG signal decomposition
The sEMG signal was decomposed using the GCKC method. The GCKC
process improves the Convolution Kernel Compensation (CKC) method. HoloberW. Chen et al.

¯rst proposed the CKC method. The following equation can express the mathe-
matical model of EMG signal convolution kernel compensation:

If the jsignal source emits at time n0, then the estimate of the ¯ring sequence of

XXXðnÞ: ð2Þ
XTðn0Þis the transpose of the ¯ring sequence at time n0.C/C01
XXis the correlation
matrix of the detected signal with noise. The signal decomposition is performed by
calculating the pulse ¯ring sequence of a signal source by the above formula.4The
purpose of replacing Xðn0Þin Eq. ( 2) with an average value is to improve the
calculation quality of sj
n0ðnÞ. The GCKC method can process convolutionally mixed
motion unit source signals. This method does not need to calculate the unknown
mixing matrix and directly calculates the source signal, and it is an up-and-comingmethod for decomposing sEMG. The core idea of GCKC utilizes the principle of
similarity to a certain extent between the ¯ring moments of the same motor unit.
This method decomposes the sEMG by convolution kernel compensation without
solving the matrix. GCKC has achieved good results in the application.
2.2. MU waveform extraction
This paper uses the gradient CKC method to decompose the sEMG signal. Then we
used the spike-triggered averaging technique STA to extract the MU waveforms of
the array EMG signals, respectively. In this paper, the release time obtained by
decomposition is used as the trigger event.

muscle forces from MU amplitudes based on waveform amplitudes and frequencies.
2.3. Muscle force-¯tting
This paper uses the least-squares method to estimate the magnitude of muscle force
based on the amplitude of the MU waveform. It is assumed that the estimated value
of muscle force ^Fand the amplitude of MU waveform satisfy the following linear
relationship:

3. Surface EMG Signal Acquisition
3.1. Subjects
We recruited ¯ve subjects for muscle strength experiments. The subjects were in
good health. The average age was 29.4 years old (25 to 36). A total of 3 males and
two females were recruited. Before the experiment, subjects signed an informed letter
about ethics.
3.2. Experimental equipment
Experiments were recorded using a combinable 128-channel REFA device. We only
used 64 channels to acquire sEMG signals during recording. Set the bandpass ¯lter
frequency to 10 Hz to 500Hz, and the acquisition frequency to 2048 Hz. A reference
electrode was placed on the subject's wrist during acquisition. The force measuring
equipment adopts self-developed equipment. We use a six-degree-of-freedom torque
sensor to collect the torque signal and input it to the computer.6This paper uses
virtual instrument technology to develop a human –computer interaction interface
program. We display force magnitude and target force in real-time on the computer.
The electrode spacing is 8.5 mm, and the electrode diameter is 5 mm.
3.3. Experimental procedure
Before the experiment, the subjects' skin was removed with medical abrasive cream
and sandpaper to remove the stratum corneum on the skin of the biceps brachii. At
the same time, use alcohol to disinfect the skin. We evenly coated the electrode arraywith conductive paste and attached it to the biceps.
7At this point, we ¯xed it with
tape and ensured that the electrodes were in complete contact with the skin.
The subjects were seated in a ¯xed chair during the test. First, the issue pushed
the handle three times with the maximum force. Hold for 2s each time, using leading
force each time. We took the average of 3 maximal points as the subject's maximal
contractile force (MVC). Then each subject did four groups of experiments: 5%
MVC, 10% MVC, 15% MVC, and 20% MVC. Do isometric contractions of the biceps
and hold each set for 30 seconds. The subject's arm was forced while the eye observed
the magnitude of the force displayed in real-time on the computer monitor. Since the
monitor also shows the size of the target force, the subjects must try their best to
keep the real-time pressure consistent with the target force during the experiment.8W. Chen et al.

The subjects rested for 2 to 3 min between each experiment. This keeps the biceps
working without fatigue. This experiment needs to ensure the sameness of the motor
units for each release, so we ask the subject's arm to keep the arm position, angle, and
posture unchanged during the whole process.
4. Results and Analysis
The paper guarantees the reliability of the decomposition results of the GCKC
algorithm, so the maximum shrinkage force is selected as 20% MVC. This is because
the GCKC decomposition can achieve better results under the condition of a smaller
shrinkage force.
The practice has proved that the more electrodes there are, the more MUs can be
decomposed. The force used by the subjects here reached 20% MVC. We use 128
electrodes to collect signals, and the upper and lower parts of the electrode array willundergo signi¯cant shape changes, resulting in poor contact of many electrodes. The
64 electrodes can be placed just on the muscle belly, and the deformation of the
muscle is relatively small at this time.
9This does not a®ect the electrode contact.
The distribution of the number of MUs obtained by decomposing the ¯ve subjects
A, B, C, D, and E at 5%, 10%, 15%, and 20% MVC is shown in Table 1. The number
of MUs is obtained while extracting the release time from the GCKC algorithm. That
is, the release time of one MU corresponds to one MU. It can be seen from Table 1
that with the increase of muscle strength, the recruitment number of MU increases.
The results are consistent with previous studies.
Figure 1shows the distribution of ¯ring timing obtained by decomposing the
sEMG signal (Image referenced from 7 Wheels of Motion: Oscillatory Potentials inthe Motor Cortex). We used the GCKC method to obtain the timing of the motor
unit ¯ring from the 64-channel SEMG signal. In Fig. 1, the abscissa is the release
time, and the ordinate is the release amplitude.
10We need to adjust the distribution
time manually. If the distribution interval is too small, we need to delete it, and if it is
too large, we need to increase it. This is because the motor unit ¯ring interval is in the
range of [20 ms, 200 ms]. It can be seen from the ¯gure that the distribution time of
MU is relatively regular. Figure 2is the MU waveform extracted by the spike-
triggered averaging technique STA. We used a 64-electrode array to obtain 64
waveforms. The STA implementation method is as follows: (i) We take the distri-bution time obtained by decomposition as the center. We take the ¯rst 30 ms, the

middle 36 ms, and the last 30 ms as the MU waveform extraction length. This is
based on experience. Because 96 ms can display a complete waveform, a complete
waveform can also be obtained by appropriately changing the display length. This
article only needs to get the waveform amplitude. (ii) The MU waveform is obtained
by removing the average value of the entire waveform.
Figure 3is a ¯tting curve of the sum of all MU waveform amplitudes at 5% MVC,
10% MVC, and 15% MVC for ¯ve subjects. We get the number of MUs under various
muscle contractions from Table 1. We stack the individual MU amplitude extrac-
tions together to obtain the sum of all MU amplitudes under that muscle forcecontraction. It can be seen from Fig. 3that the magnitude of MU increases with
increasing force. We can obtain the parameters of each line by ¯tting the line.
11This
allows us to estimate muscle strength at 20% MVC. The relevant result in the fourth
column in Table 2is the estimated muscle strength of 20% MVC according to the
parameters of each straight line. It can be seen that with the increase of muscle force,
the magnitude and sum of MU are increasing. The two are linear.
Studies have shown that in the case of muscle fatigue, the muscle motor unit will
reduce the ¯ring frequency and increase the force output. Figure 4is the distribution
of the average ¯ring frequency of 5%, 10%, 15% and 20% MVC motor units in 5

subjects. The straight line in Fig. 4is the result after ¯tting.12It can be seen from the
¯gure that with the increase of muscle strength, the average frequency is not regular.
This may be related to the smaller muscle strength studied in this paper. MU is in a
non-fatigue state. Therefore, muscle motor unit ¯ring frequency is inconsistent with
the change law of muscle motor unit ¯ring frequency when fatigued.

Table 2shows the ¯tting results of muscle force using the least-squares method.
We ¯t a straight line to the three data sets of 5% MVC, 10% MVC, and 15% MVC.
We take the value at 20% MVC of the straight line and calculate the ¯tting error
with the test result. It can be seen that only the data appropriate error of B is close to
40%. The correct mistakes of the other four persons are all below 20%. The experi-
mental results are acceptable. The appropriate error of subject B may be the in°u-
ence of muscle isometric error and muscle force posture during the experiment.Because the subjects will pause and rest during the testing of 5% MVC, 10% MVC,
15% MVC, and 20% MVC. In this way, changes in arm posture and angle a®ect the
accuracy of the test. Therefore, subjects must maintain the same stance and pitch
during the trial.
Although sEMG can only record part of the MU close to the muscle surface, each
experiment records the MU in almost the same area. So, the sEMG we get every time
can re°ect the change of force. Since the more signi¯cant the contractile force, the
lower the ratio identi¯ed by the decomposition algorithm, the method in this paper
validates the case where the muscle force is relatively small. Greater muscle strength
is for further study.
5. Conclusion
From the perspective of motor units, this paper studies the changing law of motor
units' amplitude, number, and ¯ring frequency when muscle force changes. The
magnitude and number of motor units increased with muscle force. The ¯ring fre-
quency of MU did not show a certain regularity in the non-fatigue condition. Since it
is di±cult for the subjects to keep the real-time muscle force utterly consistent withthe target muscle force during the experiment, the result leads to an inevitable error
in the relevant results. However, the test results as a whole can still re°ect the
expected e®ect. In this paper, the study of sEMG from a macroscopic perspective to a
muscle motor unit perspective is helpful for an in-depth analysis of the relationship
between muscle force and sEMG. This provides a new idea for the estimation of
muscle force.
