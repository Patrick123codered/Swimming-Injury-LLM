Sub-Aquatic activities

allreceived adequate medical attention, andthismay
wellrelatetothehighproportion whoreceived imme-
diatefirstaid.Swimming wasthesafestofallthesports

tionofinjurieswhichreceived immediate firstaid,to-
getherwiththefavourable comment ofthesecretaries
may,perhaps, beexplained bythepresence ofbathat-
tendants, whohadhadtraining inresuscitation.
