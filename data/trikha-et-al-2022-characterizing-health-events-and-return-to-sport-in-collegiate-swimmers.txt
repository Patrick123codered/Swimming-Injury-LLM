Investigation performed at the University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California, USA
Background: There is limited literature characterizing the incidence, variety, and effects of injuries and illnesses observed in elite
swimmers.
Purpose: To describe the epidemiology of injuries and illnesses affecting elite intercollegiate competitive swimmers.
Study Design: Descriptive epidemiology study.
Methods: This retrospective study utilized a deidentified injury and illness database of National Collegiate Athletic Association
Division I swimmers in the Pacific Coast Conference from the academic years 2016 to 2017 and 2019 to 2020. A health event was
defined as an illness or musculoskeletal injury that was identified by an athletic trainer or team physician. Musculoskeletal injuries
and nonmusculoskeletal injuries and illnesses were stratified by body location. Injuries were further characterized as career-
ending, season-ending, missed time but the athlete returned to sport in the same season, or those that did not cause missed
time. Relative risk (RR) was used to compare the percentage of athletes affected between women and men, with statistical sig-
nificance being defined by a 95% CI not including 1.
Results: Included were 641 collegiate swimmers (301 male, 340 female). There were 1030 health events among 277 women and
173 men, with 635 (61.7%) occurring in women and 395 (38.3%) in men. There were 540 musculoskeletal injuries reported, most of
which involved the shoulder (n ¼126; 23.3%), spine (n ¼95; 17.6%), foot/ankle/lower leg (n ¼81; 15.0%), knee/thigh (n ¼67; 12.4%),
and hand/wrist/forearm (n ¼52; 9.6%). A total of 490 nonmusculoskeletal health events were reported and included events such as
respiratory tract infections (n ¼119; 24.3%), unspecified medical illness (n ¼93; 19.0%), concussions (n ¼58; 11.8%), ear infections
(n¼25; 5.1%), and gastrointestinal illnesses (n ¼24; 4.9%). Compared with male swimmers, female swimmers were at a higher risk
of sustaining both musculoskeletal injury (RR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.22-1.83) and nonmusculoskeletal injury/illness (RR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.04-
1.68). There were 58 documented concussions, with 8 (13.8%) being season-ending, but not career-ending and 14 (24.1%) being
career-ending. Women had a higher rate of concussion (9.1% vs 4.3% for men; RR, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.13-3.96).
Conclusion: This retrospective study identified the most common injuries and illnesses observed among elite collegiate swim-
mers. Awareness of the incidence and outcome of injuries and illnesses that affect competitive swimmers may allow for more
targeted analyses and injury prevention strategies.
Keywords: illness; injuries; return to sport; swimming
Swimming is a unique low-impact sport involving prone
positioning and hydrodynam ic resistance that requires
high levels of energy expenditure as well as cardiovascular
training.11,17Thus, the injury patterns of this sport can be
distinct from most other collegiate sports. Elite swimmers
train an average of 2 to 4 hours a day and perform repeti-
tive upper and lower extremity movements at high-
intensity levels.14,17,26As a result, the observed injury
patterns are thought to be largely the result of overuse and
tend to occur in a training environment rather than in
competition.10,17,22,30Despite the 12,980 women competing
on 560 National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA)swimming teams and the 9799 men competing on 444
teams during the 2018 to 2019 academic year nationwide,
the epidemiology of injury patterns and illnesses that affect
elite swimmers and how they affect return to sport is
largely uncharacterized.12
Given the repetitive nature of overhead exercises associ-
ated with swimming, an overwhelming majority of the cur-
rent literature has focused on assessments of joint laxity,
muscle imbalances, and other biomechanical derangements
of the shoulder.5,32This is perhaps because shoulder inju-
ries are widely reported to be the predominant injury pat-
tern observed in this patient population. NCAA swimmers
have been reported to have low baseline shoulder func-
tional and performance scores compared with other over-
head athletes.33,38Furthermore, Olympic swimmers have
been found to have a high prevalence of rotator cuff andThe Orthopaedic Journal of Sports Medicine, 10(4), 23259671221083588

biceps tendinopathy.28The complex static and dynamic
properties of the relatively unconstrained shoulder joint,
in combination with the unique cyclical biomechanics of
any given competitive swimming stroke, have been the
rationale for the observed hyperlaxity, scapular dyskinesis,
labral damage, subacromial impingement, and glenohum-
eral rotational instability commonly diagnosed in the com-
petitive swimmer.21,32,33
Although the shoulder is the most injured body part
among competitive swimmers, a variety of other injuries
have also been reported. Knee injuries have been reported
to comprise 3.1 %to 17.7 %of injuries observed among com-
petitive swimmers and are also thought to occur due to
overuse.9,23,33Furthermore, up to 75 %of breaststroke
swimmers report medial knee pain during their athletic
career.23The technical intensity, repetitive propulsive pat-
tern, and the inherent mechanical imbalance of the knee
when performing breaststroke probably increase the risk of
knee pain and injuries.18Lower back injuries are another
relatively common reported area of injury in competitive
swimmers, with some studies suggesting an even higher
incidence of back injuries than shoulder injuries.20,33The
lumbar spine is subjected to prolonged and repetitive
hyperextension during all competitive swimming strokes,
thus placing a tremendous load on the lumbar region,
which is hypothesized to predispose these athletes to
chronic lower back injuries.25Data on nonmusculoskeletal
injuries and illnesses observed among competitive swim-
mers are generally limited; however, an epidemiologic
study of all collegiate sports has suggested a low incidence
of concussions in swimmers.39
There has been little published epidemiologic data of
injuries and illness health events among collegiate swim-
mers compared with athletes in other collegiate sports. As
studies are often further limited by the lack of return-to-
sport data, there is an identifiable need for epidemiologic
studies in this patient population. This study aimed to
characterize the injuries a nd illnesses observed among
NCAA Division I male and female competitive swimming
athletes and to determine which injuries and illnesses
affect return to sport.
METHODS
University men’s and women’s swimming rosters from
respective websites of institutions making up the Pacific
Coast Conference (Pac-12) were queried to determine the
total number of male and female competitive swimmersduring the 2016 to 2017, 2017 to 2018, 2018 to 2019, and
2019 to 2020 academic years. At hletes who transferred
institutions within the Pac-12 conference were excluded
from the analysis. Care was taken to ensure that athletes
who remained on the team roster for multiple years were
not included more than once when determining the total
number of athletes included in this database.
The study protocol received an exemption from institu-
tional review board approval. Given our institution’s mem-
bership in the Pac-12, we were able to acquire retrospective
injury and illness data for the 2016 to 2017 through 2019 to
2020 academic years from the Pac-12 Sports Injury
Research Archive. This data included all male and female
collegiate swimmers from Pac-12 universities who had a
documented health event defined as an injury or illness
as reported by athletic trainers or physicians of respective
university medical staff. These data were blinded and
obtained in aggregate such that the data were appropri-
ately deidentified. Musculoskeletal injuries stratified by
body part, concussions, physical illnesses, and mental
health events were included for analysis. Body parts
included were as follows: shoulder, chest/abdomen, knee/
thigh, foot/ankle/lower leg, hip/groin/pelvis/buttock,
elbow/upper arm, head/face/neck (excluding concussions),
and hand/wrist/forearm. Specific injury or illness diagnoses
as well as sex differences were also included in the analysis.
Health events were recorded as occurring in practice, com-
petition, or in a nonsport setting completely unrelated to
swimming.
Whether or not the athlete experienced any time away
from competition was recorded for each health event. It
was documented if the athlete did not miss any time from
sport, if he or she missed time but returned in the same
season, if one did not return in the same season (season-
ending), or if one did not return to sport at all (career-
ending).
In a separate analysis, the top 2 performing men’s and
women’s teams each year at their respective NCAA Divi-
sion I Swimming and Diving Championships during the
period spanning 2016 to 2020 were compared against the
remaining teams to determine whether the top 2 perform-
ing teams showed any difference with regard to injury and/
or illness patterns.
All statistical analyses were performed using Microsoft
Excel Version 16.49 (Microsoft Corp) in consultation with
the biostatistics core facility at our institution. “Athletes
affected” was defined as the number of athletes having at
least 1 of the recorded healt h events during the 4-year
observation period. “Estimated athlete risk per year” was

used as a surrogate for risk per athlete-year since observa-
tion periods were not known for each individual athlete due
to the data being blinded. We estimated that, on average,
athletes were followed for 2. 3 years, which assumes an
equal number of freshmen, sophomores, juniors, and
seniors per year and no athletes transferring/quitting. For
example, a freshman in 2016 would be followed 4 years, a
senior in 2016 would be followed 1 year, a freshman in 2017
would be followed 3 years, and so forth, with 2.3 years being
the weighted average. Relative risk (RR) was used to com-
pare the percentage of athletes affected between sexes,
with statistical significance being defined by a RR 95 %CI
not including 1 ( P<.05).
RESULTS
Between 2016 and 2020, a total of 641 collegiate swimmers
competed at Pac-12 institutions and were included in our
analysis, with 301 (47.0 %) being male and 340 (53.0 %)
being female. Of those 641 athletes, 450 (70.2 %)w e r e
reported to have a defined health event and were included
in our analysis. Of these 450 athletes, 173 (38.4 %)w e r e
male, and 277 (61.6 %) were female. In total, 1030 total
health events in these 450 athletes were included foranalysis, with 395 (38.3 %) occurring in male swimmers and
635 (61.7 %) occurring in female swimmers.
Musculoskeletal injuries accounted for 540 health
events, including 126 (23.3 %) shoulder injuries, 95
(17.6%) spine injuries, 81 (15.0 %) foot/ankle/lower leg inju-
ries, and 67 (12.4 %) knee/thigh injuries. Overall, 17.3 %of
collegiate swimmers were observed to be affected by a mus-
culoskeletal injury at any point during an academic year
during our observation period. These athletes were at a
6.9%risk of sustaining a shoulder injury, a 5.7 %risk of
sustaining a spine/back injury, and a 5.1 %risk of sustain-
ing a foot/ankle/lower leg injury (Table 1). Nonmusculoske-
letal conditions accounted for 490 recorded health events,
the most common of which were respiratory tract infections
(n¼119; 24.3 %), unspecified medical illnesses (n ¼93;
19.0%), concussions (n ¼58; 11.8 %), ear infections (n ¼
25; 5.1%), and gastrointestinal illnesses (n ¼24; 4.9%). Col-
legiate swimmers were at a 5.4 %risk of having a respira-
tory tract infection, a 3.0 %chance of sustaining a
concussion, and a 1.4 %chance of having an ear infection
in a given year (Table 2). Of note, 50.4 %of musculoskeletal
injury events occurred in practice (n ¼272 events); 13.5 %,
in the weight room (n ¼73 events); 8.1 %, in a non–sport
related event (n ¼44 events); and 3.9 %, during competitionTABLE 1

athletes sustained a concussion as compared with 13 (4.3 %)
out of 301 male athletes. Women were at a 4.0 %risk of
sustaining a concussion in a given year, whereas men were
at only a 1.9 %risk. Out of 58 concussions, 34 (58.6 %)
resulted in missed time but with a return to sport within the
same season. Out of 58 concussions observed in this series, 8
(13.8%) were season-ending injuries, whereas 14 (24.1 %)o u t
of 58 were career-ending (Table 4). Of the concussions, 11
(25.6%) out of 43 in women and 3 (20.0 %) out of 15 in men
were career-ending.The most common diagnoses of the 540 musculoskeletal
injuries were lumbar strains (n ¼34; 6.3 %), lateral ankle
sprains (n ¼25; 4.6 %), shoulder impingement (n ¼21;
3.9%), biceps tendinopathy (n ¼18; 3.3 %), and shoulder
tendon overuse injuries (n ¼13; 2.4 %) (Table 4). Only 3
(2.4%) out of 126 of shoulder injuries were season-ending
compared with 0 out of 67 knee/thigh injuries that were
season-ending. Only 1 (0.8 %) out of 126 shoulder injuries
were career-ending compared with 5 (7.5 %) out of 67 of
knee/thigh injuries that w ere career-ending. Table 5TABLE 3

DISCUSSION
The current breadth of literature analyzing injuries and
return to sport among elite swimmers is limited by number
of studies, methodological lim itations, and/or sufficient
sample size; thus, it is generally accepted that there is an
identifiable current demand for research addressing this
knowledge gap.10,33,37The current study used a health
database from the Pac-12 conference to better understand
the prevalence of injuries and illnesses as well as associated
return to sport among male and female collegiate swim-
mers. Although the current study analyzed swimmers from
the Pac-12 conference, the authors believe these results are
comparable with all collegiate swimmers.Shoulder injuries accounted for 126 (23.3 %) out of the
540 total musculoskeletal injuries seen in this study
(Table 6). Although the shoulder was expectedly the body
part most commonly affected in musculoskeletal injuries,
only 1 out of the total of 126 shoulder injuries was career-
ending. Furthermore, only 3 other shoulder injuries were
season-ending, indicating that although it is well known
that shoulder conditions are highly prevalent among
swimmers and shoulders were the body part most com-
monly injured in our study, these injuries may not signif-
icantly affect a swimmer’s ability to return to sport. Out of
all 126 shoulder injuries, 85 (67.5 %)d i dn o tr e s u l ti na n y
missed competition time. This is relatively consistent with
findings from Wolf et al37demonstrating that 32 (58.2 %)
out of 55 shoulder injuries did not result in any missed
competition time. As particular attention is paid to the
shoulder in these athletes, there may be a lower threshold
to diagnose such conditions, leading to the recognition ofTABLE 4

more minor injuries than otherwise may have been docu-
mented. This could be the rationale behind the relatively
high return-to-sport rate observed in our study with
regard to shoulder injuries.
Spine/back injuries were also relatively common in our
population, accounting for 95 (17.6 %) of the 540 musculo-
skeletal injuries, with lumbar strains being the most com-
mon musculoskeletal-specific diagnosis. Back injuries are
understood to be relatively common in swimmers and are
t h o u g h tt ob ef r o mo v e r u s e .1,13Furthermore, overuse as
well as excessive hyperextension has been indicated as a
factor that predisposes swimmers to degenerative disk dis-
ease, spondylolysis, and spondylolisthesis.24As a result, it
is not surprising that lumbar spine injuries were commonly
observed in our series.
While knee injuries are thought to be the next most com-
mon body part injured in swimmers, the results of the cur-
rent study suggested that injuries below the knee (foot/
ankle/lower leg) accounted for 81 (15.0 %) out of 540 muscu-
loskeletal injuries and were more common than knee/thigh
injuries (n ¼67 out of 540; 12.4 %). Matsuura et al20
observed that an increase in the incidence of knee injuries
over time corresponded to the introduction of the startingblock between 2008 and 2010; they hypothesized that the
kick start using these starting blocks may be the rationale
behind this increase. It is possible that the load applied to
the structures below the knee during this kickoff may also
contribute to the relatively high rate of foot/ankle/lower leg
injuries seen in this study; however, it is worth noting that
track start starting blocks are used infrequently out of
competition.
Several significant sex-based differences were noted in
our results. Overall, women were at a significantly higher
risk of sustaining any musculoskeletal injuries (RR, 1.5;
95%CI, 1.22-1.83) in a given year. Women had an 8.4 %
risk of sustaining a shoulder injury in a given season,
which was significantly higher compared with men
(5.2%)( R R ,1 . 6 ;9 5 %CI, 1.1-2.33). Women were also at a
significantly higher risk of sustaining a spine/back injury
(7.2%vs 4.1%in men) (RR, 1.77; 95 %CI, 1.16-2.71) or a
foot/ankle/lower leg injury (6.4 %vs 3.6%in men) (RR,
1.77; 95 %CI, 1.12-2.79) (Table 1). It is plausible that
anatomical differences b etween male and female hip
structures predispose female swimmers to lower body
injuries. Furthermore, it has been reported that psychoso-
cial factors can discourage men from reporting symptomsTABLE 6

compared with women, and this could account for the sex
differences we observed in this study given the relative
uniformity in significantly higher risk of musculoskeletal
injury in women.15
Another interesting finding of the current study was the
relative high rate of concussion. Concussions affected 44
(6.9%) of the 641 athletes included in this study (Table 7);
14 of those athletes had their career ended by these concus-
sions. The concussion rate in this study is much higher than
the 1.7 %rate suggested in the limited literature on concus-
sions in swimmers.37As more attention has been placed on
the health effects and long-term sequelae of concussions in
recent years, this difference in concussion rate may be
attributed to increased recognition of concussion mechan-
isms and symptoms. This study also found that female
swimmers were significantly more likely to sustain a con-
cussion than were male swimmers (RR, 2.11; 95 %CI, 1.13-
3.96) (see Table 2). This is inconsistent with the limited
literature on swimming injuries claiming that there may
not be a difference in concussion rates between male and
female swimmers.3That being said, several sex comparison
studies in other sports have demonstrated that female ath-
letes have higher rates of concussions than their male coun-
terparts at the high school, collegiate, and professional
levels have.4,6,7,29,34,39The rationale behind this difference
is poorly understood; however , possible theories includeneuroanatomical and/or biomechanical differences as well
as psychosocial factors that may cause male athletes to
underreport symptoms.4,15,31While this study could not
comment on mechanisms behind the observed sex differ-
ences in concussion rates, these results also showed that
women had a slightly higher incidence of concussion’s being
career-ending (n ¼11 out of 43; 25.6 %) compared with men
(n¼3o u to f1 5 ;2 0 . 0 %). A systematic review by Koerte
et al19suggested that, although no definitive conclusions
can be made regarding sex differences for sports-related
concussion outcomes, the majority of evidence suggests
that women generally have worse clinical and neurologic
outcomes after sports-related concussion. This may explain
the higher rates of concussion being career-ending in
women observed in our study. While contact sports such
as football and rugby get more attention with regard to
concussion prevention and management, these results sug-
gested that concussion prevention programs and treatment
protocols specific to the sport of competitive swimming
should be developed.
Respiratory tract infections were the most common med-
ical illnesses in our population, accounting for 119 (24.3 %)
out of 490 of all illnesses. Although respiratory tract infec-
tions are among the most common illnesses regardless of age
or sex, swimmers have been shown to be particularly predis-
posed.27This is thought to be due to intense training in aTABLE 7

Interestingly, a review article by Falagas et al8suggested
that, in general, male patients are likely to be more suscep-
tible to respiratory tract infections than are female patients
in all age groups. In the current study, no significant sex
difference was noted with regard to respiratory tract infec-
tions (Table 2). With the relative high rates of respiratory
tract infection in swimmers, routine screening procedures
for these illnesses should also be a consideration.
Limitations
This study had several limitations in addition to the those
inherent in a retrospective study. We only captured 4 aca-
demic years’ worth of data (2016-2020) among collegiate
swimmers; therefore, long-term follow-up data to determine
how acute injuries/illnesses affect these athletes in the long
term, including return to sport outside of intercollegiate
competition, are difficult to ascertain. Using this data set,
we were unable to definitively identify the reasons for an
athlete’s not returning to sport after an injury or illness.
Presumably, a majority of athletes did not return to sport
solely due to the actual injury or illness; other factors such as
personal choice or psychosocial factors could certainly also
be involved. The current study was also not well equipped to
stratify injuries based on mechanism, acuity, or severity as
detailed injury, and treatment reports were not available.
This level of detail would allow for a more comprehensive
classification of the injuries and illnesses that affect colle-
giate swimmers. More specific to this data set, 93 (19.0 %)o u t
of 490 of nonmusculoskeletal illnesses were categorized as
“unspecified,” as there were no detailed data available. Fur-
thermore, diagnoses captured in this database could be
assigned by a variety of members of the medical team,
including athletic trainers, physical therapists, primary care
physicians, orthopaedic surgeons, and psychologists. Thus,
the diagnostic criteria and the diagnostician were undefined
in this data set across multiple institutions, which presents a
theoretic confounder that is challenging to quantify. The
data presented in this study were also not stroke specific,
which limited more nuanced, biomechanical associations
with specific injury patterns. For instance, evidence has sug-
gested that the high angular velocity at the knee associated
with the breaststroke kick predisposes swimmers to medial
knee injuries.16,36Another limitation to this study was that
there were no data with regard to the number of exposures
(practices, workout sessions, competitions) for each school,
and it was assumed that the number of exposures between
teams and genders was relatively comparable. Despite these
limitations, this study remains 1 of the largest and most
comprehensive epidemiologic studies characterizing injuries
and illnesses among high-level competitive swimmers.
CONCLUSION
Most current injury prevent ion strategies in swimming
focus on the shoulder; however, these results suggestedthat swimmers sustain a variety of musculoskeletal inju-
ries and nonmusculoskeletal health events including con-
cussions at alarming rates that warrant closer attention.
Understanding the incidence of the diverse health events
observed among elite competitive swimming athletes can
inform clinicians regarding the natural history of common
injuries and illnesses. This knowledge may help sports
medicine practitioners better manage the expectation of
these athletes with regard to return to sport after injury
and illness, as well as allow for more targeted injury pre-
vention strategies, that may ultimately serve to prolong the
career of elite competitive swimmers.
