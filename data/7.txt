Abstract  
Analysis of the condition of the students (research sample) shows a genetic 
diversity of ACE I/D, with a 75% frequency of ACE DD, followed by the ACE 
ID gene isotope by 25%. The aero bic training program has a positive effect 
on the biochemical variables under consideration, where there were 
statistically significant differences between the tribal and dimensional 
measurements in favor of dimensional measurement. Students who have 
an AC E ID gene respond to aerobic training more than female students who 
have an ACE DD gene. To emphasize the knowledge of ACE I/D genetic 
diversity for young people as they approach practice to discover the 
potential that well -founded training can transform i nto effective 
capabilities. Selection of female students in sports and aerobic -games is 
based on the ace ID gene pattern. Conduct such research on larger and 
more diverse samples in the field of sports with various collective and 
individual activities. Stu dy different types of genes nominated to influence 
physical performance Candidate genes, which may have an effective effect 
on the development of physical performance and thus may enable us to

Introduction  
There is no doubt that the  repercussions of the era governed by science 
and technology imposed on us one way and there is no alternative to his 
behavior in pursuit of progress, which is the path of scientific research, 
which has become one of the most important necessities of moder n society 
to reach the highest levels in all areas of life, by recognizing the different 
abilities and energies god has given to man in an attempt to achieve the 
greatest possible use of modern scientific theories and develop them to 
serve society. The hum an genome project is one of the most important 
scientific discoveries reached in the modern era, which aims mainly to 
know the complete genetic structure of man, and this project became the 
main concern of scientists and researchers in the field of biotech nology, 
where the huge amount of information it provided contributed to enable 
them to understand the mechanism of biological systems and solve the 
code of genetic information. (Hussein, 2010)  
Literature review  
The sports field has been greatly influenced by modern technology in 
the field of molecular biology, where sports physiology and training are no 
longer limited to the study of physiological changes at the level of biological 
organs only, but the nature of modern studies has evolved to the level of

 study of those changes at the cell level and what is within the cell of 
fibrosis, muscle wicks, mitochondria and enzymes, and this came as a 
natural development inherent in the rapid development of scientific 
discoveries in the field of molecular biology. (Abu Ala, 2003)  where modern 
sports training relies mainly on modern scientific knowledge and 
information, and on taking into account the individual differences between 
female students in physical, psychological, motor and physiological abilities, 
in additio n to the importance of subjecting sports training programs 
according to different levels of athletes to achieve the optimal 
development of players. (Peter, 2001)  Therefore studies and research in 
the field of sports is one of the important aspects that hel p to achieve high 
mathematical achievements, which can only be achieved through the 
application of the results of recent scientific theories reached Research, in 
order to identify different biochemical and physiological changes at the 
level of different ce lls and tissues of the body, which are associated and 
influenced by the genetic structure of the cell, which varies from athlete to 
athlete.  (Abu Ala, 2003) (Bahaa al -Din, 2008)  points out that genetics is 
one of the modern sciences that have entered the sports field in the 
modern era, where developed countries began to work with the theories of 
this science to reach the highest levels of sports, through the use of 
modern technology in the field of genes in athletes to help improve and 
develop performance through the early physical selection and employment 
of young people, guiding and training them according to their biological 
characteristics. (Bahauddin, 2008)  And (Hussein, 2003)  adds that genes are 
responsible for 50 percent of the world's population. Di fferences between 
athletes in athletic performance, as well as the interpretation of individual 
differences in performance among athletes, are also credited with

 explaining what athletes should do in the future to reach higher levels 
better, so genes may b e more important than training in explaining 
differences in performance. (Hopkins, 1998)  states that to be a high -
performance athlete you need the right genes. He adds that one of these 
genes has been discovered, ace gene, which symbolizes the enzyme that 
activates the converted Angiotensin Converting Enzyme, which converts 
Angiotensin1 into anjutensin2. He points out that a working group in 
London has found that the ACE gene is active in the muscle tissue where 
blood flow is regulated, and that this gene c omes in two forms: I)) insertion 
input code, otosion (D) code of cancellation and it is recommended that 
athletes test DNA because knowledge of ace genetic diversity will help 
explain individual differences when responding to training. (Schneider, 
2001)  points to the importance of the role of genes, especially ace gene in 
athletic performance, in order to reach the highest levels of sports and add 
that ace gene is important in effectively influencing physical performance. 
(Hussein, 2003)  considers the ACE gene to be important in determining the 
athlete's maximum oxygen consumption and the size of the left ventricle of 
the heart, as well as the gene determines the type of muscle fibrosis. And 
identify the genetic and molecular foundations of the muscles Structural in 
terms of its characteristics and its response to sports training at the 
beginning, and follow -up DNA and its effects on the gene expression 
responsible for the response to contraction and metabolic effect on the 
structural syst em has been discovered within certain limits where it needs 
further study, and it is important to show the role of genes in the response 
of the structural muscles to sports training as such experiments will provide 
sports workers with the necessary informa tion about the molecular 
mechanism involved in the adaptation of the skeletal muscles.  (Hussein,

 2003)  And (Bahauddin, 2008)  said that aerobic training is a physical 
performance that takes place at a moderate or slow speed where the 
amount of oxygen is su fficient for the exertion, i.e. training in the presence 
of oxygen. Sports training aims to bring about the process of adjustment to 
perform physical functions with a certain degree of strength for a longer 
period in the face of fatigue and requires some p hysiological, chemical and 
neurological effects, where most of these effects are summarized in two 
directions, one related to the improvement of air and aerobic energy 
production systems and the second associated with the nervous system. 
The problem with r esearch is that scientific research Which dealt with 
sports training processes in swimming relied on some factors and 
determinants biological and morphological and psychological and did not 
care about the aspects related to genetics as a new global trend i n the field 
of sports research in general and swimming sports in particular in order to 
reach the best ways to achieve sports achievements (Ahmed, 2003)  and by 
the knowledge of the researcher and her specialization in swimming 
attracted her attention the l ack of scientific research that dealt with the 
genes responsible for sports performance in swimming and its relationship 
to the digital level so the researcher wanted to go through this experiment 
through the study of the impact of the exercises In accorda nce with the 
genetic diversity of some biochemical variables and the digital level of the 
students of the Faculty of Sports Education and Sports Sciences in 
swimming. This prompted the researcher to move towards modern and 
non-traditional scientific method s, by identifying the aerobic training 
effects according to genetic diversity and its relationship to some 
biochemical variables and digital level in swimming for students of the 
Faculty of Sports Education and Sports Sciences, due to the importance of

 linking genetics and molecular biology and the different effects of sports 
training. (Hazam, 2007)  
Methodology  
The researcher used the experimental method using the experimental 
design of one experimental group to conduct tribal and dimensional 
measurement d ue to its suitability for the nature of this study.

 withdrawing the blood sample size (3 million) from each player by the 
competent doctor, using plastic sorrans and then emptying them in test 
tubes numbered numbers that match the order of the research sample 
members, and was saved in (Ice Box), until transported to the laboratory. 
Put in the tube (1 ml of reaction solution (Pyruvate + NADH) with PH 
solution) at a temperature (37) °C until the temperature is gained, then put 
(20) microliters of serum in the water bath for exactly one minute, then 
move to the measurement cell (Qofit), and read a t wavelength (340 nm) 
every minute for (3) minutes. The attrition rates are measured when the 
wavelength (340) nm is based on the NAD composition rate) which is 
directly proportional to the activity rates. LDH), then calculating the reading 
rate per minute  (A), then taking the average of the three readings, 
multiplying the resulting result ing x coefficient (0.4796) and the result is 
equal to the enzyme activity rate and unit/l.  
● Lactic acid measurement: The Akport was used to measure the 
concentration of la ctate in the blood for the research sample, and the 
following steps were followed in the measurement: the device was turned 
on by pressing the operating key (on), and then fed the device with the 
code number of the chip pack used to measure lactate. A slid e was taken 
from the slide tray and placed in the hole at the bottom of the device, then 
opened the edge of the bottom device to show the slide placed in the 
device. Immediately after the edge of the lower device is closed, (the 
screen will remain cleared for 60 seconds but the countdown begins to 
zero), and when the count reaches zero, the device releases a whistle, 
displaying the value of the lactate with blood.  
● Preparation steps for the aerobic training program: reference survey 
of Arab and foreign scien tific references and previous and related research

 studies. Survey of recent foreign studies from the Internet as well as 
research topics. Expert opinion poll in order to identify them on the most 
important exercises used in the aerobic and aerobic trainin g program.  
● The foundations and principles of the design of the training program: 
the training loads of the air training program should be suitable and 
suitable for the age phase of the research sample. Following the principles 
and principles of sports trai ning in the design of the training program. The 
flexibility of the training program should be adjustable by deletion or 
addition in accordance with the conditions created during the program. 
Take advantage of previous and associated studies in the design o f the 
training program.  
● The foundations and principles of training used in the preparation 
and design of the training program: warm -up and calming: each training 
begins with warm -up and ends with calming down. Privacy: There are key 
elements that must be s ubject to the specificity of training, including 
energy production systems - the type of muscle strength required to 
perform motor performance - the nature of the implementation of motor 
performance in different situations. Progress with training pregnancy  
grades: Pregnancy grades should not be fixed but should increase over time 
and according to abilities and adaptation. Diversity: The need for a change 
in training from performance to comfort and easy to difficult. The ripple 
form of the training campaign:  this means the height and fall to carry the 
training and not to walk at one pace or level.  
● Time distribution of the training program: Through the reference 
survey, the 9 -week training program was limited to 3 training units per 
week, with a daily training  unit time of 120 minutes.

 biochemical variables in favor of dimensional measurement, where the 
value of (Z) was statistically significant at the level of indication (0.01), and 
the rates of improvement in biochemical variables ranged between 
(10.39%, 48.04%) in favor of dimensional measurement.  
The researcher attributes these results in the improvement of 
biochemical variables to the use of the aerobic training program where the 
energy supply at the point of deviation of the heart rate is pneumatic, 
where students consume large amounts of oxygen during the performance 
of aerobic exercises, and this cycle re quires increased use of red blood cells, 
because they are responsible for carrying oxygen to cells, and therefore the 
rates of consumption are higher than the consumption of the heart muscle 
and skeletal muscle to large amounts of lactic acid and converted  to 
perocionic, whether in the heart or muscle, This cycle helps to continue the 
performance of the sport for a longer period. According to ( Butova, 2009 , 
Mohammed, 2002) the improvement in biochemical variables during 
physical performance depends not only  on the low concentration of lactic 
acid in the blood during and after the exertion, but also related to the 
activity of the hydrogen -extractive enzyme (LDH) in the slow and rapid 
muscle fibers, as the activity of the ldh enzyme that prevails in the rapid 
fiber supplant encourages the process of converting peruvianic acid into 
lactic acid, On the other hand, the enzyme (LDH) which is prevalent in slow 
muscle fibers helps to convert lactic acid into pericacid, and consequently 
the process of formation of lac tic acid in fast muscle fibers occurs faster 
than in the slow muscle fibers, and this actually occurs during the research 
experiment, where the increased degree of resistance faced by the student 
during performance by raising the degree of pregnancy, incre ases the rate 
of reliance of the student on the fast muscle fibers to face such fibers of

 biochemical and physiological properties enable shaping of the functioning 
of In light of the high level of performance during work on the motorcycle 
or moving, which  results in a higher level of formation of lactate and 
increased ability of female students to continue to perform. According to 
these results and in line with them, (Passarella, 2008 ) (Simeon, 2006)  
indicates that the improvement in biochemical variables is due to the 
presence of training effects with high tensions, which reduce the 
percentage of lactic acid and reduce its presence in the blood and the 
speed of its disposal, as part of the acid Lactic is equated with the same 
blood by vital organizations t hat maintain the PH level and regulate the 
concentration of hydrogen ion (H) to the concentration of hydroxyl ion 
(OH).

 The rese archer attributes the existence of statistically significant 
differences in favor of dimensional measurement and improvement in the 
digital level in swimming for the training of the air training regulated and 
the training contained for the tolerance of dif ferent speeds, as well as the 
work of the same muscles involved in different situations aimed at delaying 
the accumulation of lactic acid and the speed of disposal and speed of 
hospitalization, and was for that positive effect clear in improving the 
tolera nce of speed and performance, which led with aerobic training in the 
availability of oxygen to a positive effect to develop the level of physical 
performance. These findings are consistent with (Mohammed, 2001) that 
the less intensity in the similar repeti tive exercises, the greater the player's 
ability to use air oxygen, so that the work takes the character of speed and 
performance. This is what ( Bahaa al -Din, 2000)  points out, that genetic 
factors play a key role in determining the different characteristi cs and 
characteristics that differentiate athletes, and that differences in genetic 
preparations that distinguish athletes from another, affect their 
performance in general during training and competitions. (Mohammed, 
2002)

 Table 6 shows that there are statistically significant differences between 
the dimensional measurements of the total research sample in lactic acid 
and LDH enzyme after maximum effort in favor of female students with ACE 
ID, where the value of (Z) was statistically significant at the level of 
indic ation (0.05) each, while there are no statistically significant differences 
between the research sample in the enzyme (LDH during rest). The 
researcher attributes this improvement in biochemical variables due to 
aerobic training effects according to the ge netic diversity ACE ID, which 
varies from athlete to Another, where students with genetic diversity (ACE 
ID) are characterized by the speed of transfer of lactate from blood and 
muscles to the heart and non -working muscles, and increase the flow of 
oxygen -laden blood to the muscles, and also increase the efficiency of 
working muscles involved in performance for as long as possible without 
reaching the muscle fatigue, in addition to increasing the activity of the 
enzyme extractive of hydrogen. Found in muscl es (m -LDH) in the speed of 
conversion of lactate to perocidal and the speed of disposal, thus helping to 
continue the athletic performance for as long as possible, while students 
with genetic diversity (ACE DD) are characterized by remarkable slow 
transfer  of lactate from blood and muscles to the heart The non -working 
muscles and the rapid accumulation of lactate within the muscles and 
blood, as well as the lack of activity of the hydrogen -extractive enzyme in 
the muscles (m -LDH) in the conversion of lactat e to pericarcepe, which 
leads to increased accumulation of lactate and the feeling of muscle fatigue 
of athletes.

It is clear from table 7 that there are statistically significant differences 
between the dimensional measurements of the total research sample in 
the digital level of swimming in favor of female students with ace ID, where 
the value of (Z) was statistical ly significant at the level of indication (0.05). 
The researcher attributes this apparent difference in the proportions of 
change to the different version of the gene owned by the students where 
the superiority of the students who possess the ACE ID gene, which 
indicates the response of these students to aerobic training by a higher 
percentage than the students who possess the ACE DD gene. This is 
consistent with bahauddin Salama's assertion (2008) that ace gene can be 
used in the selection of young people as diversity (II), (ID) which produces 
small amounts of the converted ACE enzyme leads to less blood vessels 
constriction, which increases the amount of blood received to the muscles, 
thus increasing the numbers of mitochondria and increasing red blood cel ls 
within the muscles, as well as the percentage of red muscle fibers is greater 
than white muscle fibers and all these qualities are characteristic of aerobic 
activity players. These findings are consistent with the findings of a study 
(Hazem, 2007)  that young people with an ACE ID gene are better physically 
and digitally improved than those with the ACE DD gene, indicating that 
these young people are more responsive to aerobic physical work.

 1- Analysis of the condition of the students (research  sample) shows a genetic 
diversity of ACE I/D, with a 75% frequency of ACE DD, followed by the ACE 
ID gene isotope by 25%.  
2- The aerobic training program has a positive effect on the biochemical 
variables under consideration, where there were statistically s ignificant 
differences between the tribal and dimensional measurements in favor of 
dimensional measurement.  
3- Students who have an ACE ID gene respond to aerobic training more than 
female students who have an ACE DD gene.  
4- To emphasize the knowledge of ACE I/D genetic diversity for young people 
as they approach practice to discover the potential that well -founded 
training can transform into effective capabilities.  
5- Selection of female students in sports and aerobicgames based on the ace 
ID gene pattern.  
6- Conduct such research on larger and more diverse samples in the field of 
sports with various collective and individual activities.  
7- Study different types of genes nominated to influence physical 
performance Candidate genes, which may have an effective effec t on the 
development of physical performance and thus may enable us to develop a 
model for selecting players for different activities in order to achieve the 
required level of achievement by selecting promising elements.
