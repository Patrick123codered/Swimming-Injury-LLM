Injuries in Water Polo
281 www.cmj.hr>  Croat Med J. 2007;48:281-8
Water polo originated in mid-19th century Eng -
land and Scotland as an aquatic form of rugby foot -
ball (1). Players used “pulu,” an inflated, vulcanized 
rubber ball imported from India, pronounced 
“polo.” The game became known as water polo 
and that name has been used ever since. Water 
polo first appeared in modern Olympics in Paris 
in 1900, making it the earliest and longest-running 
olympic team competition. It has been traditional -
ly dominated by Europeans – Hungary, Spain, It -
aly, Croatia, Russia, Greece, and Serbia, but in the 
last decades the popularity of water polo has been 
constantly growing in the USA, Australia, Canada, 
and Asia.
The modern game of water polo is a unique com -
bination of swimming, throwing, and martial arts. 
Physiologically, it is extremely demanding, because it 
is comprised of intense burst activity of less than 15-
second duration, followed by lower intensity inter -
vals of less than 20 seconds. Water polo is becoming 
more physical than ever (2). This results in a number 
of typical acute traumatic events such as contusions, 
lacerations, sprains, dislocations, or fractures (3). On 
the other hand, vigorous training with numerous 
repetitions of ball throws, swims, or kicks may result 
in overuse injuries (4). This review covers, in system -
atical fashion, the most important acute and overuse 
injuries in water polo by analyzing four different re -
gions of the body: head, spine, upper extremities, and 
lower extremities.
Head injuries
Facial injuries
Close contact among water polo players and high 
ball velocities of 60-70 km/h frequently cause head and facial injuries (Figure 1). Sometimes, be -
nign head injury can quickly deteriorate into a 
life-threatening condition and it is critical to en -
sure maintenance of a proper airway in short time. 
Water polo is unique because the physician or the 
coach must rely on other players to bring the in -
jured athlete to the pool side for evaluation. The 
most common types of injuries are facial lacera -
tions, especially of the supraorbital region, requir -
ing immediate treatment. Direct contact with an -
other player carries sufficient force to fracture the 
thinner bones of the face. Fractures of the facial 
bones represent severe head and face injuries, and 
immediate medical evaluation and x-ray assessment 
are necessary. In all facial or head injuries, players 
must be closely monitored for signs of disorienta -
tion, poor balance, and coordination. Also, the pa -
tient must be awakened at regular intervals during 
the night for the first 24 hours (5).
Swimmer’s ear (otitis externa)
Otitis externa is an inflammatory process of the ex -
ternal auditory canal. It is so common among peo -
ple who spend many hours in water that it has be -
Figure 1.  Close contact between players may result in different injuries 
of the head, face, and hand.Cover PageCover Page
come known as the swimmer’s ear (6). The most 
common precipitant of the swimmer’s ear is ex -
cessive moisture that removes cerumen and in -
creases pH of the external auditory canal, which 
provides a good setting for bacterial growth (7). 
Thorough hygiene of the auditory canal is es -
sential for diagnosis and treatment. In addition, 
acidification with a topical solution of 2% acetic 
or boric acid, combined with hydrocortisone for 
inflammation is an effective treatment in most 
cases and, when used after exposure to moisture, 
is an excellent prophylactic.
Trauma to the ear drum
Traumatic perforation of the ear drum is unfor -
tunately a fairly common injury in water polo 
(8). The injury is the result of a slap on the side of 
the head with a cupped palm. This causes a dra -
matic rise in pressure in the canal. The increased 
pressure causes rupturing and development of a 
hole in the tympanic membrane. In most of the 
cases, this injury will heal without any significant 
impairment, but during the healing phase players 
should be kept out of water (9). If this is not ac -
ceptable due to necessity of training or competi -
tion, swimming may be allowed with molded ear 
plug and a bathing cap.
Eye injuries
The most frequent eye injuries in water polo can be 
roughly divided into three main categories (10,11).
Corneal abrasions.  One of the most frequent 
injuries to the eye occurs as a result of a scratch 
from either a fingernail or foreign body. The treat -
ment of corneal abrasions includes the instillation 
of antibiotic eye drops and padding of the eye.
Hyphema.  Bleeding into the anterior cham -
ber of the eye results from ruptured iris vessels 
and may be visible on slit lamp examination. The 
aim of the treatment is to prevent further bleed -
ing, which may in turn result in uncontrollable 
glaucoma or blood staining of the cornea. The 
patient needs to rest in bed while the hemor -
rhage clears, usually 3 to 5 days.Blow-out fracture of the orbita . Blow-out frac -
ture of the orbita is the result from a direct trau -
ma caused by a fist or a ball. Compression of the 
globe and orbital contents produces a fracture in 
the weakest part of the orbita, the orbital floor. 
Contents of the orbita may herniate through 
the defect. The patient typically presents with 
a periorbital hematoma, protruding or sunken 
eye, double vision on upward gaze, and numb -
ness of the cheek. A detailed examination of the 
eye must be performed to exclude intraocular 
injuries. Surgery may be required to release the 
trapped muscle and repair the bony defect.
Spine injuries
Due to the fact that many anatomical structures 
in the spine region may be the source of pain, it 
is often very difficult for a clinician to determine 
the exact cause (5).
Repetitive cervical spine rotation required for 
breathing in freestyle swimming often produces 
neck pain in water polo players. A relatively com -
mon injury that can be extremely painful for the 
player is acute wry neck. It is characterized by a 
sudden onset of sharp neck pain with deformity 
and limitation of movement. It occurs either af -
ter a sudden, quick movement or on waking.
After a direct blow from an opponent player, 
acute acceleration/deceleration injury to the cer -
vical spine can occur. Acute cervical nerve root 
is characterized by moderate to severe arm pain 
(12). Neck pain may or may not be a feature. The 
pain is aggravated by the movements of the cervi -
cal spine. There may be associated sensory symp -
toms. In older athletes or those who had previ -
ously suffered trauma to the neck, osteoarthritis 
may develop, particularly affecting the apophy -
seal joints. Headache, shoulder, and upper arm 
pain are often associated with neck pain, which is 
very important in differential diagnosis.
Low back pain is a common symptom in wa -
ter polo players because the amount of rotational 
forces is significant during throwing and passing Croat Med J 2007;48:xxx

283the ball (13). Any of the pain-producing struc -
tures of the lumbar spine may cause low back 
pain, but the intervertebral discs and the apoph -
yseal joints are the most common causes (14). 
With low back pain of lengthy duration, a num -
ber of factors will contribute to the overall clin -
ical picture. These may include abnormalities of 
the ligaments of the intervertebral joints, mus -
cles and fascia, as well as neural structures. Low 
back pain is usually associated with hypomobil -
ity of one or more intervertebral segments (15). 
The assessment of the segments mobility is a ma -
jor component of the examination of the athlete 
with low back pain. Correction of segmental hy -
pomobility forms an important part of the treat -
ment program. Acute nerve root compression in 
the lumbar region is usually the result of an acute 
disk prolapse. In the acute phase, the most ap -
propriate treatment is rest in a position of maxi -
mum comfort with administration of analgesics. 
Surgery may be required if neurological signs per -
sist or worsen. If bowel or bladder symptoms are 
present, emergency surgery may be necessary.
There is a number of different techniques 
available for the correction of these spine ab -
normalities (16) – manual therapy to the joints 
(mobilization, manipulation, traction), muscles 
(massage therapy and dry needling), and neural 
structures (neural stretching).
When acute spinal injury is suspected, assess -
ment begins on the field, with the ABC proto -
col (17). Airway maintenance is vital as circula -
tion is usually not disturbed. Any unconscious 
athlete or any athlete who complains of numb -
ness, weakness, paralysis, or neck pain should be 
assumed to have cervical spine injury until prov -
en otherwise. Spinal immobilization is much 
more difficult when performed in the water and 
requires team work coordination. Taking the 
players with spinal injuries out of the water is a 
particularly important aspect of aquatic sports, 
especially water polo and diving. Aquatic spine 
boards and neck collars should always be avail -
able on the pool decks at competitions. The head needs to be immobilized in a neutral position 
and flexion and extension movements should be 
particularly avoided.
Upper extremity injuries
Shoulder trauma
Water polo players are also at risk for traumatic 
dislocations and subluxations of the glenohumer -
al and the acromioclavicular joints from contact 
with opponent players or the ball. Both injuries 
usually occur to the throwing arm during the act 
of shooting or passing the ball, when the player 
has the arm in the cocked position, holding the 
ball. The force may be great enough to rupture 
the anterior capsule and glenohumeral ligament 
complex (Bankart lesion), resulting in anteroin -
ferior subluxation or dislocation (Figure 2) (18). 
Posterior dislocation is less frequent. Closed re -
duction of acute shoulder dislocation is a treat -
ment of choice. Although there are still some 
controversies regarding the necessity of opera -
tion, most authors nowadays recommend imme -
diate arthroscopic stabilization in a subset of pa -
tients who are younger than 30 years and are top 
athletes (19-21). Arthroscopic Bankart repair of 
anterior capsulolabral lesions with use of suture 
anchors is a treatment of choice (22).
Swimmer’s shoulder (shoulder pain)
Shoulder pain is the most common musculoskele -
tal complaint in water polo players. The incidence 
of shoulder pain is directly correlated with the lev -
el of competition and years spent competing in the 
sport. According to the data published in scientific 
literature it can reach up to 80% (23,24). It can be 
clearly demonstrated by magnetic resonance im -
aging (MRI) that various pathological changes are 
present even in those players that are completely 
asymptomatic (25). Swimmer’s shoulder is a mul -
tifactorial clinical entity of a hypermobile gleno -
humeral joint, which allows increased translation 
of the humeral head in the glenoid. This multidi -
rectional instability (MDI) leads to problems of 
Croat Med J 2007;48:281-288
284impingement against the undersurface of the acro -
mion, the coraco-acromial ligament, and occasion -
ally, the coracoid process. Internal impingement 
is the unique condition in sports that require ab -
duction and extremes of external rotation, such as 
those seen in late cocking stage of shot at goal or 
pitching (Figure 3) (26). This is a result from the 
contact between the posterior glenoid rim and the 
posterior aspect of the insertion of the supraspina -
tus and the superior aspect of the infaspinatus in -
sertion into the posterior greater tuberosity (27). 
Most of the athletes with swimmer’s shoulder can 
be successfully treated nonoperatively, with a spe -
cific exercise program. If a 6-month trial of non -
operative management fails, the patient is a candi -
date for surgical reconstruction. The treatment of 
choice is arthroscopic capsular plication (28).
Rotator cuff injury
Injury to the rotator cuff among water polo play -
ers can include tendinopathies, partial thickness 
tears, and full thickness tears. In younger age 
groups, repetitive microtrauma and macrotrau -
ma are the main causative factors, but with ag -
ing the etiology of the rotator cuff lesions shifts 
to degenerative. The diagnosis is based on de -
tailed clinical examination, followed by ultra -
sonography and magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) (29,30). Although these imaging meth -
ods show similar accuracy in diagnosis of rota -
tor cuff lesions, significant advantage of MRI is 
its ability to show the concomitant pathologic le -sions. In general, the approach to the rotator cuff  
itself is similar to that in any sport. Athletes suf -
fering from tendinopathies and partial thickness 
rotator cuff tears usually respond well to conser -
vative treatment which consists of activity modifi -
cation with avoidance of overhead activities, use of 
anti-inflammatory mediations and stretching and 
strengthening of the shoulder and scapular mus -
cles (31). Failure of conservative treatment during 
3 to 6 months or presence of full-thickness rotator 
cuff tears indicates surgical treatment. The surgical 
management includes arthroscopic rotator cuff re -
pair with or without acromioplasty (32).
Superior labrum from anterior to posterior lesions
Although the very first description dates in 1985 
and was given by Andrews et al (33), superior la -
brum from anterior to posterior (SLAP) lesions 
were named and thoroughly described by Sny -
der et al (34). The lesion originates in the area be -
hind the biceps muscle tendon insertion to the 
glenoid labrum and extends anteriorly to half of 
the glenoid (35). The most common etiology is 
a fall or direct blow to the shoulder, although re -
petitive biceps tension from overhead activity in 
water polo players is probably more common eti -
ological factor. Athletes usually present with pain 
and various mechanical symptoms, but so far no 
reliable SLAP-lesion-specific physical examina -
tion tests have been developed to facilitate clin -
ical diagnosis (36). The most accurate imaging 
method is MRI with gadolinium, but the most

shoulder is in the position of abduction and maximal external rotation, 
which may result in the development of internal impingement.

285reliable diagnostic tool still remains arthroscopy 
of the shoulder (37). The treatment depends on 
the stage of the lesion and involves fixation of the 
detached labrum to the glenoid or resection of 
the torn fragment (38).
Thrower’s elbow (elbow pain)
Elbow pain is a common complaint of the water 
polo athletes and it poses a great diagnostic and 
therapeutic challenge because of a unique pathol -
ogy that results from repetitive overhead throw -
ing (39). Various different conditions have been 
attributed to the overhead throwing motion, but 
ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) injuries, valgus 
extension overload syndrome with olecranon os -
teophytes and posteromedial impingement, and 
osteochondritis dissecans of the capitellum are 
the most frequent in water polo (40). The val -
gus forces generated during the cocking and ac -
celeration phases of throwing exceed the intrin -
sic tensile strength of the UCL and microtears 
occur (41). If not treated adequately, additional 
cumulative microtrauma will cause further dam -
age and a complete rupture of the UCL will oc -
cur. Conservative treatment includes a brief peri -
od of rest, use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory 
medications (NSAIDs) and local physical thera -
py modalities (42). Operative treatment should 
be performed in competitive athletes with acute 
complete ruptures of the UCL or chronic symp -
toms due to instability that have not significantly 
improved after at least 3 to 6 months of conser -
vative treatment (43). Posteromedial impinge -
ment is the result of the combination of tensile 
forces medially and shear forces posteriorly (44). 
In most of the cases the athlete can be treated 
conservatively, but if symptoms persist surgical 
intervention is indicated (45). Osteochondritis 
dissecans (OCD) of the elbow is a localized in -
jury or condition affecting an articular surface 
that involves separation of a segment of cartilage 
and subchondral bone of the humeral capitel -
lum (Figure 4) (46). OCD of the elbow is often 
observed in dominant extremity of young ath -letes involved in throwing sports such as baseball, 
handball and water polo. Excessive cyclic loading 
of the radiocapitellar joint due to the repetitive 
valgus stress associated with throwing is thought 
to be the main cause. Symptoms include pain, 
swelling of the joint, and mechanical symptoms 
such as catching or blocking, and the diagnosis is 
confirmed with plain radiographs, computerized 
tomography, and/or MRI. The treatment is ini -
tially conservative with rest and physical therapy. 
Failure of such treatment during 3 to 6 months 
calls for open or arthroscopic surgery (47).
Hand and wrist injuries
Hand and wrist injuries are common in water 
polo players. The wrist functions to position the 
hand in space for gripping and grasping activities. 
This is accomplished by a unique and complex ar -
rangement of bony and ligamentous structures.
Stenosing tenosynovitis (de Quervain’s syn -
drome) of the first dorsal compartment is the 
most common tendinitis of the wrist in the ath -
letes (48). It is the result of repetitive gliding of 
tendons (abductor pollicis longus and exten -
sor pollicis brevis) beneath the sheat of the first 
compartment over the radial syloid. Treatment 
is dictated by stage of the disease. Rest and im -
mobilization in early stages, after corticosteroid 
injection into first dorsal compartment results 
in reported cure rates of 62%, 80%, and 100% 
(49-51). If there is no progress, surgical release of 
the first dorsal compartment may be performed. 
Extensor carpi ulnaris tendinitis is second to de 
Quervain’s in frequency in athletes, but it may 
affect tendons in all dorsal compartments. Treat -
ment of tendinitis involves splinting, rest, non -
steroids, and occasional corticosteroid injection 
in the tendon sheat.
The commonly encountered acute injuries to 
the hand and fingers consist of lacerations, dis -
locations of the interphalangeal and metacarpal-
phalangeal joints, and fractures of the phalangses 
and metacarpal bones (52,53). The web space 
tear associated with forcible abduction of two 
Croat Med J 2007;48:281-288
286adjecant fingers is the most common laceration 
in water polo. Dislocation of the joints of the fin -
gers and hand, usually a dorsal dislocation of the 
proximal interphalageal joint with or without a 
fracture of the middle phalanx is common. The 
mechanism of injury is usually a hyperextension 
of the joint, which occurs when a player tries to 
catch a ball or block a shot (54).
Lower extremity injuries
Groin pain
Groin pain is defined as tendon enthesitis of ad -
ductor longus, iliopsoas, and/or abdominal mus -
cles and can present a diagnostic and treatment 
challenge (55,56). The balance between the ad -
ductors and abdominal muscles is of great im -
portance, as well at the elasticity of pubic symphi -
sis. The weakness of the abdominal muscle wall 
is the most common cause of groin pain. This 
symptom seems to occur frequently in sports in -
volving twisting and turning. History of chron -
ic groin pain that is nonresponsive to treatment 
should raise suspicion of sportsman’s hernia (57). 
Adductor muscle strains are common injury in 
sports that involve sudden changes of direction. 
The onset is acute and the area of pain and ten -
derness is usually well localized, either to the bel -
ly of the adductor longus, the proximal musculo -
tendinous junction or the tendon near its origin 
on the inferior pubic ramus (58). Recurrent ad -ductor muscle strains are common. This may be 
due to inadequate rehabilitation of the initial in -
jury, resuming sport too quickly or not resolving 
associated problems such as lumbar spine stiff -
ness or pelvic imbalance. Adductor tendinopa -
thy causes proximal groin pain, which has a ten -
dency to warm up with increasing activity. If the 
condition remains untreated, the pain tends to 
persist during activity and may migrate either to 
the contralateral groin or to the suprapubic re -
gion. Treatment of groin pain is complex and 
individual, including relative rest, anti-inflam -
matory medications if there is an acute exacerba -
tion, physiotherapy modalities and massage ther -
apy and eccentric strengthening. If conservative 
treatment is not successful, surgery is indicated.
Knee injuries
Swimmers, especially breast strokers, have long 
been complaining of medial knee pain. Kenal re -
ports this percentage to be as high as 73% (59). It 
has been documented that leg work accounts for 
40 to 55% of the game, depending on the posi -
tion played and game tactics. Water polo players 
seldom perform the breaststroke “whip kick, “but 
instead, the right leg rotates counterclockwise 
while the left rotates clockwise in the “eggbeater“ 
kick unique to water polo. The rotation of the 
knee, with compression on the medial aspect of 
the joint, causes degenerative changes (60). Pain 
along or over the origin or insertion of the medi -

287al collateral ligament is typically an overuse syn -
drome from the chronic stress and overuse of the 
eggbeater kick. The treatment should be directed 
to the correction of improper leg work technique 
along with proper warm-up exercises, local appli -
cation of ice, and ultrasound (61).

Ratko Rudić is by far the most successful coach in the history 
of water polo, who, during his long and fruitful career, won 21 
international trophies. He won three consecutive gold Olympic 
medals – Los Angeles 1984 and Seoul 1988 with the national team 
of Yugoslavia, and Barcelona 1992 with Italian national team. He 
also won three gold medals on World championships with three 
different national teams – Madrid 1986 with Yugoslavia, Rome 
1994 with Italy, and Melbourne 2007 with Croatia. He earned his 
last gold medal in 2007 with Croatia in the dramatic final match 
against Hungary at the World Championship in Melbourne, 
Australia. In May 2007, Ratko Rudić was officially introduced to 
the International Swimming Hall of Fame in Fort Lauderdale, 
Florida, USA. Although he is the fifth Croatian awarded with this 
honor, this was the first time in the history of this institution that 
the Croatian flag was lifted.
