Abstract
Activity-based rehabilitation is a promising strategy for improving functional recovery following spinal cord
injury (SCI). While results from both clinical and animal studies have shown that a variety of approaches can beeffective, debate still exists regarding the optimal post-injury period to apply rehabilitation. We recently demon-strated that rats with moderately severe thoracic contusive SCI can be re-trained to swim when training is
initiated 2 weeks after injury and that swim training had no effect on the recovery of overground locomotion. We
concluded that swim training is a task-speciﬁc model of post-SCI activity-based rehabilitation. In the presentstudy, we ask if re-training initiated acutely is more or less effective than when initiated at 2 weeks post-injury.Using the Louisville Swim Scale, an 18-point swimming assessment, supplemented by kinematic assessment ofhindlimb movement during swimming, we report that acute re-training is less effective than training initiated at2 weeks. Using the bioluminescent protein luciferase as a blood-borne macromolecular marker, we also show asigniﬁcant increase in extravasation in and around the site of SCI following only 8 min of swimming at 3 dayspost-injury. Taken together, these results suggest that acute re-training in a rat model of SCI may compromise
rehabilitation efforts via mechanisms that may involve one or more secondary injury cascades, including acute
spinal microvascular dysfunction.

Introduction
One of the most promising therapeutic approaches to
the treatment of spinal cord injury (SCI) is body weight–
supported step training (BWST) (Harkema et al., 1997; Beres-
Jones et al., 2003). BWST is a speciﬁc form of activity-basedrehabilitation that seeks to re-train the spinal cord to generate
functional stepping by exposing it to the speciﬁc pattern of
afferent input associated with stepping, with assistance, ona treadmill. While the majority of clinical studies using
BWST focus on chronic SCI (Pepin et al., 2003; Maegele et al.,
2002; Abel et al., 2002; Gazzani et al., 1999; Felici et al., 1997;Harkema et al., 1997), a number of animal studies suggest that
activity-based rehabilitation strategies may be more effective
when initiated acutely, and that the beneﬁts may go beyondlocomotion to include pain, spasticity, muscle wasting andcardiovascular =respiratory function. For example, signiﬁcant
beneﬁts were found for early ‘‘exercise’’ (Dupont-Versteegdenet al., 2004; Engesser-Cesar et al., 2007), and acute re-training on
a treadmill appears to have signiﬁcant advantages over training
in chronic rodent models (Gomez-Pinella et al., 2001, 2002;Hutchinson et al., 2004). Further, studies utilizing the com-pletely transected cat model also demonstrate enhanced efﬁ-
cacy of rehabilitation initiated within days of injury (Boyce et al.,
2007; Rossignol, 2002; DeLeon et al., 1998). Likewise, Multonet al. (2003) showed that rats that began treadmill training as
early as 2–4 days after a compressive SCI had higher Basso,
Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) scores compared to untrainedanimals. These data collectively support the concept that ini-
tiating training acutely following an incomplete SCI may en-
able activation of spinal circuitry during a period when theperceived plasticity in the system is high.

However, contusive injuries to the brain and spinal cord
involve secondary injury cascades that encompass the acute
and sub-acute post-injury time period and thus may compli-
cate the optimization of the timing of acute rehabilitative in-tervention. For example, in a series of studies using the ﬂuid
percussion model of traumatic brain injury (TBI) Greisbach
et al. (2004a,b, 2007) have shown that voluntary exercisewithin the ﬁrst 7–10 days post-injury may be detrimental to
functional outcome. While these data show that voluntary
exercise can induce increases in growth factor expression andimproved functional outcome, these beneﬁcial effects werecompromised if initiated within the ﬁrst 7–10 days post-
injury. The poor functional outcomes were accompanied by
augmented epicenter histopathology, which the authors sug-gest may be correlated with a compromised blood-brain
barrier. Whether or not similar principles apply to SCI is cur-
rently not known.
Many events occurring over the ﬁrst several days following
a contusive SCI are believed to be crucial to the expandinglesion and secondary injury processes, and are therefore po-tential targets for therapeutic intervention. These include thebreakdown of the blood-spinal cord barrier (BSCB) (Whet-
stone et al., 2003), which allows the inﬁltration of both cellular
and non-cellular inﬂammatory mediators. The temporalcourse of permeability changes to the BSCB following con-
tusive SCI has been demonstrated in the rat by Popovich et al.
(1996). Their data show that permeability at or near the injuryepicenter is maximal at 3 days post-injury and concentrated
within affected gray matter. The breakdown of the BSCB be-
gins to resolve by 7 days, but is still not equivalent to unin-jured spinal cord at 14 days post-injury. More recently, this
temporal course of BSCB compromise and reconstitution has
also been observed following contusive SCI in the mouse(Whetstone et al., 2003). Importantly, this temporal progres-sion of known BSCB instability encompasses the acute and
sub-acute time periods when therapeutic strategies, including
activity-based rehabilitation, could realistically be initiated.
We showed previously that adult female Sprague-Dawley
rats can be re-trained to swim after a moderately severe tho-racic contusion injury, when the animals are re-introduced tothe water at 10 days, and rigorously re-trained (i.e., 6/C2 4-min
swim sessions 4 times per week over 8 weeks). This inter-vention resulted in signiﬁcantly improved swimming as as-sessed by the Louisville Swim Scale (LSS) (Smith et al., 2006b)but did not translate to enhanced recovery of overground
locomotion as assessed by the BBB Open Field Locomotor
Scale (Basso et al., 1995). These observations lead us to con-clude that swim-training, when applied in the sub-acute
phase of SCI recovery, is a task-speciﬁc model of activity-
based rehabilitation, which could be used to investigate post-SCI plasticity, independent of over-ground locomotion.
Common to all activity-based rehabilitation approaches is the
fact that activity (exercise) induces increases in blood ﬂow,heart rate, and respiration rate. How the stresses associated
with physical activity early after SCI alters the cascade of
secondary injury events and the microvasculature surround-ing an injury epicenter is essentially unknown. Thus, the pri-mary goals of the current study were to examine the inﬂuence
of swim-training initiated acutely (3 days) post-injury on
the recovery of swimming and, subsequently, to investigatethe effects of swim-training sessions on the evolving micro-
vascular plasticity in the injured spinal cord.Methods
Experimental overview
The experiments reported were completed in three phases
according to the timelines shown in Figure. 1. The initial ex-
periment (Phase 1) was designed to investigate rehabilitative
effects of acute swim training. A secondary ﬁnding of thisstudy was that the control animals, which were assessed in the
swimming pool twice each week, showed a signiﬁcant im-
provement in swimming over time, suggesting that 8 min ofswimming each week was sufﬁcient to induce a training ef-fect. This question was addressed in Phase 2, where animals
were also trained acutely and assessed weekly; however, an
untrained control group was only assessed terminally (Fig. 1).Finally, based on the ﬁndings of Phases 1 and 2, a third study
(Phase 3) was completed where animals were exposed to 2/C2 4-
min training sessions, or cage rest, at 3 or 14 days post-SCI,
with each animal assessed for overt signs of microvascular
dysfunction (i.e., BSCB permeability).
Pool design and baseline measurements
All the animals were acclimatized to the training pool
1 week before surgery. They were allowed to swim several
laps in the pool each day for 5 consecutive days before sur-
gery. The acclimatization period allowed the uninjured ani-mals to become comfortable with the handler and the pool,
and allowed the trainers to observe whether any pre-injury
deﬁcits were present. The pool is a clear Plexiglas tank 60inches long, 7 inches wide, and 12 inches deep. The pool was
ﬁlled to a depth of 7–8 inches for the training sessions, and the
water temperature was maintained at 25–28 8C. All swim
training for these studies included supplementary cutaneousfeedback, in the form of suspended 1.5-ml centrifuge tubes, as
described previously (Smith et al., 2006a,b). The centrifuge
tubes provided cutaneous feedback to the hindpaws duringthe training session, but offered less than 1.2 g of buoyancy
each. One end of the pool has an exit ramp covered with a
neoprene pad, which allowed the animals to exit the pooleasily, even after injury. Baseline LSS, hindlimb kinematics
during swimming, and BBB Open Field Locomotor scores
were obtained prior to injury (Smith et al., 2006b; Basso et al.,1995).
Spinal cord injury
Twelve young adult female Sprague-Dawley rats (175–
200 g) were used for each of the acute training studies (Phases
1 and 2). The rats were anesthetized with Nembutal
(0.8 cc =100 g, ip) and were given prophylactic antibiotics
(Gentamicin, 15 mg =kg, sc). A single level laminectomy was
performed at the T9 vertebra, and the spine was immobilizedusing clamps applied to the T8 and T10 spinous processes. An
NYU Impactor was used to deliver a 25g-cm contusion injuryat the T9 =10 spinal level. After the injury, the wound was
closed in layers and a topical antibiotic ointment applied tothe incision. The animals were placed on heating pads inclean, single cages overnight, and returned to their regularhousing room the following day. Bladder expression was
performed twice daily until adequate spontaneous voiding
occurred. Once training commenced (3 days post-injury),animals were housed two per cage for the duration of the
study. In Phase 1, two animals were removed based on injury1018 SMITH ET AL.
severity (displacement and=or velocity of impact), and one
animal died after 4 weeks of training, leaving ﬁnal group sizes
of ﬁve (swim-trained) and four (untrained). In Phase 2, one
animal died within 3 days of injury, and two others wereremoved based on injury severity (displacement and =or ve-
locity of impact), leaving ﬁnal group sizes of ﬁve (swim-trained) and four (untrained). An additional 48 young femaleSprague-Dawley rats were used to assess spinal microvas-
cular permeability (Phase 3). All procedures were identical to
those described above, except that the Inﬁnite Horizons Im-pactor was used to deliver a moderate (150-kD) contusioninjury.Phases 1 and 2: Acute post-injury swim training
For the Phase 1 study, the animals in the trained group were
introduced to the pool for 2 /C23-min training sessions beginning
on post-injury day 3 and were assisted by handlers when
necessary. This was increased to 4 /C23-min sessions on days 4
and 5. Starting on day 8, the duration of each session was
increased to 4 min, and by day 11, each animal was training
for 6/C24-min sessions daily, for 4 days each week (Fig. 1).
Untrained animals for this study remained caged (in pairs)
in the swimming room during the training sessions. Un-trained animals were handled daily and received sweetenedday 0 day 3 day 7

FIG. 1. Shown are timelines for all three experiments. In Phase 1, both groups of animals were assessed using the Louisville
Swim Scale (LSS) twice weekly, once with and once without cutaneous feedback. In Phase 2, the trained group was assessed
once weekly, alternating between with and without cutaneous feedback. The control group was assessed only twice, on day
44 with cutaneous feedback and on day 53 without feedback, during which video was made for kinematic assessment.Injuries for Phases 1 and 2 were moderately severe, delivered by the New York University (NYU) Impactor. Injuries for Phase3 were moderate, delivered by the Inﬁnite Horizons (IH) contusion device.ACUTE SWIM TRAINING AFTER SPINAL CORD INJURY 1019
cereal treats, with the trained animals, at the completion of
each training session. This study continued for 6 weeks.
Training for Phase 2 was identical to Phase 1, however, this
study continued for 7 weeks. As with Phase 1, untrained an-imals remained caged (in pairs) in the swimming room during
the training sessions, were handled daily, and received cereal
treats with the trained animals.
Phases 1 and 2: Weekly assessments
The BBB Open Field Locomotor Scale (Basso et al., 1995)
was used to score overground locomotion of all animals on a
weekly basis starting at 1 week post-injury, as previouslydescribed (Smith et al., 2006a,b). In addition, swimming
function was assessed using the LSS (Smith et al., 2006b),
which sensitively quantiﬁes swimming ability of SCI ratsutilizing an 18-point scale with three functional ranges: 0–5
(poor swimmer), 6–11 (intermediate swimmer), and 12–17
(good swimmer). Within the scale, hindlimb movement isassessed as absent (< 5% of the 4-min assessment time), oc-
casional (6–50%), frequent (51–95% of the time), or consistent(>95%). For Phase 1, the trained and untrained animals were
tested weekly both with and without supplemental cutaneousfeedback, making the total testing time 8 min per week. For
Phase 2, the trained animals were assessed weekly (4 min =
week). Testing was conducted with supplemental cutaneous
feedback on weeks 2, 4, and 6 and without feedback on weeks
1, 3, 5, and 7. The untrained animals were not tested at all until
the last 2 weeks of the study. At this point, they were testedwith feedback on week 6 and without on week 7 (Fig. 1).
Phases 1 and 2: Swimming kinematics
One drawback of the LSS is that it scores hindlimb move-
ment and alternation, but does not distinguish between small,
ineffective movements or larger, more effective swimming
strokes. To quantitatively assess swimming movements, ki-
nematic analysis was done of the nine best swimming strokestaken from three different passes (pool lengths) both pre-
injury and at week 5. This analysis represents the best
movements that were produced during the trials, rather thanthose that are consistently produced.
Before injury, each rat was shaved on the left side so that
the iliac crest and hip could be easily palpated. A green tattoowas placed on the skin immediately overlying the iliac crestand greater trochanter of the femur (hip joint) using an Ara-
mis micro-tattoo punch (Braintree Scientiﬁc, Braintree, MA).
Before each ﬁlming session, the animal was shaved and ablack Sharpie pen was used to reinforce the original tattoo
marks on the iliac crest and hip and to place additional marks
on the ankle (lateral malleolus) and toe (metatarsophylangealjoint). Three complete swimming passes (pool lengths) where
the hindlimbs remained vertical were recorded with a high-
speed (60-Hz) Basler camera and saved as AVI ﬁles. Theseﬁles were opened in MaxTraq (Innovation Systems, Co-
lumbiaville, MI), where the iliac crest (I), hip (H), ankle (A),
and toe (T) were marked in a semi-automated fashion on eachframe of the digital video. Each pass was then divided intostrokes based on the peak extension of the hip–ankle–toe
(HAT) angle and an angle-angle plot (iliac crest–hip–ankle
[IHA] vs. HAT) was constructed for each stroke. An angle-angle plot of a normal stroke forms an ellipse, with the area
representing the out-of-phase excursions of the proximal anddistal angles and the center of the ellipse (the centroid) re-
presenting the mean of each angle taken from all the points
used to create the plot. The area and centroid of each ellipse
was calculated using an Elliptical Fourier Analysis freewareapplication (Ferson et al., 1985). Thus, each stroke was ob-
jectively characterized using the ellipse area and the x- and
y-values of the centroid. If the animals were unable to kick, the
IHA=HAT values were broken into virtual strokes of 15
frames each and analyzed in the same way.
Phases 1 and 2: Histologic assessment
After the terminal assessments, the animals were eutha-
nized with an excess of anesthetic (Nembutal, 0.3 cc, ip) and
perfused transcardially with calcium-free tyrodes and 4%
paraformaldehyde. The spinal cords were removed and post-ﬁxed overnight followed by cryoprotection in 30% sucrose.
Once the tissue was cryoprotected, a 6-mm segment of spinal
cord containing the epicenter was blocked in the transverseplane, placed in molds with cutting media, frozen on dry ice
and stored at /C0808C. Spinal cord tissue was cut transversely at
30mm and mounted onto gelatinized glass slides. One set of
slides was stained with Eriochrome Cyanin (Scheff et al., 2003)
to enable the determination of spared white matter at the
injury epicenter. Digitized images of stained sections were
captured using a Spot camera (Diagnostic Instruments, Ster-ling Heights, MI) connected to a Nikon Eclipse E400 micro-
scope. The images were opened in Appleworks 6.0, and the
sections were traced using a Wacom Intuos drawing tablet(Vancouver, WA) and saved as uncompressed TIF ﬁles. Each
TIF ﬁle was opened in Image J, and the area of the gray and
white matter was calculated. The injured white matter area foreach epicenter was converted to a spared white matter per-centage using a mean uninjured thoracic white matter area
calculation as the denominator.
Phase 3: Assessment of microvascular dysfuction
In this experiment, we examined the extravasation of the
macromolecule luciferase into parenchyma of the spinal cord
as a quantitative marker of BSCB dysfunction (Whetstoneet al., 2003). This was done using uninjured control and SCI
animals subjected to 2 /C24-min swimming sessions (75 min
apart) compared to cage-rested controls. We used six groups
of six animals to compare uninjured controls with 3-day and14-day post-injury time points. Immediately before each
swimming session, 250 ml of luciferase (1 mg =ml; Promega,
Madison, WI) was administered intravenously via the lateral
tail vein. Animals in the swim-trained group received 4 min of
training starting 15 min after luciferase administration (Fig. 1).
After the second and ﬁnal swimming session, the animalswere returned to their home cages for an additional 15 min
prior to being euthanized with an excess of Nembutal (0.3 cc,
i.p.) and perfused transcardially with 250 ml of 10mM phos-phate-buffered saline (PBS). Un-trained rats received lucifer-
ase but remained in their home cages, singly housed. Three
4-mm segments of spinal cord tissue, one centered on the
injury epicenter
and adjacent rostal =caudal segments, were
rapidly removed, weighed, and homogenized in 250 mlo f
luciferase lysis buffer (Promega). As an intra-animal tissuecontrol, a 4-mm segment was blocked from the mid-cervicalspinal cord (i.e., uninjured tissue). Samples were ﬂash-frozen
on dry ice and stored at /C0808C until analysis. Luciferase ac-1020 SMITH ET AL.
tivity in each experimental sample was determined using the
Promega Luciferase Assay kit (no. E1501) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. Reacted samples were read on a
Orion microplate luminometer with Simplicity 4.0 software(Berthold Detection Systems, Oak Ridge, TN). All samples
were analyzed in triplicate, independently replicated, and
normalized to wet-weight.
Statistical analysis
Behavioral data (BBB, LSS, and kinematics) and quantita-
tive permeability data were analyzed using a repeated-
measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by a Tukey
HSD post-hoc t-test to correct for small sample size and un-
equal variance among groups. Spared white matter data wereanalyzed using a two-tailed independent t-test for equal or
unequal variance as appropriate (Hays, 1981).
Results
Over-ground locomotion
Animals in both the Phase 1 and 2 training studies were
assessed weekly for changes in over-ground locomotion using
the BBB Open Field Locomotor Scale (Basso et al.,1995). The
mean terminal BBB scores for all the groups ranged from 9.2 to
10.6, indicating that the animals recovered weight supportat stance and occasional weight-supported plantar stepping
with a lack of forelimb=hindlimb coordination. The mean BBB
scores for the trained and untrained groups in the Phase 2study were found to be statistically different, with the swim-trained animals displaying slightly poorer overground step-
ping as compared to the untrained group (Table 1).
Spared white matter
The spared white matter at the injury epicenter is shown as
a percent of uninjured tissue in Table 1. No group differences
were found. For comparison purposes, the mean spared white
matter from our previously published ‘‘standard’’ study is
also shown. Note that the spared white matter was assessedusing cresyl violet stain in the standard study and eriochrome
cyanin in the current studies.
Swimming
Phase 1: Acute training study. Pre-injury, all the animals
in the Phase 1 study swam normally with LSS scores of 17.Post-injury assessments were done with supplemental cuta-
neous feedback in the morning (Fig. 2A), and then without
supplemental cutaneous feedback in the afternoon, 2 h later
(Fig. 2B). At the ﬁrst post-injury LSS assessment on day 7, after4 days of swim training, both trained and untrained groups
were assessed for 4 min, or as long as they could safely swim.
At this time point, none of the animals moved their hindlimbs,and all had severe trunk rotation and= or severe body angle,
illustrating that 4 days of swim training with supplementalcutaneous feedback, initiated at 3 days post-injury, had noinﬂuence on swimming (Fig. 2). However, after this timepoint, both groups showed improved LSS scores over time.
There were no differences in LSS scores between the two
groups at any time point, and only one animal recoveredeither occasional (6–50%) or frequent (51–95%) hindlimb
movement. It was a trained animal that scored 3 on day 7 and
scored 11 on day 42. These ﬁndings are in contrast to ourpreviously published study (standard study), wherein ani-
mals that were swim trained with or without cutaneous
feedback starting at 2 weeks post-injury scored signiﬁcantlybetter than untrained animals that were assessed weekly(Smith et al., 2006a). All the trained animals in the standard
study recovered at least occasional hindlimb movement. For
comparison, Figure 2 shows the 42-day LSS scores for groupsfrom the standard study that were trained with (A) or without
(B) cutaneous feedback.
Kinematic analysis was done to quantitatively describe
hindlimb movement during swimming based on the excur-sions of the HAT and IHA angles. Figure 3A shows an angle-
angle plot (HAT vs. IHA) from one baseline stroke, as anexample. The area of the ellipse represents the out-of-phase
excursion of the two angles, and the centroid represents the
mean position of the limb throughout the stroke cycle. Forexample, Figure 3B also shows a stroke produced by an un-trained animal that had a very extended ankle (x ¼166), but
that still managed to generate a fairly large stroke with anangle-angle plot area of 28.
Figure 3C shows that the mean angle-angle plot area was
signiﬁcantly reduced at 5 weeks in the swim-trained groupas compared to baseline, but not for the untrained group. Thisreﬂects the fact that three out of four of the untrained animals
recovered the ability to generate strokes with large angular
excursions, compared to only one out of ﬁve of the trainedanimals. In addition, it suggests that only 8 min of swimmingper week is sufﬁcient to bring about some functional recovery

of hindlimb movement, including occasional swimming
strokes that have a large excursion and are relatively effective.
Figure 3D, showing the mean angle-angle plot centroids, in-dicates that both trained and untrained groups had a moreextended mean limb position while swimming, and the sig-
niﬁcant x-shift illustrates that the distal limb segment (knee
and ankle) were responsible for this difference. The large
amount of variability, in particular in the HAT angle, shows
that some animals swam with somewhat ﬂexed ankles and
others with ankles that were very extended (Fig. 3B), whilelimb position during swimming was not positively inﬂuenced
by acute training.
Phase 2: Swim training and LSS assessments. In the
Phase 2 study, the LSS scores of the trained animals did not
show statistically signiﬁcant improvements over time(p¼0.102; Fig. 4). This is in part because only one of the ﬁvetrained animals recovered occasional to frequent hindlimbmovement by post-injury day 30, resulting in high statistical
variability for the group. This hindlimb movement was ob-
served only when the animal was assessed with cutaneousfeedback. None of the animals recovered even occasional hind-
limb movement when assessed without cutaneous feedback
(Fig. 4). Surprisingly, three out of four of the untrained ani-mals, which were not assessed until post-injury day 44, ex-
hibited frequent to consistent hindlimb movement (LSS ¼12)
and the fourth exhibited occasional hindlimb movement (5–
50%; LSS ¼8). The mean score of 11 is signiﬁcantly higher
than the mean (6.2) of the trained group ( p<0.05). Interest-
ingly, the terminal (day 44) LSS score for the untrained groupwas 11.0 /C62.0 (n¼5) when assessed with cutaneous feed-
back, which is similar to the 6-week score for the trained
group from our published ‘‘standard’’ study (11.3 /C62.3,n¼8),
where training was initiated at 2 weeks post-injury.
Terminal kinematic analysis also showed that here were no
differences between the trained and untrained groups (Fig.
4B,C). Three animals in each group were able to generatesome kicks with substantial joint excursions resulting in largegroup standard deviations even if they could not achieve even
occasional to frequent hindlimb movements during the 4-min
LSS scoring session (LSS <6). Figure. 4C shows that the two
groups also had similar mean limb positions as illustrated by
the angle-angle plot centroid.
Phase 3: Augmentation of BSCB dysfunction by acute
swim training. As shown in Figure 5A, we found that only
8 min of swim training at 3 days post-injury induced a sig-
niﬁcant increase in luciferase content in spinal cord segments3 and 4, representing 0–4 mm on either side of the injuryepicenter, compared to the untrained animals ( p<0.01).
Interestingly, segments 2 and 5, representing spinal cord 4–8 mm from the epicenter, also had much higher levels ofluciferase; however, these values were not statistically sig-
niﬁcant. Uninjured control animals demonstrated extremely
low levels of luciferase extravasation, whether or not theywere exposed to 8 min of swimming (data not shown). By
14 days post-injury, there were no differences in extravasated
luciferase between swim-trained and untrained animals.
Discussion
The goal of the present study was to use our swimming
model of activity-based rehabilitation (Smith et al., 2006a) to
investigate if re-training applied acutely after a moderatelysevere thoracic SCI is more or less effective than re-training
initiated at 2 weeks post-injury. At 3 days post-injury, most
animals have largely recovered from the surgical trauma, butfew have begun moving their hindlimbs (Multon et al., 2004);
thus, it represents a feasible, acute time point to initiate
training. We began with daily 2/C2 3-min training sessions and
increased the number and duration of the sessions until each
animal was completing 6/C2 4-min sessions daily starting on
day 11 (Fig. 1). This is comparable to the 20–30-min daily
training regimes used by a number of other groups that haveinitiated training acutely (Fouad et al., 2000; Hutchinson et al.,
2004; Multon et al., 2004). Given that both the trained and
untrained groups in the Phase 1 study showed modest im-provements in swimming over time (as assessed by the LSS;
Fig. 2), our approach in the Phase 2 study was to compare0246810121416

trained animals with a control group that was not assessed or
exposed to the activity of swimming until the terminal time
point. Both these approaches have drawbacks. The ﬁrst ap-pears to involve a ‘‘training effect’’ where 8 min of swimmingeach week, during the assessment of the untrained group,
leads to a modest improvement in LSS scores equivalent to
trained animals (Smith et al., 2006a), and the second approachinvolved assessing animals at 6 and 7 weeks post-injury
where the behavior being assessed was novel (swimming af-
ter SCI) and the animals had not been acclimated to the ap-paratus or activity post-injury.In Phase 1, both trained and untrained groups showed a
modest but statistically signiﬁcant improvement in LSS scoreover time, but no group differences were found. The meanterminal LSS score was 6, illustrating that few animals de-veloped even occasional hindlimb movement. In contrast to
our earlier results (Smith et al., 2006a) where trained animals
recovered frequent hindlimb movement (LSS score of 11), thecurrent study indicates that daily swim training starting at
3 days is no more effective than 2/C2 4-min swimming sessions
each week and that both approaches are less effective than
daily swim training initiated at 2 weeks post-injury.hip - ankle - toe (HAT) angleiliac crest - hip - ankle (IHA) angle75100125150175200225

were found to be not different from baseline (mean /C6SD). (D) The mean centroids for the angle-angle plots from both trained

In Phase 2, the trained group did not show signiﬁcant im-
provements in LSS score over time; however, in agreement
with the Phase 1 study, this group did achieve a score of 6
when assessed with cutaneous feedback. It is interesting to
note that the mean BBB overground locomotor score for thetrained group was lower, statistically, than the mean score forthe untrained group. The difference in the scores was slight(1.3) but indicates that, on average, the trained animals did
not achieve weight-supported stepping lacking coordination
while the untrained animals did. Somewhat unexpectedly, the0246810121416

scores when assessed with or without supplementary cutaneous feedback, respectively. The open circle and triangle show the
scores for the untrained group that were assessed only twice, at 44 days with supplementary cutaneous feedback and at

neous feedback than without (mean /C6SD, ^, paired t-test, p<0.01). (B,C ) Shown are the angle-angle plot areas and centroids,

untrained group in the Phase 2 study had a mean LSS score of
11 when ﬁrst assessed on post-injury day 44, signiﬁcantly
better than the mean of 6 for the trained group and equivalentto the trained group from our standard study (Fig. 4). The
untrained group also had a slightly higher (but not statisti-
cally signiﬁcant) spared white matter (13.6% compared to11.5%; Table 1). While it is unlikely that a 2% increase in meanspared white matter at the injury epicenter could account for
all of these changes, it may be a contributing factor. The LSS
score of 11 indicates that these animals recovered frequenthindlimb movement despite having no exposure to the ac-
tivity of swimming until post-injury day 44. This observation
suggests that acute post-injury exposure to the novel, butnormal locomotor activity of swimming may in some way
negatively alter the plasticity of the neural circuitry involved
in swimming compared to cage rest or training initiated at2 weeks post-injury. The untrained group scored signiﬁcantly
lower (LSS ¼6; Fig. 4) when assessed without cutaneous
feedback suggesting that supplementary cutaneous feedbackmay be more effective at encouraging hindlimb movement in
animals that are untrained and= or that are not exposed to
swimming with feedback until after post-injury week 2.
Swimming kinematics cannot be accurately assessed when
supplemental cutaneous feedback is being used, so all the
kinematic assessments were done without cutaneous feed-
back. These analyses conﬁrmed that the trained groups inboth Phase 1 and 2 studies had signiﬁcant deﬁcits in hindlimb
excursion after SCI, and that swim training initiated at 3 days
was not able to bring about signiﬁcant improvements whencompared to the untrained groups (Figs. 3 and 4). Even in theabsence of supplementary cutaneous feedback, as a group the
untrained animals had larger, more effective kicks as shown
by greater out-of-phase angular excursions. Assessment of theangle-angle plot centroid, which represents the mean hind-
limb position, shows that acute swim training did not have a
positive effect on limb position (Figs. 3D and 4C), which wasnot signiﬁcantly different from the untrained groups.
As an initial effort to explore potential causes for the lack of
effectiveness of acute swim re-training, we utilized an inertmacromolecule, luciferase, as a surrogate to quantify theleakage of macromolecules from the blood stream into the
parenchyma of the spinal cord. While a variety of surrogate
markers have been used to examine the BSCB, includingradiolabeled AIB (Popovich et al., 2006) and Evans Blue
(Kaptanoglu et al., 2004; Benton et al., 2008), a study by
Whetstone et al. (2003) demonstrated beautifully in the mousethat luciferase can be used to document the temporal changes
in the BSCB following a standard thoracic moderately severe
contusion injury. Their data shows that, in addition to therapid and dramatic increase in luciferase extravasation at 24 h
post-injury, a second peak of permeability can be observed
during the 3–7-day period that includes not only the injuryepicenter but also extends rostrocaudally for up to 6 mm(Whetstone et al., 2003). All their assessments were in cage-
rested animals. Our data shows that only 8 min of swim ex-
ercise at 3 days post-injury is sufﬁcient to induce a signiﬁcantincrease in extravasated luciferase in the spinal cord, on either
side of the injury epicenter, compared to similar segments
taken from animals that were returned to their cages withoutexercise after receiving the intravenous injections of lucifer-
ase. The 0–4-mm segments (i.e., those immediately adjacent to
the injury epicenter) showed the greatest increases in lucif-erase, while the rostral and caudal segments 4–8 mm from theepicenter showed substantial increases that were not statisti-
cally signiﬁcant because of variability. Interestingly, huge
differences in luciferase activity were also seen when com-paring swim exercise at 3 and 14 days post-injury, suggesting
that the BSCB had largely recovered by that time (Popovich
et al., 2006), or that swimming at 14 days was less effective atbringing about an increase in blood pressure and =or ﬂow.
When uninjured rats received 8 min of swim exercise thelevels of luciferase were undetectable. It is important to notethat the swimming sessions essentially exhausted the animals.
While scheduled for 4 min each, many of the 3-day animals
were not able to complete the sessions without signiﬁcantassistance. Nonetheless, the activity was brief and the animalsappeared to completely recover from each session within a
few minutes, and returned to grooming or sleeping soon after
being placed back in their home cages.

motion (mobility), activity-based rehabilitation approaches05001000150020002500

FIG. 5. Shown are the results for the luciferase assay of
spinal cord tissue taken from injured rats after 8 min of
swimming at 3 or 14 days post-injury. Segments of spinalcord (4 mm long) taken from the cervical enlargement (1)
were compared to segments taken from just rostral and
caudal to the injury epicenter. (A ) Segments 3 and 4 taken
from the animal that swam for 8 min at 3 days post-injuryhad signiﬁcantly higher levels of luciferase activity than sim-
ilar segments taken from cage-rested controls (mean /C6SD,
p<0.05). (B ) By 14 days post-injury, the levels of luciferase
activity were signiﬁcantly lower and were similar in cage-rested and animals exposed to 8 min of swimming (note scale
differences of the y-axis in B; mean /C6SD,p<0.05). Luciferase
activity was below detectable limits in uninjured controlanimals whether or not they were exposed to 8 min of
swimming.ACUTE SWIM TRAINING AFTER SPINAL CORD INJURY 1025
have also been shown to inﬂuence a number of systems, in-
cluding pain (Hutchinson et al., 2004), bone and muscle
wasting (de Bruin et al., 1999; Giagregoria et al., 2005; Liu et al.,
2008), spasticity (Fung et al., 1990), and cardiovascular =
respiratory function (Ditor et al., 2005). Thought to be
common to all these studies is the involvement, either
directly or indirectly, of trophic and =or growth factors,
which respond to activity and exercise in both intact ani-
mals and during post-injury rehabilitation (Gomez-Pinilla
et al., 2002). However, increases in physical activity (ex-ercise) require variable increases in heart rate and bloodﬂow, depending on the level of activity. When initiated
acutely, these increases occur at a time when the blood-
brain barrier =BSCB is compromised (Popovich et al., 1997),
potentially leading to exacerbation of inﬂammatory pro-
cesses in and around the injury site (Griesbach et al., 2004).
Thus, while activity-based therapeutic approaches initiatedacutely may beneﬁt functional recovery via growth factor
production and other sources of neural plasticity, they may
be detrimental to functional recovery due to exacerbationof the acute-phase inﬂammatory processes. Importantly, ithas been demonstrated that the temporal aspects of the
inﬂammatory cascade following contusive spinal cord in-
juries in the human population are fairly similar to thosedescribed in animal models (Fleming et al., 2006).
Previous studies that have utilized acute re-training strat-
egies following incomplete spinal cord injuries have relied ontreadmill step training (Fouad et al., 2000; Multon et al., 2004)
and assessments of overground stepping as primary outcome
measures. While Fouad et al. (2000) reported no improve-ments in overground stepping, grid-walking, or narrow-
beam walking in animals with dorsal hemisections, Multon
et al. (2004) reported modest improvements in stepping withtraining following thoracic contusion injuries. While tread-mill training involves some handling and stress for the ani-
mals, these authors make no comment about the activity
being physically tiring for the animals. It remains to be de-termined what levels of physical activity or exercise may
be counter-productive during the acute and sub-acute post-
injury time points and whether or not the detrimental inﬂu-ence is directly related to exercise-induced increases in heart
rate and blood ﬂow or if the release of stress-related com-
pounds may also play a role.
In summary, these studies demonstrate that swim training,
initiated at 3 days post-SCI is less effective at bringing about
task speciﬁc improvements in swimming than when training
is initiated at 2 weeks. Furthermore, our data suggest thatswimming, and perhaps any ‘‘forced exercise’’ that can sig-
niﬁcantly increase the cardiovascular output at acute or
sub-acute post-SCI time points, can bring about increasedextravasation of macromolecules into the spinal cord paren-
chyma, potentially altering the progression of the secondary
injury. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst demonstration ofactivity-dependent microvascular dysfunction following
traumatic SCI. Further, these ﬁndings imply that secondary
injury cascades may be directly inﬂuenced by even shortevents leading to increases in blood pressure during the acuteand sub-acute time periods. Events that lead to even short-
lived peaks in cardiac output, as might be expected during
routine treatment and the initialization of rehabilitation ef-forts, could have long-term negative consequences on func-
tional outcome.Acknowledgments
