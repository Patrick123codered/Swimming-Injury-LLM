ABSTRACT   
Functional Movement Screen® (FMS®) allows to assess athlete’s movement functionality. Movement funcionality in 
young elite and non -elite swimmers may predict future performance. The purpose of this study is to compare FMS® 
scores between young elite and non -elite swimmers, and to verify their relationship with 100m freestyle performance. 
Thirty -two elite swimmers (age: 14.99 ± 0.13 years old; height: 1.71 ± 0.02 m; body mass: 61.28 ± 1.27 kg; 
Fédération Internationale de Natation [FINA] points: 651.59 ± 6.44) and 17 non -elite swimmers (age: 14.65 ± 0.19 
years old; height: 165.12 ± 2 .03 cm; body mass: 57.22 ± 2.43 kg; FINA points: 405.71 ± 21.41) volunteered to 
participate in this cross -sectional study. Individual -test FMS® scores, FMS® composite score and FINA points were 
considered for analysis.  Elite swimmers achieved higher Deep S quat ( p = 0.005; ES = 0.99), Right Hurdle Step ( p = 
0.005; ES = 0.99), Left Hurdle Step ( p = 0.002; ES = 1.08), Trunk Stability Push Up ( p < 0.001; ES = 1.44) and 
FMS® composite ( p < 0.001; ES = 1.35) scores compared to non -elite swimmers. FMS® composite s cores were 
positively related with 100m freestyle performance (r = 0.596, r2 = 40.9%, p < 0.001).  Young non -elite swimmers 
reveal functional deficits in tasks involving mobility of the hips,  knees and ankles, and stabilization of the core and 
spine. Higher movement functionality is positively related with 100m freestyle performance. Swimming coaches 
should consider these deficits and their relationship with performance to differentiate exerci se prescription between 
this populations.

Functional Movement Screen® and performance in swimming

INTRODU CTION  
 
Functional Movement Screen® (FMS®) test battery 
has been proposed as a reliable instrument to assess 
athletes’ functional movement patterns in daily sports 
practice (Kraus et al, 2014; Grible et al, 2013, Onate 
et al., 2012; Teyhen et al., 2012, Minick et al., 2010). 
Moreover, despite controversial evidence (Mokka, 
Sprague, & Gatens, 2016), FMS® composite scores 
under 14 points have been suggested as a cut -off point 
to predict musculoskeletal injury r isk among athletes 
(Chorba et al., 2010; Kiesel, Plisky, & Voight, 2007; 
O`Connor et al., 2011). FMS® comprises 7 
fundamental movement patterns that require mobility, 
neuromuscular control, balance, and stability. To 
evaluate movement functionality, athlet es are assessed 
on a scale from 0 to 3, in which 0 denotes experienced 
pain and 3 indicates that the movement was completed 
without any compensation (Cook et al., 2014a). The 
highest total score that can be attained on the FMS® is 
twenty -one points(Cook et  al., 2014b). Even though 
the FMS® test battery has been used by sports 
professionals to assess functional movement patterns 
in several sports (Anderson, Nrumann, & Bliven, 
2015, Marques et al., 2017; Kuzuhara, et al, 2018; 
Kiesel,  Plisky, & Butler, 2011; Nicolazakes et al., 
2017), only a few applied it to swimmers (Bond et al., 
2015; Gunay, et al., 2017, Bullock et al, 2017).  
Swimming is a sport that involves closed and 
continuous motor skills (Duarte -Mendes et al, 2019) 
and the performance can be influenc ed by several 
factors such as physiological, biomechanical, and 
anthropometric characteristics (Okada, Huxel, & 
Nesser, 2011). The relationship between physical 
characteristics and sprint swimming performance in 
young swimmers has been studied (Connaboy, e t al., 
2015; Geladas, Nassis, & Pavlicevics, 2005; Garrido 
et al, 2012). Ankle, knees, hip, and shoulder mobility 
have been referred to as key kinematic determinants of 
undulatory underwater swimming at maximal velocity 
(Connaboy, et al., 2015). Interestin gly, ankle and 
shoulder mobility were not related to swimming 
performance in male swimmers, whereas shoulder 
mobility was significantly related to 100m freestyle 
performance in female swimmers (Geladas, Nassis, & 
Pavlicevics, 2005). To aid scientific resea rch on this 
topic, the relationship between FMS® scores and 
young swimmers’ performance has been analyzed (Bond et al., 2015; Gunay, et al., 2017). Despite the 
few studies, higher FMS® composite scores have been 
positively related to 100m freestyle perform ance in 
youth swimmers (Bond et al., 2015), while 200m 
individual medley performance does not seem to be 
related to FMS® composite scores in youth swimmers 
(Gunay, et al., 2017). However, given that in freestyle 
races any swimming stroke may be used ( FINA rules, 
2017) , this technique may be more representative of 
swimmers’ functional movement patterns. Further, the 
100m freestyle long course event is the key distance in 
competitive swimming and has been on every 
Olympic program since 1904 (men) and 1912 
(women) (Post et al., 2020).  
To the best of our knowledge, there are no studies 
comparing FMS® scores in elite and non -elite 
swimmers, specifically at young ages (under eighteen 
years old). In fact, swimming performance from a 
young age is highly valued and considered as a strong 
predictor of success (KNZB, 2020). Assessing the 
physical skills of young swimmers is important for 
coaches, sports professionals and swimmers (Bond et 
al., 2015). This knowledge could be relevant for 
swimming coaches, being able  to effectively manage 
young elite and non -elite swimmers’ movement 
functionality according to their specific needs, 
maximizing performance. Thus, the aim of the current 
study was to assess and compare FMS® scores 
between young elite and non -elite swimmers , as well 
as to verify their relationship with 100m freestyle 
performance. It was hypothesized that elite swimmers 
would have higher FMS® scores compared to non -elite 
swimmers. A secondary hypothesis was that FMS® 
composite scores would be positively corre lated to 
100m freestyle performance.  
 
MATERIAL Y MÉTODOS  
Participants   
In this quantitative study with a cross -sectional design , 
thirty -two elite swimmers (age: 14.99 ± 0.13 years old; 
height: 1.71 ± 0.02 m; body mass: 61.28 ± 1.27 kg; 
Fédération Internati onale de Natation [FINA] points: 
651.59 ± 6.44) and 17 non -elite swimmers (age: 14.65 
± 0.19 years old; height: 165.12 ± 2.03 cm; body mass: 
57.22 ± 2.43 kg; FINA points: 405.71 ± 21.41) 
volunteered to participate in this cross -sectional study.

members of the Portuguese National Swimming Team 
and non -elite swimmers were considered those who 
competed at a national level. All subjects were free of 
any functional limitation that would preclude them to 
perform the e xperimental protocol and had at least one 
year of experience in swimming competitions. 
Subjects were excluded if they reported any 
musculoskeletal injury in the last year. All subjects 
and their parents were informed beforehand about the 
benefits, risks, p urposes, and procedures of the study 
and gave their written consent. The current study was 
conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki 
and the protocol was fully approved by the 
Institutional research ethics committee of the 
University of Beira Inte rior (CE -UBI-Pj-2018 -
051:M7247).  
Structured protocol and d ata collection  
The evaluation was conducted on two different days, 
one for each group. Before the FMS® assessment, each 
subject’s age, height, and body mass were collected. 
FINA points were calculated after inquiring the 
participants’ coach about each athlete’s 100m 
freestyle best swim time. All subjects performed the 7 -
test battery FMS®, receiving standar dized verbal 
instructions . 
Measures  
Functional Movement Screen® 
FMS® comprises 7 tests performed in the following 
order: Deep Squat (assessing hips, knees and ankles 
mobility), Hurdle Step (assessing proper stride 
mechanics during a stepping motion), Inlin e Lunge  
(assessing hip and ankle mobility and stability, 
quadriceps flexibility, and knee stability), Shoulder 
Mobility (assessing bilateral and reciprocal shoulder 
range of motion, scapular mobility, and thoracic spine 
extension), Active Straight Leg Rais e (assessing 
active hamstring and gastro‐soleus flexibility while 
maintaining a stable pelvis and core), Trunk Stability 
Push Up (assessing stabilization of the core and spine 
in an anterior and posterior plane during a closed‐
chain upper body movement) an d Rotary Stability 
(assessing neuromuscular coordination and energy 
transfer from one segment of the body to another 
through the torso) (Cook et al., 2014a,b). Athletes 
were assessed by two experienced raters using the 
FMS® test battery. The 7 tests were a ssessed on a scale of 0 to 3 according to the following criteria: 0 - 
experienced pain during the testing; 1 - unable to 
complete the movement pattern or unable to assume 
the position to perform the movement; 2 - able to 
complete the movement with compensa tions; 3 - 
performs the movement correctly without any 
compensation, complying with standard movement 
expectations associated with each test (Cook et al., 
2014b). Except for the Deep Squat and Trunk Stability 
Push Up tests, each side of the body was assess ed 
unilaterally, considering only the side with the lowest 
score. Subjects performed three trials of each 
movement, and the highest score was considered for 
analysis (Cook et al., 2014a). After the test battery was 
performed, both raters verified agreement  of the given 
scores for each test. If there was disagreement in any 
scored test, the subject was asked to repeat the given 
movement. Composite scores were calculated by 
summing each individual -test score (Cook et al., 
2014a).  
Measures of Swimming P erformance 
Swimming performance was assessed using the FINA 
points system which allows comparisons of 
performances regardless of technique or distance 
swam (FINA, 2011). To that end, the participant’s 
coach provided information regarding each athlete's 
100m freestyle personal best swim time.  Then, each 
time was converted to FINA points, a standard 
measure of international swimming performance 
where 1000 points represents the average of the top 10 
all-time results in each event.  
Statistical analysis  
Descriptive statistics (mean ± standard deviation) 
were performed for age, height, bodyweight, FINA 
points, FMS® individual -test scores, and FMS® 
composite scores. Data normality was tested using the 
Kolmogorov -Smirnov and Shapiro -Wilk tests for the 
elite and non -elite groups, respectively.  Therefore, 
FMS® composite scores ( p = 0.19 vs. p = 0.652 for the 
elite and non -elite group, respectively) were analyzed 
using a Student’s T -test, whereas FMS® individual -
test scores ( p < 0.05 for all tests) were analyze d using 
a Mann -Whitney U test. When analyzing the overall 
sample, a Kolmogorov Smirnov test was used to test 
for distribution normality of FMS® composite score 
and FINA points variables ( p = 0.012 vs p = 0.000, 
respectively). Spearman’s rank correlation co efficient

(r) and coefficient of determination (r2) were used to 
verify correlations between FINA points and FMS® 
composite scores. The strength of the relationship was 
classified as follows (Mukaka, 2012): very high (0.90 
< r < 1.00); high (0.70 < r < 0.9 0); moderate (0.50 < r 
< 0.70); low (0.30 < r < 0.50); little (0.10 < r < 0.30). 
Furthermore, the magnitude of effects was classified 
as follows (Lakens, 2013): small (ES = 0.2); moderate 
(ES = 0.5); large (ES = 0.8). The statistical analysis was performed  using SPSS software (IBM Corp. 
Released in 2017. IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, 
Version 25.0. Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.) and the 
significance level was set at p < 0.05.

Table II presents the values of FMS® individual -test 
scores and FMS® composite scores, as well as 
differences between group analysis. Differences were 
found between elite and non -elite groups on the Deep 
Squat ( p = 0.005; ES = 0.99, large effect), Right 
Hurdle Step ( p = 0.005; ES = 0.99, lar ge effect), Left 
Hurdle Step ( p = 0.002; ES = 1.08, large effect) and 
Trunk Push Up ( p < 0.001 ; ES = 1.4, large effect) tests. 
Although there were no statistically significant 
differences between groups on the Left Rotary 
Stability, the effect size indicat es a moderate effect ( p 
= 0.114; ES = 0.52). The elite group achieved higher 
scores for all tests, except for the Left Shoulder 
Mobility. However, no statistical differences were 
found in the aforementioned test ( p = 0.472; ES = 0.2). 
The elite group FMS® composite scores were 
significantly higher ( p < 0.001 ; ES = 1.35, large effect) 
compared to the non -elite group.  
There was a positive and moderate relationship (r = 
0.596, r2 = 40.9%, p < 0.001 ) between FMS® 
composite scores and 100m freestyle performance 
(FINA points) (Figure 1).  DISCUSIÓN  
The purpose of the current study was to assess and 
compare FMS® scores in young elite and non -elite 
swimmers and to verify their relationship with 100m 
freestyle performa nce. The main findings of the 
present study were: (i) young elite swimmers achieved 
significantly higher Deep Squat, Left Hurdle Step, 
Right Hurdle Step, Trunk Stability Push Up and FMS® 
composite scores compared to young non -elite 
swimmers; (ii) FMS® comp osite scores were 
positively correlated with 100m freestyle 
performance.  
FMS® has been used to assess functional movement 
patterns in several sports (Anderson, Nrumann, & 
Bliven, 2015, Marques et al., 2017; Kuzuhara, et al, 
2018;  Kiesel, Plisky, & Butler, 2011; Nicolazakes et 
al., 2017). However, only a few applied FMS® to 
swimmers (Bond et al., 2015; Gunay, et al., 2017, 
Bullock et al, 2017) and no studies have compared 
FMS® scores between young elite and non -elite 
swimmers.

Functional Movement Screen® and performance in swimming  
 
 169 
In the present study, the elite group achieved 
significantly higher Deep Squat, Left Hurdle Step, 
Right Hurdle Step, Trunk Stability Push Up and FMS® 
composite scores than the non -elite group. These 
results suggest that young non -elite swimmers may 
have relevant functional deficits in ta sks involving 
mobility of the hips, knees and ankles (Deep Squat 
test), proper stride mechanics during a stepping 
motion (Hurdle Step test), and also stabilization of the 
core and spine in an anterior and posterior plane during 
a closed‐chain upper body mo vement (Trunk Stability 
Push Up test). Future studies aiming to identify or 
differentiate movement functionality deficits in young 
elite and non -elite swimmers are needed. This would 
allow swimming coaches to provide training programs 
according to swimmers ’ specific needs in an early 
stage of their careers, which has been suggested to 
predict future competitive success (Post et al., 2020).  
Interestingly, even though we have not found 
significant differences between young elite and non -
elite swimmers in the Shoulder Mobility test, the non -
elite group achieved higher scores on Left Shoulder 
Mobility test. The Shoulder Mobility test assesses 
bilateral and reciprocal shoulder range of motion, 
combining internal rotation with adduction of one 
shoulder and externa l rotation with the abduction of 
the other. The test also requires normal scapular 
mobility and thoracic spine extension (Cook et al., 
2014b). It is widely agreed that swimming injuries are 
overuse in nature (Hill, Collins, & Posthumus, 2015; 
Kerr et al., 2013) and highly frequent in shoulders 
during an athlete’s career (Barbosa et al, 2000; Blache, 
2018). Despite the higher scores on the Left Shoulder 
Mobility test, the non -elite group revealed higher 
asymmetry incidence when compared to the elite 
group. T hat might be due to the breathing technique 
used during freestyle swimming if there is a lateral 
dominance that may lead to incorrect swimming 
technique and increase those imbalances (Higson, 
2018). Therefore, more research is needed to clarify 
the potenti al influence of swimming techniques on 
movement functionality asymmetries which may 
predispose swimmers to overuse injury.  
There is limited data regarding the relationship 
between FMS® scores and physical performance 
among athletes (Kraus, 2014; Silva et a l., 2015). In 
fact, a thorough search of the relevant literature 
yielded only two studies analyzing the relationship between FMS® composite scores and swimming 
performance (Bond, 2015; Gunay, 2017). When 
analyzing the referred relationship, we found a 
positive correlation between FMS® composite scores 
and 100m freestyle performance, i.e., young 
swimmers with higher levels of movement 
functionality were able to achieve better 
performances. These results supported previous 
research where 100m freestyle perfor mance was also 
positively related to movement functionality in young 
swimmers (Bond, 2015). In another study, the authors 
analyzed the relationship between FMS® composite 
scores and 200m individual medley swimming 
performance (Gunay, 2017). Although they d id not 
find a correlation between the aforementioned 
variables, it should be noted that the distance and 
swimming stroke analyzed were not the same as ours. 
Since FMS® comprises 7 fundamental movement 
patterns that require mobility, neuromuscular control, 
balance, and stability, our results also support previous 
research that referred to ankle, knees, hip and shoulder 
mobility as key kinematic determinants of sprint 
swimming performance (Connaboy, 2015). 
Interestingly, ankle and shoulder mobility have not 
been related to swimming performance in male 
swimmers, whereas shoulder mobility was 
significantly related to 100m freestyle performance in 
female swimmers (Geladas, Nassis, & Pavlicevics, 
2015). However, these authors did not use FMS® test 
battery and thus  more research is needed to clarify the 
relationship between swimmers’ functional movement 
patterns assessed through FMS® and 100m freestyle 
performance.  
There are some limitations that we should be aware in 
the current study. First, we should mention the 
sample’s dimension and heterogeneity (elite group n = 
32; non -elite group n = 17). Secondly, we have 
considered neither the athlete’s history of injuries nor 
the training frequency. Past injuries and training 
frequency should be considered since those variables 
potentially impact on swimming performance (Okada, 
Huxel, & Nesser, 2011). Our sample consisted of only 
young swimmers and we should be careful when  
generalizing our findings for older trained swimmers. 
All variables were assessed at one moment (cross -
sectional design) (Cid et al., 2019; Monteiro et al., 
2018 , Rodrigues et  al., 2019 ). Finally, we have not 
analysed analyzed  relevant variables such as 
anthropometric data (e.g.: skinfolds, body fat 
Cuadernos de Psicología del Deporte, 21, 2 (abril)  
 
 
Dineia  et al.  
 170 
percentage, waist -to-hip ratio). By including 
anthropometric data, we could have been able to draw 
more accurate comparisons with previous studies. 
Further research including longitudinal and 
experimental inves tigation on functional movement 
development and physical performance in young 
swimmers is needed . 
CONCLUSIONES  
Our findings have shown that young elite swimmers 
have higher movement functionality compared to 
young non -elite swimmers. In fact, young non -elite 
swimmers might have relevant functional deficits in 
tasks involving mobility of the hips, knees and ankles, 
proper stride mechanics during a stepping motion, and 
also stabilization of the core and spine in an anterior 
and posterior plane during a close d‐chain upper body 
movement. Furthermore, our results suggest that 
young swimmers with higher movement functionality 
are able to achieve better performances in 100m 
freestyle.  
PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS  
Swimming coaches/medical staff should be aware of 
the pot ential movement functionality differences 
between young elite and non -elite swimmers since 
specific deficits require adjusted training programs in 
order to maximize performance.
