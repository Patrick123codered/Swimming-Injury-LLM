Background Injury and illness surveillance in the
aquatic disciplines has been conducted during the FINAWorld Championships and Olympic Games. Thedevelopment of an aquatic-speci ﬁc injury and illness
surveillance system will improve the quality of the datacollected and the development of preventive measures.Our ultimate objective is to enhance aquatic athletehealth and performance.Objective The objective was to re ﬁne the injury and
illness surveillance protocols to develop aquatic-speci ﬁc
deﬁnitions of injury and illness; de ﬁne aquatic-speci ﬁc
injury location and causation; better describe overuseinjuries; regard pre-existing and recurrent injuries; moreaccurately de ﬁne aquatic athlete exposures and develop
a protocol to capture out-of-competition aquatic athletehealth parameters.Methods FINA compiled an Injury and Illness
Surveillance Expert Working Group comprised ofinternational experts to review the scienti ﬁc literature in
theﬁeld. A consensus meeting was convened to provide
an opportunity for debate, following whichrecommendations were collated.Results Aquatic-speci ﬁc injury and illness surveillance
protocols covering both the in-competition and out-of-competition time periods were developed. De ﬁnitions for
all relevant variables were outlined, and documentationforms for athletes and for clinicians were proposed.Recommendations for the implementation of an injuryand illness surveillance system for FINA are presented.Conclusion The FINA consensus authors recommend
ongoing in-competition and out-of-competitionsurveillance to determine injury and illness trends overtime. The implementation of the de ﬁnitions and
methodology outlined in this paper will improve theaccuracy and value of injury and illness surveillance, andprovide important information for injury prevention.
INTRODUCTION
Aquatic sport (swimming, diving, water polo, syn-
chronised swimming, open water swimming andhigh diving), the second largest sport based on thenumber of athletes at the Olympic Games, is gov-erned by the FINA. Approximately 2500 athletesfrom 180 countries compete at the FINA W orldChampionships before a cumulative global audi-ence of 4.5 billion. As the custodian of a sport thatenjoys global popularity and participation through-out the lifespan, FINA has the responsibility of pro-tecting the health and well-being of its athletes. ItsMedical Rules clearly outline: “FINA …should takecare that sport is practised without danger to the
health of the athletes… T o that end, it takes the
measures necessary to preserve the health of ath-letes and to minimise the risks of physical injuryand psychological harm. ”
1
Athlete health protection should be on a meth-
odologically sound injury and illness surveillancemodel for the accurate collection of data to clearlydeﬁne the health risks of the speci ﬁc sport.
2–5
Several International Sport Federations have pub-
lished methods and/or consensus statements for
injury and illness surveillance based on the require-ments and characteristics of their sport, such asfootball,
67cricket,8rugby,91 0tennis,11skiing,12
horse racing,13athletics14and multisport events.15
These approaches are an important step towardsinjury and illness prevention.
16
Previous injury and illness surveillance in
aquatic sports
FINA participated in the 2004 Athens Olympic
Games on injury surveillance team sport with itsdiscipline of water polo.
17All aquatic disciplines
were included in the injury surveillance during the2008 Beijing Olympic Games,
18and in the injury
and illness surveillance during the 2012 LondonOlympic Games.
19FINA conducted its ﬁrst injury
and illness surveillance during the 2009 FINAW orld Championships.
20In 2013, a retrospective
survey capturing physical complaints in the 4 weeksprior to the Championships was also implementedto ascertain the magnitude of overuse injuries notcaptured using the traditional methodology.
21A
further FINA project on out-of-competition illnessanalysed the prevalence of asthma in a large cohortof close to 1500 elite aquatic athletes competing atthe Olympic Games and FINA W orldChampionships during the time period of 2004 –
2009.
22
The IOC methodology for injury and illness sur-
veillance15used for the FINA injury and illness sur-
veillance in Rome20and Barcelona21had important
limitations for aquatic events with regard to expos-
ure (speci ﬁcally for swimming relays, open water
swimming team, synchronised swimming team and
synchronised diving events) and injury location(speci ﬁcally head injuries in water polo requires
further differentiation). More importantly, the IOCsurveillance protocol was not designed to capturethe true extent of overuse injuries, since it focuseson acute, new-onset injuries during thein-competition time period. However, FINA studiesshowed that 37.5% of all injuries during the W orld

Championship were caused by overuse,20and injuries incurred
in the out-of-competition period were still present during com-
petition.21Also, the high prevalence of asthma in the elite
swimmer reported by Mountjoy et al22is not captured in the
IOC protocol which only records new-onset illnesses or exacer-
bations of existing illnesses.22
Consensus meeting objectives
The methodological limitations outlined above demonstrate the
need for FINA to re ﬁne the in-competition injury and illness
surveillance protocols speci ﬁcally for the aquatics sports and to
cover both the in-competition and out-of-competition timeperiods. The objectives were to:▸Develop aquatic-speci ﬁcd eﬁnitions of injury and illness;
▸Specify aquatic-speci ﬁc injury location and causation;
▸Better describe overuse injuries;
▸Regard pre-existing and recurrent injuries;
▸Develop a protocol and documentation forms to captureout-of-competition health problems of aquatic athletes;
▸More accurately de ﬁne aquatic athlete exposures.
METHODS
T o realise the objectives outlined above, FINA convened anInjury and Illness Surveillance Expert W orking Group (FINAconsensus group). Participants included a project lead (MM), ascienti ﬁc lead (AJ), experts in sports injury epidemiology (AJ,
BC, IS, BMP), aquatic sports medicine (MM, KK, CvdH, DG,HPD), sport psychiatry (SM) and an athlete representative (PH).Prior to the consensus meeting, relevant topic areas were deter-mined by the project coordinator and scienti ﬁc lead. Each topic
was assigned a lead expert and a secondary participant whowere responsible for conducting a literature review and draftinga preliminary summary of the designated topic(s). The topic
summaries were collated and circulated for review by all partici-
pants prior to the meeting.
The consensus meeting was held at Aspetar in Doha, Qatar,
in December 2014. The meeting was moderated by a non-aquatic sport medicine expert (KMK) and recorded in an audioﬁle and transcribed by an administrative assistant. Each topic
was presented by the identi ﬁed lead participant and discussion
by all participants ensued. Following discussion, consensus wasreached by the participants under the guidance of the moder-ator. Any discrepancies following discussion were identi ﬁed in
the audio and meeting notes. After the meeting, the participants
redrafted their respective topic assignments based on the discus-sions at the meeting. These new modi ﬁed scienti ﬁc summaries
along with the audio ﬁles and the administrative assistant
meeting notes were reviewed, and all data were collated in an
initial consensus document draft by the project lead. This initialconsensus document was edited by the scienti ﬁc lead prior to
the circulation to all participants for review. All comments wereonce again collated, and a second consensus document wasdrafted by the project lead and reviewed by the science lead.This document and subsequent iterations were circulated to allparticipants for comment and ﬁnal review.
23Any remaining dis-
crepancies in consensus are notated in this ﬁnal document.
CONSENSUS RECOMMENDATIONS
Deﬁnitions of injury and illness
The FINA consensus group reviewed the published injury and
illness de ﬁnitions, and modi ﬁed the wording as required to
ensure aquatic speci ﬁcity:
Medical condition/health-related incident :“Any physical or
psychological complaint or disorder experienced by an athlete,irrespective of the need for medical attention or time loss fromtraining or competing in an aquatic discipline. ”
14
Injury :“A physical complaint or observable damage to body
tissue produced by the transfer of energy experienced or sus-tained by an athlete during participation in training or compet-
ing in an aquatic discipline, regardless of whether it received
medical attention or its consequences with respect to impair-ments in competition or training ”(based on refs. 91 4).
Illness :“A complaint or disorder experienced by an athlete
not related to injury, regardless of whether it received medicalattention or its consequences with respect to impairments intraining or competing in an aquatic discipline. ”
14An illness can
be either physical or psychological. A psychological illness canbe a response to psychological trauma suffered during sport (ie,abuse, harassment, post-traumatic stress disorder, response tosport injury) or suffered outside of sport (ie, Diagnostic andStatistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM V)diagnoses).
Medical attention :“An injury or illness where a quali ﬁed clin-
ician has assessed the athlete ’s medical condition ”(based on
refs. 691 11 4 ).
Clinician: FINA has 208 member federations with very differ-
ent healthcare cultures. Therefore, it would be restrictive todeﬁne‘quali ﬁed clinician ’with traditional titles, especially since
the same title can mean different things in different regions.The FINA consensus group de ﬁnes a clinician as “anyone who
is involved in the health care of athletes, reviews medical orphysiological information, and/or implements an action plan toimprove the athlete ’s health, where health is considered in a
broad sense but must be more than just performance enhance-ment. ”Clinicians include, but are not limited to, the team phys-
ician, physiotherapist, physiologist, nurse, physician assistant,etc. For example, sport scientists who review lactate results andalter a training programme are not acting as clinicians.However, sport scientists (who are licensed or designated bylicensed professionals to act on their behalf) who review bloodtests for anaemia and recommend iron are acting as clinicians.
Time loss: “A time-loss injury or illness leads to the athlete
being unable to take full part in FINA activities ”(based on refs.
691 4 ). If the athlete misses the rest of the training or competi-
tion session but returns for the next training/competition, thisshould be recorded as a time-loss incident.
Deﬁnitions of recurrences, reinjuries and exacerbations
Fuller et al24were the ﬁrst to address the de ﬁnition and classi ﬁ-
cation of recurrences, reinjuries and exacerbations in injury sur-
veillance. Subsequently, Hamilton et al,25Finch and Cook26and
Shrier et al27published different de ﬁnitions and classi ﬁcation
systems. The FINA consensus group discussed the different
models, and decided to adopt the classi ﬁcation system of
Hamilton et al.25Although the later models26 27appear to have
advantages over traditional models, they are only being devel-oped recently, and the FINA consensus group felt it was tooearly to recommend them for general use.
Index injury :“The ﬁrst recorded injury in a series of injuries
constituting a recurrent condition. ”
25
Exacerbation: “Injury to same location and of the same type
as the index injury , where the index injury has not completelyhealed. ”
25
Reinjury :“Injury to same location and of the same type as the
index injury, where the index injury has completely healed. ”25
Local injury :“Injury to same location but a different type
from the index injury. ”25

New injury :“Injury to a different location from the index
injury. ”25
The FINA consensus group recommends that the terms
‘acute ’and ‘chronic ’should generally not be used when describ-
ing aquatics injuries, because of their ambiguities, overlap and
confusion with ‘traumatic ’and ‘overuse ’injury (which are
deﬁned below). Where the context requires them to be used,
they should be explicitly de ﬁned.
Mechanism or causation of injury
According to van Mechelen et al,2Meeuwisse and colleagues,34
and Bahr and Krosshaug,28clearly de ﬁning the injury mechan-
ism may identify future prevention interventions. Mode of
onset for sports injuries is typically classi ﬁed as being either
traumatic or overuse. Theoretically, the difference between thetwo types is the nature of the energy transfer that caused them.For traumatic injuries the energy transfer is instantaneous,whereas for overuse injuries it is accumulated over time.
26
Operationally, however, sports injuries are classi ﬁed based on
whether they are linked to a speci ﬁc, clearly identi ﬁable event
such as a fall or a collision (traumatic) or not (overuse).61 31 4
T raumatic injury : Refers to an injury caused by a single,
clearly identi ﬁable energy transfer.91 4The mechanism of a trau-
matic injury can be further speci ﬁed in (1) non-contact, (2)
contact with another athlete/person and (3) contact with anobject or animal (goal post, diving board, lane marker, sea life,water surface from heights). A separate classi ﬁcation of import-
ance in the development of prevention interventions is thedetermination of the presence of a rule violation as a causativefactor.
Overuse injury : Refers to a condition caused by multiple accu-
mulative bouts of energy transfer without a single, identi ﬁable
event responsible for the injury.
61 4
It is important to recognise the potential con ﬂict between the
theoretical and operational de ﬁnitions of overuse injury. The
operational de ﬁnition for overuse is, in effect, made by exclu-
sion and does not consider the actual cause of the injury.Application of this operational de ﬁnition is normally straight
forward, as for most aquatics injuries the presence or absence ofan inciting event is easy to determine. However, in certain cases,it may be a challenge. For some overuse injuries, symptom onsetcan be rapid despite being preceded by a subclinical process ofcumulative tissue damage. For example, pain may develop overthe course of a single training session, or even instantaneouslyduring a ‘normal ’loading situation, such as when a diver sud-
denly feels the onset of a back pain in a pars stress fracture.
29In
such cases, there is a substantial risk of misclassi ﬁcation. Certain
authors have attempted to solve this challenge by sub classifyingoveruse injuries into those with a rapid onset and those with agradual onset.
15 30 31However, even when this is done, the
same dif ﬁculties arise in differentiating between rapid-onset
overuse injuries and acute injuries. In these cases, the injuryrecorder needs to make a clinical judgement based on the theor-etical de ﬁnition of overuse and acute injuries. In particular, it
should be considered whether the energy transfer occurring atthe perceived moment of injury was suf ﬁcient to damage previ-
ously healthy, intact tissue.
Circumstances of injury
The circumstances of injury include the discipline and event(for grouping see below), the classi ﬁcation as training or compe-
tition and if the latter, the competition level (ie, heat, semiﬁ nals,
ﬁnals, quarter ﬁnals, preliminaries).Discipline refers to one of the six aquatic sports (swimming,
diving, synchronised swimming, open water swimming, waterpolo and high diving).
Event is de ﬁned as “the type of competition activity for
which medals are awarded following ﬁnals (ie, 400 m free, 50 m
breaststroke, 4×200 m medley relay, 10 m Synchro, DuetT echnical Routine). ”
Competition is deﬁned as “the period during which the ath-
letes participate in an event against athletes from another team/league/ nation that are timed (swimming and open water swim-ming), judged (synchronized swimming, diving and high diving)or during match play (water polo). ”
T raining is de ﬁned as “physical activities that are aimed at
maintaining or improving athletic skills or physical condition. ”
11
The warm-up/cool-down period before/after a competitionshould be recorded as training exposure.
11
Location, type and diagnosis of injury
Categories for reporting location and type of injury have beenpublished previously.
691 11 3 –15For water polo, the FINA con-
sensus group recommends to document injury to the face inmore detail (see box 1 ).
For reporting the type of injury, the FINA consensus group
recommends the use of previously published formats
14 15for
paper-based reports as outlined in box 2 , and either the
Orchard Sports Injury Classiﬁ cation System (OSICS)32of the
Sport Medicine Diagnostic Coding System (SMDCS)33for
online reporting. The use of an additional free-text box wouldallow the reporting clinician to add more detail when necessary.
Diagnosis and cause of illness
In comparison with diagnosis systems for injuries, there is lesspublished on the diagnosis of illnesses in sports medicine.
11 14 36
The FINA consensus group recommends utilisation of the

classi ﬁcations for ‘affected body systems ’and ‘symptoms ’of
illness in the aquatic sports (see boxes 3 and4).
The FINA consensus group recommends the inclusion of aeti-
ology or cause of illness. In particular, it should be reported
whether the illness is (1) new onset, recurrent or pre-existing,and (2) communicable versus non-communicable.
The FINA consensus group recommends that a diagnosis be
recorded only when provided by a clinician, and that athletereports should be limited to symptoms and their consequencesfor training and competition. Both sports medicine-speci ﬁc
coding systems (OSICS
32and SMDCS33) have classi ﬁcation
codes for the recording of medical illness in athletes. TheOSICS has 301 classi ﬁcation codes for the recording of medical
illness as they pertain to athletes (codes # 181– 402).
32While it
is not feasible to utilise the detail of these coding systems on apaper-based illness reporting form, it is possible to utilise thesecoding systems in electronic reporting. The principle non-sportsmedicine-related coding system for disease and injury is theInternational Classiﬁ cation of Diseases and Injuries (ICD);
however, this system is not speci ﬁc enough for utilisation in
sports medicine.
38 39
Severity of injury and illness
Historically, sports federations have assessed severity in relationto the number of days missed from sport participation,
691 11 31 4
The FINA consensus group recommends this approach in orderto facilitate comparison with other sports. However, limitationsof this approach in recording the severity of injuries and ill-nesses that do not lead to time loss are recognised. In particular,the true impact of overuse injuries is underestimated using timeloss, as athletes in aquatics and other sports often continue totrain and compete with a potential impact on performancedespite their existence.
21 29 40
When studies aim to record all injury and illness problems,
including those that do not lead to time loss, the use of alterna-tive methods of measuring severity should be considered. Forexample, a severity score could be based on athletes’ responses
to a questionnaire on the consequences of injury and illness on
sports participation, training volume, performance and degreeof symptoms.
40 41The International Classiﬁ cation of
Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) can also be utilised toclassify severity.
42T able 1 shows different ways of grading
injury/illness severity. Ultimately, the speci ﬁc method of deter-
mining severity should be de ﬁned by the research question
being asked and always explicitly stated when reporting.
If a time-loss approach is used, the de ﬁnition of full recovery
also needs to be clearly stated.43Some investigators have used
practical solutions such as return to full participation.24Others
have argued that the healing date should be the date the last
treatment was applied for an injury27 44because many partici-
pants return to full participation while still injured.21 29 45
Exposure
The underlying principle for assessing exposure is to put thenumber of injuries and illnesses in context, so that one cancompare the risk of injury across sports and time. Forout-of-competition studies, the number of athletes included, theduration of the observation period as well as the exposure inBox 3 Categories for affected system by illness14 19– 21 34 36 37

training and competition should be recorded. Exposure in train-
ing should be documented in hours, whereas exposure in com-petition should follow the in-competition surveillance system.
The duration of the championship is de ﬁned from the time
period between and including the ﬁrst and last day of competi-
tion regardless of whether or not the competition for the indi-vidual athlete is completed. For in-competition projects, aregistered athlete is one who is listed on the of ﬁcial entry list for
the competition by the authoritative governing body independ-ent of whether the athlete actually participated in the event.
15
T o calculate the athlete competition days , the number of regis-
tered athletes is to be multiplied by the total number of compe-tition days for the each discipline.
21
When calculating starts in aquatics, a discipline-speci ﬁc
approach is required. For individual sports, one sums thenumber of starts in all heats, rounds, quali ﬁcations and ﬁnals for
all athletes, including athletes who did not ﬁnish and were dis-
quali ﬁed.
15For water polo, the number of player-matches
should be calculated as 2 teams×7 players×the number of
matches played.64 6For the remaining non-individual sports
such as open water swimming team events, swimming relays,
synchronised diving and synchronised swimming events, thenumber of starts should be calculated by multiplying the
number of athletes on a team by the number of entries.
21If an
athlete starts in more than one discipline, each start iscounted.
21
Calculation of incidence and prevalence
The incidence is the number of new occurrences of an injury/
illness in relation to the athletes at risk in a given time period.
Incidence may be calculated as the number of new injuries/ill-nesses per 100 athletes,
21per 1000 athletes exposures, or per
1000 athlete-days47 48or per 1000 h of exposure.6 7 11 15
Incidence of training injuries may be reported as per 1000
athlete-days or per 1000 training hours. Incidence of competi-
tioninjuries may be reported as injuries per 1000 starts15or per
1000 player-matches69or per 1000 player-hours.61 5
Prevalence is the proportion of athletes affected by a speci ﬁc
condition at a de ﬁned time (point prevalence) or time period
(eg, 12-month prevalence, life-time prevalence), and iscalculated by dividing the number of athletes with an injury or
illness (regardless of the onset time) by the total number of ath-letes. Prevalence is often useful in cross-sectional studies, andfor both long-term conditions and those in which a de ﬁnite
start date is dif ﬁcult to de ﬁne, such as overuse injuries.
29 41 45
Some prospective studies with serial measurements of preva-lence have reported the average prevalence over the duration ofthe study or the season.
40 41 45
Athlete characteristics
The FINA consensus group recommends that basic athletecharacteristics be recorded for injury and illness surveillancestudies in the aquatic sport including age, sex, discipline,event(s) and nationality. Further information, such as years ofcompetitive experience, competition/ training load, underlyinghealth issues and recent time zone changes, might be includeddepending on the research question.
Grouping of FINA events
Depending on the research question, FINA events can begrouped for ease of comparison. For example, in the FINAstudy on the prevalence of asthma, the aquatic endurance disci-plines of swimming, open water swimming and synchronisedswimming were grouped together and compared with thenon-endurance discipline of diving.
22Other groupings of disci-
plines include (1) aesthetic (synchronised swimming, diving,high diving) versus non-aesthetic disciplines (water polo, swim-ming and open water swimming), and (2) timed events (swim-ming, open water swimming) versus non-timed event(synchronised swimming, diving and water polo). Within thedisciplines themselves, groupings can also occur. For example,in swimming, results can be grouped by stroke type (breaststroke, freestyle, butter ﬂy, back stroke) or by distance (sprint (50
+100 m), middle distance (200+400 m), long distance(≥800 m)).
Implementation methods
Who reports?
For in-competition injury and illness surveillance, the FINA con-
sensus group recommends the reporting to be done by a clin-ician (for de ﬁnition see above) to capture medical attention and
time-loss injuries/illnesses. When the researchers would like toregister allinjuries (ie, complaints of overuse injuries), athletes
reporting on their own medical conditions is desirable.Furthermore, coaches of aquatic athletes can also report ath-letes’health problems.
Reporting frequency
Daily reporting is recommended for in-competition injury andillness surveillance.
15For out of competition and long-term pro-
spective studies, injury and illness reporting should occur on aweekly basis to decrease recall bias.
49
Reporting and recording methods
In addition to the traditional injury and illness surveillancemethods conducted with paper-based reporting systems, thedigital media offers more options for data collection. Recentstudies demonstrate the bene ﬁts of SMS texting as a means of
reporting injury and/or illness status,
50–52and the completion of
online questionnaires of athlete health status.40 41Likewise
there are many sports medicine-speci ﬁc software programmes
available to facilitate the ef ﬁciency and accuracy of injury and
illness surveillance in sports medicine.53T o be effective,Table 1 Different methods of defining injury/illness severity

The definition of severity depends on the perspective of the stakeholder. For some
athletes, severity might refer to suffering (eg, pain), or need for surgery. For a coachtrying to manage a team, or a clinician having to make return-to-play decision,severity might be assessed by time loss (disability). For team management, it mightbe cost.*If the athlete misses the rest of the training or competition session but returns forthe next training/competition (same day, next day or later), the injury is recorded as a
time-loss injury of 0 days.

electronic injury surveillance programmes should be easy to use,
allow data entry at any time and include data validation.
Future recording of medical conditions in the aquatic sports
Given the ﬁnding that a high percentage of elite aquatic athletes
of all disciplines train and compete with injury,21and the high
prevalence of asthma in swimming,22the FINA consensus group
recommends the prospective monitoring of athletes’ health in
all aquatic disciplines throughout the year. Prospective injuryand illness surveillance during the in-competition andout-of-competition period may be conducted by the reportingof symptoms/complaints by the athlete, or by the recording ofmedical conditions by a clinician at prede ﬁned regular intervals
at least on a weekly basis to minimise recall bias.
Up until now, very few methods have been proposed for the
prospective recording of medical conditions that include com-
plaints not leading to absence from sport.
11 14 40Report forms
and questionnaires must be designed to match the objectives of
the speci ﬁc study , however should include the variables outlined
above. The Oslo Sports T rauma Research Centre (OSTRC)developed a questionnaire on health problems based on theirOveruse Injury Questionnaire,
41and validated it in elite athletes
of various sports in Norway including swimming.40This ques-
tionnaire has four key questions that must always be answeredby the athlete, as well as subsequent questions that can be modi-ﬁed to suit the project needs. A modi ﬁed version was developed
and implemented by FINA and IAAF in 2013 to assess the pres-ence of physical complaints in the out-of-competition periodleading into the W orld Championships.

The FINA consensus group developed for health surveillance
in aquatic athletes during in-competition andout-of-competition period, (1) a self-report for aquatic athletesthat includes the four initial questions of the OSTRC question-naire on health problems
40plus detailed information on the
injury or illness as outlined above (see online supplementaryappendix 1
i), as well a similar report form for clinician (seeonline supplementary appendix 2). The FINA expert workinggroup recommends the use of these forms in the in-competitionand out-of-competition period, and encourages validation ofthese protocols. Electronic versions can be developed and arerecommended for use in long-term studies (for a development
guide see http://www.ostrc.no/ ﬁna).
CONCLUSIONS
The FINA consensus authors recommend ongoing
in-competition surveillance to determine injury and illnesstrends over time. Evident by the high prevalence of overuseinjuries
21and asthma22in aquatic athletes, the utilisation of a
prospective out-of-competition surveillance system is also
recommended. Assessment of risk factors should be included inthe injury and illness surveillance projects to facilitate the devel-opment of preventive interventions. The implementation of thedeﬁnitions and methodology outlined in this paper will improve
the accuracy and value of injury and illness surveillance pro-
grammes in aquatic sports. Ultimately, this should lead toenhanced health and performance of aquatic athletes.
