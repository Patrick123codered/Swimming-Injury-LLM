Abstract 
Context: Youth through masters level competitive swimmers incur significant shoulder pain. 
Risk factors associated with shoulder pain include high swimming yardage, a lack of cross 
training, decreased shoulder strength and reduced core endurance, and limited posterior shoulder 
and pectoral length. Since training, swimming exposure and physical performance measures 
have all been associated with shoulder pain, the methods utilized to train swimmers may 
influence the development of shoulder pain, yet studies delineating training methods are lacking. 
Objectives : (1) To identify in-water and dry land practices among youth through masters level 
swimmers in the United States, and (2) describe the potential effects of training practices on 
swimmers’ shoulders. Design/Setting : A web based survey was developed to identify common 
training practices in 5 areas: (1) quantification of swimming and dry land training, (2) in water 
techniques such as kicking drills, (3) upper body stretching, (4) shoulder and core strengthening, 
and (5) cross training. Participants : (N= 352) 156 swim team coaches or captains of youth, high 
school, and college swim teams and 196 masters swimmers participated. There was geographic 
representation from across the US. Results: Responses indicated diverse training practices. 
However, most respondents used kicking drills, which may provoke shoulder pain due to 
prolonged poor positioning. High yardage swum by high school and college teams increases their 
risk of shoulder tendinopathy. Stretching and strengthening exercises and dosages commonly 
utilized were inconsistent with current research recommendations and lacked specificity in terms 
of addressing typical mobility restrictions and muscle weaknesses described in the swimming 
literature. Core strengthening and cross training are frequently performed. Conclusions : Several 
areas of in water and dry land practice were identified that may put swimmers shoulders at risk 
for injury. Further research regarding the safety and efficacy of training programs is 
recommended to determine optimal methods of injury prevention and performance enhancement.

INTRODUCTION 
Competitive swimmers place an extreme amount of stress on their shoulders due to the 
repetitive nature of the sport.  Allegrucci and colleagues have reported that swimming 10,000 
meters/day using 10 stroke cycles per lap equates to 4000 revolutions per day.1  Pink and Tibone 
report that competitive swimmers may swim 10,000 to 15,000 meters a day, 6-7 days per week, 
with most shoulder revolutions done repetitively without rest for muscle recovery.2  Those 
swimming distance events may swim double this amount.2  Shoulder pain is a common problem 
with a reported prevalence ranging from 40% to 91% among elite and non elite competitive 
swimmers. 1,3-5  A recent study of high school competitive swimmers revealed that 72% used 
pain medication in order to manage their shoulder pain during practice, with 47% using it 
regularly.6  The reported pain may be so severe that it can lead to functional impairments and 
may terminate swimming participation.7  
In 1978, the term “swimmer’s shoulder” was used to describe anterior shoulder pain 
during and after workouts.8  Sinc e swimmer’s shoulder was first coined, the term now represents 
a group of symptoms rather than a specific diagnosis.9  High training volume during growth and 
the absence of a well-designed and balanced dry-land training program have been cited as  main 
factors in the development of swimmer’s shoulder.10  In order to minimize the incidence and 
severity of swimmer’s shoulder, conditioning programs are often implemented as a part of a 
competitive swim training program.11,12 Two common methods are in-water and dry land 
training.  In-water training may utilize equipment such as kick boards, hand paddles, and 
parachutes as well as activities isolating a specific portion of the stroke such as streamline 
kicking in which the hands are clasped overhead with arms extended.  Dry land programs often 
include strengthening, stretching and cross training activities.  The goals of both in-water and dry

land training programs are similar: to improve performance and/or to prevent injury.  Yet 
commonly used in-water and dry land training programs have not been identified nor have their 
effects on swimme rs’ shoulders. 
Potentially modifiable factors associated with an increased prevalence of shoulder pain 
have been researched.  Sein and colleagues used a survey to assess swimming exposure and 
performed physical examinations and MRI studies on the shoulders of elite competitive 
swimmers aged 13-25.4  They concluded that supraspinatus tendinopathy was the cause of 
shoulder pain, as it was present in 69% of those undergoing imaging.4  Weekly mileage and 
hours per week swum were highly associated with shoulder pain in this study.4 Tate et al 
performed a cross sectional study of youth through masters level competitive swimmers.5  
Participants completed a survey which included questions on demographics, quantity of 
swimming regularly performed, and participation in other sports.5  They then underwent a 
physical exam of their shoulder as well as measures of core endurance.5  Consistent with the 
findings of Sein et al4, swimmers with high pain and disability performed greater swimming 
yardage.5  A lack of cross training, decreased shoulder strength and reduced core endurance, and 
limited posterior shoulder and pectoral length were also associated with those having greater 
pain and disability.5 Symptomatic Division 1 collegiate swimmers were also found to have 
reduced pectoral length compared to their less symptomatic colleagues.13  
Given that swimming exposure, training methods, and physical performance measures 
have all been associated with shoulder pain in competitive swimmers, it appears that the methods 
utilized to train swimmers may influence the development of shoulder pain.  While severa l 
studies have examined the effects of specific in-water and dry land training programs on 
swimming performance 12,14-17, there is a lack of research describing commonly used team

training practices and their potential effects on competitive swimmers ’ shoulders .  Therefore, the 
purposes of this study were to (1) identify in-water and dry land practices among youth through 
masters level swimmers in the United States, and (2 ) describe the potential effects of these 
practices on swimmers’ shoulders.   
METHODS 
Design 
A web based survey was developed using Survey Monkey® (Palo Alto, CA) and 
Vovici™ version 5 (Herndon, VA).  The survey requested demographic information regarding 
the name of the team, number of participants, level of competition and city/state as well as the 
person completing the survey, and their contact information.  This information was used to 
accurately describe the subject pool, eliminate duplicate entries for teams, and to contact the 
participant if needed to clarify a specific response.  In addition, the survey contained 25 
questions covering 5 areas: (1) quantification of swimming and dry land training in terms of 
frequency, yardage and time, (2) in-water training techniques such as use of various kicking 
drills, paddles and drag clothing/apparatus, (3) upper body and core stretching, (4) shoulder and 
core strengthening exercises, and (5) cross training.  Questions had multiple-choice responses, 
and participants selected all appropriate responses for exercises in which they or their team 
engaged.  Photographs of common stretching and strengthening exercises were provided so that 
participants could more readily identify exercises they might be using.  (See Appendix).  
Exercises described in research articles on competitive swimming were selected as well as those 
used by teams on which the researchers or their family members previously belonged.  An 
“other” response  was also provided where additional training methods/exercises could be input.

Participants 
This study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards at and Coaches and captains 
aged 18 years or older of youth, high school, and college swim teams and members of masters 
swim teams were identified by personal contacts or web based searches and then recruited by 
word of mouth or email to participate in the web based survey.  Additionally , masters swimmers 
and coaches were invited to participate by notices in the United States (US) Masters Swimming 
newsletter, the Ocean City New Jersey Masters swim team newsletter, and Daily News of Open 
Water Swimming  
Statistical Analysis 
Data was analyzed using SPSS® statistical software (version 19.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, 
IL).  Descriptive analysis included frequency of response for nominal data and means and 
standard deviations for interval data.  Similar open-ended responses indicated as “other” were 
categorized by the researchers and tabulated if there were 2 or more of the same/similar 
response.  Responses that were unique to a single study participant were not included in the data 
analysis. 
RESULTS  
Three hundred and fifty-two swimmers and coaches from the United States completed the 
survey.  The data received from an additional two international swimmers was not used for data 
analysis.  Masters swimmers comprised 196 of the subject pool, and these were responses of 
individuals aged 18 or older not competing for a college team at the time of survey completion.  
The remainder of the responses were from coaches or adult captains at the youth , high school or 
collegiate level.  These responses represent team training practices with teams ranging from 2 to 
over 100 participants.  One hundred eight (30.7%) of the study participants were from the

Northeast, 73 (20.7%) were from the Midwest, 84 (23.9%) were from the South, 73 (20.7%) 
were from the West, and 14 (4.0%) did not disclose their location.  Table 1 provides the 
breakdown of participants from each of the 4 training groups: youth (which was further divided 
into competitive age groups: aged 8 and under, aged 9 and 10, aged 11 and 12, aged 13 and 14, 
and aged 15 and over), high school, college, and masters.  Table 1 also includes the size of the 
teams as well as quantification of dryland training and swimming exposure with respect to time 
and distance for regular practices and training trips, if taken.  The practice model of the team is 
also indicated with respect to whether all team members of similar age or ability complete 
similar or different yardages during swimming practices.  Only the college teams had greater 
than 5% of respondents reporting use of a training trip.  For this group, the mean reported 
yardage and practice time prior to the trip were 7515.35 +/- 2201.68 meters/day and 3.28+/-1.92 
hours respectively.  These values increased to 10043.16 +/-2569.15 meters/day and 4.32 +/-2.26 
hours during the trip.  Table 2 contains the in-water kicking and upper body resistance training 
practices.  Table 3 contains the methods by which stretching exercises are performed and the 
dosage of stretching utilized (time and repetitions).  Table 4 details the stretching exercises 
performed by each group.  Table 5 quantifies the types of dry land resistance training used and 
how the amount of resistance is determined.  Table 6 details the upper extremity and core 
strengthening exercises performed by each group, and Table 7 contains the types of dry land 
training used.  For all categorical data in which subjects selected from the choices indicated in 
the survey, table entries indicate percentage of respondents who selected each category unless 
otherwise noted.

DISCUSSION 
To our knowledge, this is the first study to quantify both in water and dryland training 
exposure and identify training methods used among all age groups of competitive swimmers 
across the United States.  Our results indicate that training varies widely among swim teams and 
masters swimmers but frequently utilized methods and mean quantity of training could be 
identified.  
Table 1 reveals both an increasing quantity of time performing dry land  training and 
increasing distance swum per day from the youth through the college swimmers, then a reduction 
in both measures for the masters swimmers.  We multiplied the reported distance swum by the 
number of practices per week and found a mean high school weekly yardage of 37,000 meters 
and mean college weekly yardage of over 44,000 meters.  A study by Seine and colleagues (Sein 
et al., 2010 ) found that elite swimmers aged 13-25 swimming 35,000 or more meters per week 
were four times more likely to have supraspinatus tendinopathy than swimmers completing less 
yardage.  Both the high school and college teams exceeded this value, placing them at high er risk 
for supraspinatus tendon injury and pain.  To our knowledge, no research is currently available to 
determine safe yardage exposure or progression for youth swimmers so the effect of currently 
reported yardage is unknown.  Also, only the collegiate teams consistently reported using 
different yardages for sprint and distance swimmers, while the majority of other groups all 
reported training the same distance without consideration for swimmer specialty as a sprinter or 
distance swimmer.  Costill and colleagues 18 found that completing a high amount of yardage in 
practice may reduce sprint capacity.  In this study, swimmers who completed 9435 meters/day 
demonstrated a significant decrease in sprint velocity compared to those who completed 4950 
meters/day of training.  Given that greater yardage has been correlated with shoulder pain and

supraspinatus tendinopathy, 4,5 and that it may reduce swimming performance, utilizing a varied 
practice model based on swimmer specialty as a sprinter or distance swimmer appears warranted.  
Among college teams engaging in a training trip, the mean distance swum during their training 
trip increased 33.64% from pre trip yardage.  Although we are not aware of any research 
identifying safe rates of progression for swimming yardage , the National Athletic Trainers’ 
Position Statement recommends that, “progression of training intensity, load, time, and distance 
should only increase by 10% each week to allow for adequate adaptation and to avoid 
overload ”.19  Based on this, an increase in training by 33.6% over a short period, typically a 
week, may put swimmers’ shoulders at risk for injury but furt her research is needed to define 
safe rates of training progression.   
Kicking drills including streamline kicking, standard kickboards use, and kick/pull drills 
are frequently used by all groups surveyed.  Despite this consistent practice pattern, Costill and 
colleagues have suggested limiting the amount of kickboard use to prevent shoulder 
impingement resulting from prolonged positioning of the shoulder in hyper-abduction.20  
O’Donnell and colleagues concluded that swimmin g with a kickboard may lead to shoulder 
laxity due to arm positioning and increased resistance placed on the shoulder.21  In addition, 
according to a survey of 1262 US age group, masters, or national teams swimmers, the use of 
kickboards tended to aggravate already painful shoulders.3  Taken collectively, research suggests 
that prolonged usage of kickboards may provoke or increase shoulder pain, but specific 
guidelines for safe usage are lacking.  The use of streamline kicking was nearly as popular as 
standard board use, but the sustained shoulder hyper-abduction positioning behind the ears has 
also been cited as placing the swimmer’s shoulder at an increased risk of injury.2  In contrast, 
kick/pull drills typically involve the use of kicking on one side with the ipsilateral arm overhead 
“Investigation of In-Water and Dry Land Training Programs for Competitive Swimmers in the United States ” by Tate A et al.

for a designated quantity of kicks followed by a brief pull sequence followed by kicking on the 
contralateral side with that arm overhead.  The advantage of these drills over the use of 
streamline or a kickboards is that bilateral sustained overhead positioning is avoided and the 
sidelying position may allow for reduced shoulder hyper-abduction.   
Several authors have related shoulder pain in swimmers to postural mal-alignments 
associated with a forward head position and rounded shoulders.1,22,23  Kendall, McCreary, and 
Provance originally proposed that a prolonged forward head and rounded shoulder posture, 
which is typical in swimmers due to the high demands on the shoulder adductor and internal 
rotator musculature, can lead to the imbalance between weak elongated scapular retractors and 
strong or tight pectoral muscles.24  In the presence of weak elongated posterior musculature, tight 
anterior musculature may pull the shoulders forward and protract the scapula, thereby 
contributing to subacromial impingement.2,22  Reductions in subacromial space with scapular 
protraction have been demonstrated on MRI 25 and reduced length of the pectoralis minor may 
additionally narrow the subacromial space by reducing scapular posterior tilt and external 
rotation during arm elevation.26    
By strengthening the antagonist muscles to those contributing to the forward head and 
shoulder posture and by performing specific stretches, two studies have reported positive 
alterations in competitive swimmers ’ posture.22,23  Kluemper et al used supervised partner 
assisted pectoralis minor and major stretches along with scapular and posterior cuff 
strengthening.22  Lynch et al implemented a self-stretching program using chin tucks, a pectoral 
stretch over a foam roller, and a strengthening program for the serratus anterior and lower/middle 
trapezius.23  In addition to improving posture, 79% of the latt er study’s  intervention group 
experienced significant reduction in shoulder pain or were pain free post intervention.23  
“Investigation of In-Water and Dry Land Training Programs for Competitive Swimmers in the United States ” by Tate A et al.

According to our survey, less than 10% of swimmers perform chin tucks and less than 20% 
perform the foam roller stretch, although other pectoral stretches were frequently used.  Except 
for college teams, less than one half of respondents perform scapular strengthening such as the 
“T” and “Y” exercises, and few teams perform external rotation (posterior cuff) strengthening at 
90 degrees.  Rotator cuff strengthening is indicated to center the humeral head in the glenoid 
fossa during arm elevation and is considered an essential component of conservative 
management for shoulder impingement.27  Posterior rotator cuff strengthening at multiple angles, 
including at 90 degrees elevation which is mid pull for freestyle, has specifically been 
recommended in a protocol for swimmer ’s shoulder.1  
With respect to strengthening, our survey revealed that the most frequently reported 
method of determining resistance was to have the swimmer choose their own weight, which may 
put them at risk of injury if the weight chosen exceeds the swimmer’s capacity or may produce 
less than optimal results i f too little resistance is used.  The American College of Sports 
Medicine advocates the use of repetition maximum testing as the most effective way to strength 
train.28  However, less than 41% of respondents from each of our groups select the amount of 
resistance based on repetition maximum testing.   
Consistent with findings in other athletes performing repetitive overhead activity, 
reduced internal rotation range of motion (ROM) has been reported in competitive 
swimmers.29,30  Reduced internal rotation is a measure of posterior shoulder tightness, which has 
been shown to cause anterior and superior translation of the humeral head and therefore could 
contribute to shoulder impingement.31  Respondents report ed using cross body adduction 
frequently and the sleeper stretch infrequently, to target posterior shoulder tightness.  Use of the 
sidelying sleeper stretch has been reported to more effectively stabilize the scapula to better 
“Investigation of In-Water and Dry Land Training Programs for Competitive Swimmers in the United States ” by Tate A et al.

isolate the posterior glenohumeral tissues 32, so this method may be more effective in swimmers 
who typically exhibit elongated scapular retractors but studies comparing these exercises in 
swimmers are lacking .  Although some respondents reported using rapid arm circles, partner 
pectoral stretches, and wall stretches (titled latissimus dorsi stretches on our survey), these 
exercises may place the glenohumeral joint in extreme positions which exceed normal joint 
ROM and  maystress on the anterior capsule which is often lax in swimmers.  Overstretching of 
non-contractile tissues may increase the risk for instability and injury.2  
As can be seen from the previously cited research, stretching should be performed 
selectively for structures typically found to be restricted in competitive swimmers, namely the 
pectoralis minor, posterior shoulder, and cervical musculature contributing to a forward head 
posture.  Although most respondents engage in stretching, the stretching dosage utilized may not 
be optimal to effect changes in tissue length.  Over half of swimmers perform the recommended 
2 to 3 repetitions, but less than 7% of respondents hold stretches for 30 seconds or longer which 
has been shown to effect significant changes in resting shoulder posture in elite high school and 
college swimmers22 and in scapular position in healthy persons with moderate forward head and 
rounded shoulder posture.33 One study also measured pectoral length directly.  Williams et al34 
passively applied 2 repetitions of 30 second stretches into shoulder horizontal abduction in 
collegiate swimmers and found increases in pectoralis minor length compared to the control 
shoulder.  In contrast, Wang and colleagues saw no changes using a 10 second stretching 
interval.35  Based on available research, 2 to 3 repetitions of 30-second hold times effect changes 
in tissue length and currently reported dosages for pectoral stretching may not be adequate.   
A variety of cross training techniques were used by our respondents to supplement 
swimming workouts with running, cycling, and yoga used most frequently.  Wetzler and 
“Investigation of In-Water and Dry Land Training Programs for Competitive Swimmers in the United States ” by Tate A et al.  
Journal of Sport Rehabilitation

colleagues hypothesized that cross training can relieve stress on injured areas and strengthen 
muscles not used in swimming to help maintain cardiovascular fitness, muscle strength, and 
muscular endurance all leading to a higher likelihood of injury prevention.36  Consistent with 
this, youth and masters level competitive swimmers that engaged in cross training had less 
shoulder pain and disability than their counterparts who were not engaged in these additional 
modes of training.5  Auvien and colleagues concluded that adolescent swimmers who 
participated in several cross training activities over the year were less likely to develop neck, 
shoulder, and low back pain.37  They hypothesized that cross training likely improved the trunk 
muscular endurance and strength, along with the overall fitness of swimmers, leading to a 
decreased rate of injury in swimmers surveyed.37    
Strong core stability has been linked to the maximal production, transfer, and control of 
force and motion to terminal segments in athletes along with minimizing joint loads in a variety 
of activities.38  The core musculature has been described a box consisting of 29 paired muscles 
encompassing the abdominals anteriorly, the paraspinals and gluteals posteriorly, the diaphragm 
superiorly, and the pelvic floor and hip girdle musculature inferiorly.39  Core musculature 
weakness and lack of coordination have been associated with less efficient movements, 
compensatory movement patterns, muscle strains, muscle overuse, and injury.  40   Although cross 
training has been shown to be beneficial in cycling and running performance41and the theoretical 
basis for use of cross training and core stability appear sound, the effects on swimming 
performance or injury prevention have yet to be determined prospectively.  
Limitations 
Several limitations were identified for this study.  Data was obtained from a sample of 
convenience of those swimmers and coaches who had access to the study information document 
“Investigation of In-Water and Dry Land Training Programs for Competitive Swimmers in the United States ” by Tate A et al.  
Journal of Sport Rehabilitation

and desired to participate so it may not be representative of all coaches and masters swimmers.  
Choices provided in the survey for strengthening, stretching, and cross training exercises were 
based on exercises reported in the literature and use d by the study’s authors who were 
competitive swimmers so they may not reflect the training practices of all coaches or masters 
swimmers.  In order to capture additional responses, participants were permitted to write in 
responses which were analyzed collectively as “other.”  
CONCLUSION 
Our survey has identified that a variety of training methods are used by coaches of youth, 
high school, and college teams and by masters swimmers.  The authors are not aware of prior 
studies encompassing both the in-water and dry land practices of competitive swimmers across 
the United States.  In attempting to reduce the high prevalence of shoulder pain occurring in 
these athletes, our study represents an initial step in identifying potential areas of in-water and 
dry land training that may not address postural changes inherent to competitive swimmers or that 
may have potentially adverse effects on their shoulders.   
Among in water practices, kicking drills are frequently used but the sustained and 
extreme shoulder positioning in several methods may contribute to pain or pathology.  The mean 
yardage swum at both the high school and college levels was also identified as placing swimmers 
at higher risk for shoulder pain and supraspinatus tendinopathy.  Regarding dry land training, 
stretching and strengthening exercises and dosages commonly utilized were inconsistent with 
current research recommendations and lacked specificity in terms of addressing typical mobility 
restrictions and muscle weaknesses described in the swimming literature.  Cross training and 
core strengthening appear to have sound theoretical bases but the efficacy of these methods for

performance enhancement and injury prevention in swimmers has not been established and 
requires further research.
