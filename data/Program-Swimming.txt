 The Power Plate integrated p rograms are intended for the performance coach working to 
maximize results for swimmers  of all levels .  Swim mers must tolerate a high volume of water work 
specific  to each event , making weight bearing resistance training, mobility, and recovery work critical 
for performance enhancement and injury prevention . Olympic swimming events currently consist of 32 
events, including both individual & team of varying distances .  
 The performance coach can manipulate the volume and inten sity of the Power Plate Prepare, 
Perform, and Recover  programs contained in this manual according to the event (s), season,  and 
individual needs of the athlete.  Coach es should use their professional discretion, education, and 
experience when integrating Power Plate  training into  the swimmer’s  program . These p rograms are 
meant to provide  guidelines based on the latest research and application of integrated Power Plate  
training .

Figure 1: Suggested time line for recovery methods in soccer. Active recovery, whole -body vibration, and cold water immersion  
should be implemented progressively immediately after the match or training, and due to the needs o f space and  
resources, these recovery strategies should be performed in the sports facility itself. Neuromuscular electrical stimulation  
and compression garments could be applied during the trip back home after the game or training or at the player’s  
home (Rey, Padron -Cabo, Barcala -Furelos, Casamichana, & Romo -Perez, 2016).

Performance Needs Analysis : Swimming  
• Events Overview : Individual and relay  Olympic swimming events can vary from shorter sprints ( 50-100-m), to moderate 
distances (200 , 400, & 8 00-m), along with the endurance dominant (10-k).  Events consist of one or a combination (medleys) of 
crawling or “freestyle”, butterfly, backstroke, & breaststroke (https://www.olympic.org/swimming ).  
• Common Injuries:  Non-specific shoulder pain or “swimmer’s shoulder” has been shown to be experienced by up to 90% of 
competitive swimmers at some point who spend more than 12 hours per week in the water (Bradley, Kerr, Bowmaker, & Gomez,  
2019).  
• Multi -directional Agility & Quickness Demands:  Although land based SAQ is not directly sports specifi c to swimming , agility 
(closed loop) and quickness (open loop)  multi -directional drills  can be used as a cross -training tool in the off -season to improve 
overall athleticism and reduce injury risk by exposing the swimmer  to more ground reaction force s (GRF)  than water training 
provides.    
• Linear Acceleration  Dem ands: As with SAQ,  linear acceleration training does not have a high priority in a swim training 
program.  Swimmers could benefit from a periodized program that incorporates a small amount of linear acceleration training 
during the offseason or cross -training periods to expose the athlete to increased GRF’s which can improve power output from the 
starting block & turns (see Power Demands below) along with r educ ing risk of injury .   
• Absolute Speed Demands:  As with SAQ & linear a cceleration training, a significant amount absolute speed training may not 
need to be included in a swimmers training program unless it is for cross -training purposes.  
• Mobility Demands: Optimal mobility of the cervical spine, shoulder , thoracic spine, and hip i n all three planes of motions is 
needed to prevent compensatory movement that can lead to injury  for all swimming strokes . Movement preparation and/or 
recovery on the Power Plate  using the programs in this manual are inten ded to aid in reducing risk of these injuries.  
• Stabilization Demands: In addition to mobility of the above segments, stability of all of these joints is also needed to prevent 
compensatory movement that can lead to overuse injury  for the swimmer .  Low inte nsity  “prehab” or ‘activation”  movements can 
be implemented during Prepare  and/or Recover  periods  on the Power Plate  daily during all seasons of training .  
• Strength Demands:  Several studies have demonstrated that sport -speciﬁc strength training has contributed to improvements in 
shoulder health, strength, and power  (Monu,  2013). While a well -balanced strength program is recommended at varying volume 
and intensity year-round for the swimmer, special emphasis should be placed on the shoulder , scapular & thoracic spine muscles  
for injury prevention & performance enhancement ( Monu, 2013).  
• Power Demands:  For sprint swimmers, studies have shown a strong start can account for 30% of a 50 -m race and suggest that a 
strong dive is essential to maximize performance (Bishop, et al., 2013). Plyometric  training  has been shown to provide  a mean  
reduction  of 0.59 se c. in start time  in swimmers , translating  to a signiﬁcant  improvement  in start performance  (Bishop, et al., 
2013).  Power Plate  training has been shown to improve explosive strength endurance by 7.8% (30 -s of counter movement 
jumps) over a six -week period (Paradisis & Zacharogiannis, 2007). Impro ving power output can also help the middle & long -
distance swimmer to  sustain high power output if needed at the end of a race.   
• Core Strength Demands: Core specific movements  can be implemented in all phases of training to aid in postural endurance , 
reduce shoulder in jury risk, and improve force transfer  form upper to lower extremity  needed to optimize all swim strokes .   
• Energy System Demands  (ESD) : ESD training in or out  of wate r need to be customized to the specific events that the swimmer 
is preparing for . The 50 & 100 -m distance s will be more reliant on the ATP -CP followed by the glycolytic energy pathways .  The 
middle -distance events  (200-400-m) would primarily  rely on the glycolytic pathways while the longer distance events will 
primarily rely on the aerobic pathway relative to glycolytic and ATP -CP pa thways .  Land based ESD cross -training using 
different modalities at varying intensities  can aid in recovery and improve athleticism.    
• Common Athletic Profiling Tests:  Swimmers are an athlete population that has been found to be at greater risk of early 
specialization, where a bias is placed toward intensive  year-round  training  at the expen se of a more global movement skill s 
(Nugent, Comyns, & Warrington, 2018).  This makes global and local assessments such as the for the foot, ankle, hip, and 
shoulder criti cal for the swimmer’s program. Swim  specific performance assessments could  include the “streamline assessment” 
for shoulder overhead mobility , aerobic and/or anerobic tests in the water , and any lower body power testing for starts & turns .

Notes for Plyometric Circuit:  
• Program emphasis on explosive linear  acceleration for enhanced power on starts and turns  
• Power Plate Pre -Activation: 3 sets x :10 holds  
• Work -Rest ratio following circuit is 1 : 5  
• Reduce volume by cutting MB throws & foot contacts by 50% in season or during periods of  high volume of swim  training  
• Frequency: 1-2 days per week (off -season); 0-1 days per week (in -season)  
• *Front leg on Power Plate  
• ***Stick & hold landing 1 second then repeat

Notes:  
• Decrease volume (sets) in season or during periods of high volume of swimming  
• Can be done 1 -3x per week as to increase core strength/endurance  
• Load: % of estimated 1RM  
• *PROmotion Cables or Straps  
• ** Athlete holds band overhead w/both hands; Partner provides low to moderate anterior & posterior force 
by pulling on band as athlete resists  
• ***Mini -Band on wrists (Pull band apart)

Notes:  
• Can be used as movement preparation or as recovery program  
• Increase volume (Duration & Sets) before increasing load (frequency & amplitude) to progress  
• Intensity should be kept low to moderate with focus on quality or quantity of movement  
• *Athlete holds band overhead  w/both hands; Partner provides low to moderate  anterior & posterior  force by pulling on 
band as athlete resists
