punt Sport, Beweging en Gezondheid.
Background: An important aspect in competitive swimming
is the risk of injuries, which affects the performance of the
athlete.[2] Several studies already discussed this risk.[1,4]
Nevertheless, few clinical epidemiological studies provide
a complete overview of all the injuries in competitive swim-
ming.[1] In Flanders there are no data available on swim-
ming injuries. The purpose of this study was to register
injuries sustained in competitive swimming in Flanders.
Methods: One hundred and nine Flemish competitive
swimmers (57 male, 52 female) were prospectively followed
for both acute and overuse injuries during one year. Injuries
were registered with the Blits R/circlecopyrtOnline Injury Diary. Expo-
sure was measured by weekly exposure sheets; and injury
incidence rate was expressed per 1000h. For the statistical
analyses 95% conﬁdence intervals (CI) and the relative risk
were calculated. The One-Sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov
test, Mann-Whitney-U test and Independent-Samples t-test
were also used (p<0.05).
Results: Ninety-nine subjects completed the study, of
which 60,6% sustained 1 or more injury. We found an in-
cidence of 2.67 injuries/1000h [95%CI: 2.13–3.22] during
the one-year period. Acute injuries (1.05 injuries/1000h
[95%CI: 0.70–1.39]) were signiﬁcantly more often caused
by other sports than swim training itself. The age cate-
gory ’17-18 years’ had a signiﬁcantly higher risk of acute
injuries compared to the ’15-16 years’. The risk for a shoul-
der overuse injury was signiﬁcantly higher compared to all
other overuse injuries (1.63 injuries/1000h [95%CI: 1.20-
2.05]). The ’muscle-tendon’ complex was signiﬁcantly more
often injured compared to the bone, the joint, the nerve or
the bursa. Age, weight, height, BMI and exposure did not
differ signiﬁcantly between athletes with or without shoulder
injuries.
Conclusions: These are the ﬁrst available data that give
an overview of both acute and overuse injury incidence
of competitive swimming in Flanders. Injury incidence
was comparable with the results of McFarland & Wasik.[3]
Shoulder injuries are the most frequently seen, probably as
a result of repetitive overload of muscle and tendon.[5]
Further research is needed to determine speciﬁc risk fac-
tors and prescribe effective preventive measures in com-
petitive swimming.
