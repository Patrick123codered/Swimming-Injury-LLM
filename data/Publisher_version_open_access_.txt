Therapeutic exercise ABSTRACT  
Background: Guidelines recommend exercise for treatment of chronic low back pain and prevention, but the 
amount and quality of evidence for different exercise modes is highly variable. Swimming is commonly rec-
ommended by health professionals, but the extent and quality of research supporting its relationship with back 
pain is not clear. 
Objectives: The aim of this scoping review was to map the extent, characteristics and findings of research 
investigating the relationship between swimming and low back pain. 
Design: Scoping review. 
Method: Four electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and SPORT Discus) were searched from 
inception to February 2023. We included primary studies and reviews that reported an association between 
swimming and low back pain. Hydrotherapy studies were excluded. 
Results: 3093 articles were identified, and 44 studies included. Only one randomised controlled trial and one 
longitudinal cohort study were included. Most studies were cross-sectional (37/44; 84.1%), included competitive 
athletes (23/39; 59.0%), and did not primarily focus on the association between swimming and low back pain in 
the aims (41/44; 93.2%). Instead, most data available were largely incidentally collected or a secondary 
outcome. The reported associations between swimming and low back pain were highly variable regardless of 
whether the comparison was to other sports (odds ratio: 0.17 to 17.92) or no sport (odds ratio: 0.54 to 3.01). 
Conclusion: Most available literature investigating swimming and low back pain is cross-sectional in design. We 
did not identify any clear pattern of association between swimming and low back pain, based on the available 
literature.   
1.Introduction 
Low back pain (LBP) is the most common non-communicable disease 
and the leading cause of disability globally (Hartvigsen et al., 2018 ). 
Estimates of the lifetime prevalence of LBP in the general and athletic 
populations are up to 84% and 94%, respectively (Hoy et al., 2012 ; 
Trompeter et al., 2017 ). Recurrence of LBP is common with 70% of these 
people experiencing a recurrence within the following 12 months of 
recovering from an episode (da Silva et al., 2019 ). Chronic LBP is the 
primary cause of healthcare costs and lost working hours (Foster et al., 
2018 ; Buchbinder et al., 2018 ). Current guidelines recommend exercise 
as one of the most effective treatments for chronic LBP and for pre-
venting recurrences (Foster et al., 2018 ; Chou et al., 2007 ). But, the 
amount and quality of evidence for different exercise modes is highly variable (Hayden et al., 2021 ). 
Swimming appears to be a suitable exercise for LBP, being one of the 
most common forms of exercise, relatively low cost, and easily acces -
sible. It is also a credible method to improve strength and range of 
motion, while producing low axial loads on the spine (Chase et al., 
2008 ). Considering this, it is unsurprising that anecdotally some health 
professionals recommend swimming for patients with LBP (Zandwijk 
et al., 2018 ). However, there is limited research available on the effec-
tiveness of swimming for LBP. A 2022 systematic review of randomised 
controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the effectiveness of walking, 
swimming or cycling for LBP found only one small trial that assessed the 
effectiveness of swimming as treatment and no trials investigated pre-
vention (Pocovi et al., 2022 ). There is a need to review a wider range of 
research designs, beyond RCTs, to provide insight on the association

2between swimming and LBP. 
A few previous systematic reviews briefly comment on the associa -
tion between swimming and LBP, but none had a focus on this topic. 
They included designs other than RCTs, but none summarized the as-
sociation between swimming and LBP (e.g. odds ratios) or the key design 
elements of the included studies (Farahbakhsh et al., 2018 ; Gaunt and 
Maffulli, 2012 ; Hill et al., 2022 ; Ribaud et al., 2013 ). Therefore, the 
extent of research investigating the association between swimming and 
LBP, including what study designs, populations, controls and outcome 
measures are used, has not yet been thoroughly reviewed. This infor-
mation can optimise clinicians understanding of the relationship be-
tween swimming and LBP, and inform future research efforts in this 
area, which is important given the investigation of swimming as a 
treatment or prevention strategy for LBP is in its infancy. 
Scoping reviews use an explorative approach to synthesize research 
evidence to map the nature, volume and trends of the existing literature 
(Peters et al., 2015 ; Levac et al., 2010 ; Arksey and O’Malley, 2005 ). 
Given the potential benefit of swimming on improving pain and func-
tion, the wide use of exercise for the prevention and treatment of LBP, 
anecdotal evidence for an already existing culture of health pro-
fessionals recommending swimming for LBP, and the lack of existing 
reviews focusing on the topic, there is a clear need for a scoping review 
this topic. 
The primary aim of this scoping review was to map the extent and 
characteristics of research investigating the relationship between 
swimming and low back pain. We also aimed to summarize the reported 
relationships between swimming and LBP and identify research gaps 
and key research priorities. 
2.Materials and methods 
This scoping review was guided by the methodological framework 
developed by Arksey and O’Malley (2005) and the adaptations recom -
mended by Levac et al. (2010) and the Joanna Briggs Institute (Peters 
et al., 2015 ). The review adheres to the Preferred Reporting Items for 
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews 
(PRISMA-ScR) Checklist (Tricco et al., 2018 ). The review protocol was 
prospectively registered on Open Science Framework: https://doi.org/ 
10.17605/OSF.IO/USWEA . 
2.1. Data sources and searches 
MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and SPORT Discus were searched from 
inception to the February 22, 2023. The complete search strategy is 
included in Appendix A. Forward and backward citation searching were 
completed to identify additional studies that may have not been detec -
ted by the primary searches. 
We included studies that reported a quantitative measure of the 
effectiveness of swimming for treatment or prevention of LBP, or the 
association between swimming and LBP (e.g., mean difference, odds 
ratio [OR], risk ratio), or data enabling this to be calculated. Studies 
were required to include human participants, of any age with or without 
existing LBP. Studies were required to include groups of participants 
that were exposed to swimming or received a swimming intervention as 
a primary component (i.e more than 50% of the exercise); a comparison 
group that was not exposed to swimming or were exposed to an alter-
native swimming intervention (e.g., different volumes or different 
strokes); and report on a LBP related outcome including pain prevalence, 
pain intensity, physical functioning or disability, work productivity, or 
lumbar spine pathology (e.g., imaging measures of disc degeneration). 
Swimming was defined as actively propelling the body through the 
water. All strokes of swimming were considered. 
All articles included were full-length, peer-reviewed papers, and 
published in any language, as long as English translation was available. 
Study designs included primary research studies (e.g., cross-sectional, 
longitudinal and RCTs), reviews and meta-analyses. We excluded case studies, opinion pieces, qualitative studies and 
guidelines. We also excluded studies investigating general water activ-
ity, including hydrotherapy, water running and aqua aerobics. 
2.2. Study selection 
A pool of five researchers contributed to the study selection process. 
Two researchers independently reviewed the titles and abstracts of the 
identified studies. Full texts were then obtained for all potentially 
included studies and independently assessed against the eligibility 
criteria. Any discrepancies were settled by discussion between the two 
involved reviewers or discussed amongst the entire research team if a 
consensus was not reached by the initial two researchers. Non-English 
texts were translated using Google Translate before undergoing review. 
2.3. Data extraction 
Our data extraction form was modelled on the Joanna Briggs Insti-
tute recommendations for scoping reviews (Peters et al., 2015 ). One 
researcher completed the initial data extraction for each included study. 
A second researcher independently checked these data to ensure accu-
racy. Any discrepancies were resolved through discussion between re-
searchers. We completed regular meetings to discuss and agree upon 
iterative updates to the data extraction form based on pilot testing. 
We extracted data on study characteristics (author, publication year, 
study design), population characteristics (age, sex, current LBP or no 
pain, competitive or non-competitive swimmer), swimming exposure 
(frequency, distance, swim stroke; defined as adequate and inadequate if 
duration of swimming was specified or not), pool setting (indoor or 
outdoor swimming, pool temperature, supervision levels), comparator 
or control type, back pain related outcome measures and results of 
relevant statistical analysis of association. The study design was deter -
mined based on the nature of the study results related to our research 
question. For example, if a longitudinal study only reported an associ -
ation between swimming and LBP at baseline it was categorised as cross- 
sectional. Populations were determined to be competitive swimmers 
(specified as an athlete or competing in any level of competition) or non- 
competitive swimmers. 
If sufficient raw data were available, we extracted 2 ×2 data 
enabling us to calculate OR. If raw data were not available, we extracted 
the least adjusted results (ORs if available) to maximise the extent to 
which they could be compared with manually calculated ORs from other 
studies. 
2.4. Data synthesis and analysis 
Results were summarized descriptively and presented in tables and 
figures. Tables summarized all studies presenting quantitative compar -
isons between swimming and comparisons. Agreement between authors 
for study selection was calculated using MedCalc inter-rater agreement 
(MedCalc Software, Ostend, Belgium) (Inter-rater Agreement, 2024 ). 
The associations between swimming and LBP were reported separately 
based on study design (RCTs, longitudinal studies and cross-sectional 
studies) and for competitive and non-competitive populations. 
ORs with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and p-values were calculated 
using an online statistical calculator (Select Statistical Services) (Odds 
Ratio – Confidence Interval, 2023 ) for studies that reported raw 2 ×2 
data. Modified Haldane-Anscombe corrections (adding 1/2 to all cells) 
were made for any studies where a zero score was present in the 2 ×2 
data. Effect size precision and level of certainty were based on assessing 
the 95% CI width. Thresholds for increased OR were considered small 
(1.68 –3.47), medium (3.47 –6.71) and large (F6.71) and decreased ORs 
were considered small (0.59 –0.29), medium (0.29 –0.15) and large 
(D0.15). (Chen et al., 2010 ). 
Mean differences were calculated using raw mean ±standard devi-
ation scores, using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis Software, Version 4 D.M. Wareham et al.

Results were presented as mean difference between swimming and a 
comparator with 95% confidence intervals. Data were coded and re-
ported so that positive mean differences indicated better outcomes in 
swimmers compared to the comparison group. 
2.5. Patient and public involvement 
Physiotherapists, researchers, and consumers with LBP were 
involved in the final interpretation and dissemination of results. These 
individuals were identified through our research team ’s contact 
network. We provided a draft manuscript and asked for input on what they felt was most helpful to their understanding of the topic, what as-
pects could be improved to enhance clarity and relevance, and any other 
suggestions. We offered the option of providing feedback via an online 
meeting or in written form. All consumers chose a written format. Based 
on feedback, minor adjustments were made to the manuscript to 
improve clarity. All feedback supported the importance of investigating 
the association between swimming and LBP, considering that it is an 
already widely used and recommended mode of exercise.

43.Results 
3.1. Search results 
A total of 3093 studies were identified via the electronic search. 44 
studies met all inclusion criteria and were included (Fig. 1). A detailed 
summary of each individual study is available in Appendix B. There was 
a substantial level of agreement between two independent raters when 
screening full texts (Kappa [95% CI] 0.66 [0.53 to 0.80]) (Landis and 
Koch, 1977 ). One study appeared to meet our inclusion criteria based on 
the abstract, but despite multiple attempts to contact the author, 
collaboration with academic librarians and consultation with a database 
of the local district, the full text was unable to be retrieved and no data 
was extracted or included in our results (Torii, 2005 ). 
3.2. Description of all studies 
Table 1 demonstrates the number and percentage of studies for all study designs, as well as the number and percentage of primary studies 
for descriptions of participants, swimming exposure, comparison group 
and LBP outcome measure. Research was conducted across 17 different 
countries, with a progressive increase in the number of published studies 
over time. 
3.2.1. Study design 
Most included studies were cross-sectional study designs (37/44; 
84.1%). Only one RCT and one longitudinal cohort study were included 
(Weifen et al., 2013 ; Mueller et al., 2016 ). We also identified 5 sys-
tematic reviews (Pocovi et al., 2022 ; Farahbakhsh et al., 2018 ; Gaunt 
and Maffulli, 2012 ; Hill et al., 2022 ; Ribaud et al., 2013 ). Of these, one 
included RCTs only (reporting on the same single RCT we identified ), 
(Pocovi et al., 2022 ) and one included cross-sectional studies only, 
(Farahbakhsh et al., 2018 ) and three included all types of primary 
studies (Gaunt and Maffulli, 2012 ; Hill et al., 2022 ; Ribaud et al., 2013 ). 
Primary studies and reviews rarely focused on the relationship be-
tween swimming and LBP as the primary aim of the study. Only three 
studies aims explicitly included “swimming ” and a variation of “LBP” in 
their aims (6.8%) (Pocovi et al., 2022 ; Folkvardsen et al., 2016 ; Mutoh, 
1977 ). In comparison, the aims of thirteen studies did not include 
“swimming ” or any variations of “LBP” (29.5%), (Ariyoshi et al., 1999 ; 
Hangai et al., 2009 ; Iwamoto et al., 2008 .; Mundt et al., 1993 ; Owen 
et al., 2020 ; Øyen et al., 2009 ; Ristolainen et al., 2010 ; Ruddick et al., 
2019 ; Sheehy et al., 2022 ; Suri et al., 2015 ; Takatalo et al., 2017 ; 
Trompeter et al., 2018 ; Bartolozzi et al., 1991 ) ten studies included 
“swimming ” but not any variations of “LBP” (22.7%), (Gaunt and Maf-
fulli, 2012 ; Hill et al., 2022 ; Capaci et al., 2002 ; Gębska et al., 2016 ; 
Kaneoka et al., 2007 ; Martins et al., 2014 ; Matsuura et al., 2019 ; Mohsen 
et al., 2012 ; Zaina et al., 2015 ; Knobloch et al., 2008 ) and eighteen 
studies included a variation of “LBP” but not “swimming ” in the aims 
(40.9%) (Farahbakhsh et al., 2018 ; Ribaud et al., 2013 ; Weifen et al., 
2013 ; Mueller et al., 2016 ; Auvinen et al., 2008 ; Goldstein et al., 1991 ; 
Harreby et al., 1997 ; Muller et al., 2017 ;Kaartinen et al., 2020 ; Kovacs 
et al., 2003 ; Masiero et al., 2008 ; Mogensen et al., 2007 ; Noormo -
hammadpour et al., 2016 ; Sjolie, 2004 ; Skoffer et al., 2008 ; Sundell 
et al., 2019 ; Sato et al., 2011 ; Lively, 2002 ). Most data we included was 
secondary or incidental data relevant to our research question (Avail -
able in Appendix B). 
3.3. Description of primary studies 
3.3.1. Participants 
Over half of the included primary studies reported on competitive 
swimmers (23/39; 58.9%). Definitions of competitive swimmers varied 
greatly between studies, ranging from membership in a swimming club 
to competing in the 2016 Rio Olympics. However, studies reporting on 
non-competitive swimmers had considerably larger sample sizes, total-
ling 82.9% of the total participants in primary studies (60,027/72,406). 
Half of the included primary studies described young adults (aged 
18–29 years) as the primary age group (20/39; 51.3%). But across all 
studies, adolescents (aged 12–17 years) had a larger sample size, total-
ling 62.7% of all participants in primary studies (45,446/72,406). In 
comparison, only five studies assessed an adult population (aged 30–59 
years) as the primary age group (5/39; 12.8%) with a total of 14,134 
participants (19.5%). No studies described children (aged under 12 
years) or older adults (aged 60 years and over) as the primary age group. 
3.3.2. Swimming exposure 
Reports of the amount of exposure to swimming were mostly inad-
equate. Only fourteen studies reported the duration of swimming 
exposure of participants (36.0%) and only five studies reported the swim 
stroke used by participants (12.8%). No studies reported on the pool 
setting, level of supervision or swimming intensity. Table 1

53.3.3. Comparison 
Swimming was most frequently compared to other sports (23/39; 
59.0%). Comparison sports ranged from a single sport to over twenty 
different comparison sports combined, with no consistent comparison 
sport used throughout studies. Few studies contained a no-exercise 
comparison (8/39; 20.5%). In five studies the comparison was unclear 
(12.8%). 
3.3.4. LBP outcome measures 
LBP was measured using a wide range of clinician-reported and self- 
report outcome measures and imaging findings (Table 1). Most studies 
reported on LBP prevalence outcomes, reported as count and percentage 
(29/39; 74.4%). Of the studies reporting low back prevalence, most did 
not define LBP (19/29; 65.5%), and of those that did, only two specified 
the location of pain (between the last rib and lower gluteal fold) 
(Noormohammadpour et al., 2016 ; Sjolie, 2004 ). The time periods used 
to determine the prevalence of LBP also varied widely from point 
prevalence to lifetime prevalence. Imaging outcomes were reported in 
twelve studies (31.0%), most commonly reporting on the presence of 
disc degeneration and spondylosis. Only the single RCT assessed pain 
intensity using the Visual Analogue Scale as an outcome measure 
(Weifen et al., 2013 ). 
3.4. Effectiveness of swimming for LBP 
3.4.1. RCTs 
One RCT (n 320) that investigated the effectiveness of Tai Chi for 
the treatment of LBP provided data on the effect of swimming, which 
was one of 4 control groups (swimming n 38) (Weifen et al., 2013 ). 
The other comparison groups were no regular sports, jogging and 
backwards walking (combined n 141). Participants were retired ath-
letes with an average age of 38 years. Pain intensity was reported in 
terms of Visual Analogue Scale (VAS, 0–100). Participants were retired 
athletes with an average age of 38 years. Swimming demonstrated a 
reduction of pain compared to no regular sport, jogging and backwards 
walking at 3 months (VAS [95% CI] 8.0 [6.3 to 9.7], 5.7 [4.1 to 7.3], and 
4.9 [3.3 to 6.5], respectively) and 6 months follow up (VAS [95% CI] 8.1 
[6.6 to 9.6], 6.3 [4.9 to 7.7], and 4.9 [3.5 to 6.3], respectively). There 
was no significant difference in pain outcomes between swimming and 
Tai Chi at 3 months (VAS [95% CI]  1.0 [ 2.2 to 0.2]) and Tai Chi was 
superior to swimming at 6 months (VAS [95% CI]  1.8 [ 2.7 to  0.9]). 
3.4.2. Longitudinal observational study 
One longitudinal study suggested that 2 years of swimming may 
reduce the risk of reporting LBP in the previous 7 days amongst an 
adolescent population at a sports high school (OR [95% CI]: 0.55 [0.07 
to 4.29]); however, estimates are very imprecise based on the wide 
confidence intervals which extend into beneficial and detrimental effect 
estimate ranges (Mueller et al., 2016 ). 
3.5. Associations between swimming and LBP 
3.5.1. Cross-sectional studies 
Of the total 37 cross-sectional studies, 24 compared swimming to 
other sports or no sports (7 reporting non-competitive populations and 
17 reporting competitive populations) (Farahbakhsh et al., 2018 ; Folk-
vardsen et al., 2016 ; Hangai et al., 2009 ; Iwamoto et al., 2008 Owen 
et al., 2020 ; Ristolainen et al., 2010 ; Ruddick et al., 2019 ; Sheehy et al., 
2022: Trompeter et al., 2018 ; Bartolozzi et al., 1991 ; Gębska et al., 2016 ; 
Zaina et al., 2015; Knobloch et al., 2008 ; Goldstein et al., 1991 ; Harreby 
et al., 1997 ; Masiero et al., 2008 ; Mogensen et al., 2007 ; Noormo -
hammadpour et al., 2016 ; Skoffer et al., 2008 ; Sundell et al., 2019 ; Sato 
et al., 2011 ; Lively, 2002 ; Muller et al., 2017 ; Abdalkader et al., 2020 ). 
Of the studies comparing other sports or no sports, 23 studies provided 
data enabling us to calculate ORs or directly reported ORs we could use 
(Fig. 2) (Farahbakhsh et al., 2018 ;Folkvardsen et al., 2016 ; Hangai et al., 2009 ; Iwamoto et al., 2008 Owen et al., 2020 ; Ristolainen et al., 2010 ; 
Sheehy et al., 2022; Trompeter et al., 2018 ; Bartolozzi et al., 1991 ; 
Gębska et al., 2016 ; Goldstein et al., 1991 ;Zaina et al., 2015 ;Knobloch 
et al., 2008 Noormohammadpour et al., 2016 ;Harreby et al., 1997 ; 
Masiero et al., 2008 ; Lively, 2002 ; Skoffer et al., 2008 ; Sato et al., 2011 ; 
Sundell et al., 2019 ;Muller et al., 2017 ;Mogensen et al., 2007 ; Abdal -
kader et al., 2020 ). Compared to other sports and no sports, both 
competitive and non-competitive swimming populations demonstrated 
a mix of increased and decreased risk of LBP across different studies. 
Point estimates of ORs spread over a wide range of positive and negative 
associations (from 0.20 to 17.92), but most point estimates reported 
suggested small associations or less (ORs from 0.53 to 2.11) with larger 
studies only reporting less than small associations (ORs from 0.64 to 
1.40). Most confidence intervals were wide and included both positive 
and negative association values that were of potentially important 
magnitude. 
Six cross-sectional studies reported on the difference between com-
mon swimming strokes (freestyle, breaststroke, backstroke, and butter -
fly) (Mutoh, 1977 ; Capaci et al., 2002 ; Martins et al., 2014 ; Matsuura 
et al., 2019 ; Mohsen et al., 2012 ; Knobloch et al., 2008 ). When 
compared to other strokes, point estimates of ORs suggest that freestyle 
may be associated with less LBP (range from 0.04 to 0.74 across studies), 
while breaststroke may be associated with more LBP (range from 1.11 to 
1.37 across studies). Both backstroke and butterfly demonstrated a mix 
of positive and negative associations, according to point estimates. 
However, for all swimming strokes nearly all confidence intervals were 
wide and included both positive and negative associations that were of 
potentially important magnitude (Appendix C). 
4.Discussion 
We found a lack of high-level evidence investigating swimming as a 
treatment or prevention strategy for LBP. There is only one published 
RCT investigating swimming for LBP, and in this trial, swimming was 
used as one of four small comparison groups for Tai Chi, which was the 
primary intervention being investigated. In contrast, we identified a 
large number of cross-sectional studies that reported some data on 
swimming and LBP, usually as part of broader research related to 
physical activity and health. The lack of primary focus on the association 
of swimming and LBP in these studies resulted in poorly defined 
swimming exposure data and LBP outcomes. So while we could extract 
measures of association, caution is required when interpreting them. 
Most cross-sectional studies included young adult populations or 
competitive swimmers. Very few studies provided data on comparisons 
of swimming to no exposure group (i.e., no physical activity or no sport) 
and most provided data on comparison to multiple other sports. We did 
not find any clear pattern of association between swimming and LBP 
across the included studies. 
This is the first review to focus on synthesizing all available evidence 
on the association between swimming and LBP. We found four system -
atic reviews that incidentally reported on the association between 
swimming and LBP, with two reviews focused on swimming injuries 
(Gaunt and Maffulli, 2012 ; Hill et al., 2022 ) and two focused on LBP in 
sports (Farahbakhsh et al., 2018 ; Ribaud et al., 2013 ). Summaries of the 
relationship between swimming and LBP were consistently brief and 
reported on between three to eight studies per review. In contrast, our 
review had a search strategy that was optimised for investigating the 
association between swimming and LBP and identified 44 studies (F5 
times any of the previous reviews). As a result, our review provides a 
more expansive overview of the evidence reporting the effect and as-
sociation between swimming and LBP. This wider understanding allows 
for a more complete summary and more specific recommendations for 
future research. 
Our study demonstrates that most research related to LBP and 
swimming includes specific populations that may not generalise to many 
people who experience back pain. Over half of the included studies D.M. Wareham et al.

7focused on populations of competitive swimmers. Athletic populations 
are known to have a unique profile of LBP and to report a higher 
prevalence of LBP compared to the general population (Wilson et al., 
2021; Heneweer et al., 2009). Athletic populations are also most 
commonly young adults (Allen and Hopkins, 2015). As a result, our 
findings are best generalised to athletic populations who are an impor -
tant subgroup of LBP patients. However, common risk factors for 
disabling LBP (e.g., older age, high BMI and smoking) are rarely seen in 
athletic populations and a primary concern in research and policy is the 
rising levels of disability associated with LBP (Heneweer et al., 2009; 
Ferreira et al., 2023). Our study highlights the need for future research 
to investigate the relationship between swimming and LBP in pop-
ulations with risk factors (other than athletes) who likely contribute 
most to the huge societal burden associated with LBP. 
Our review demonstrates that current studies only allow for limited 
evidence appraisal and synthesis, secondary to insufficient descriptions 
of swimming dosage, unclear definitions of LBP and using a limited 
number of LBP outcomes. Key descriptions of swimming such as dura-
tion and swim stroke were infrequently included in most studies, while 
intensity and supervision levels were absent. These descriptions are 
more sparse than the average descriptions seen in exercise prescription 
studies, which are already noted to be insufficient for evidence synthesis 
and application to clinical practice (Hansford et al., 2022; Davidson 
et al., 2021). Furthermore, half of the included studies only reported on 
the prevalence of LBP as the LBP outcome, whereas most studies did not 
define how LBP was categorised. Exploring the association and effect of 
swimming on a wider range of important LBP-related outcomes is 
warranted. LBP is considered to be a complex multi-faceted disease, 
where it is important to measure a range of outcomes relating to 
disability, pain, psychological factors and healthcare costs (Hartvigsen 
et al., 2018). Consensus documents highlight the core LBP outcomes to 
include back-specific function, generic health status, pain, work 
disability, and patient satisfaction (Bombardier, 2000). The limitations 
in the reporting of swimming dosage, definition of LBP and outcomes 
used in the included studies are likely a result of most studies not 
focusing on the association between swimming and LBP as the primary 
objective. 
Although guidelines recommend exercise to treat and prevent LBP, 
(Foster et al., 2018) our study findings are unable to support or refute 
these recommendations for swimming specifically. There is only a single 
trial that assesses the effect, (Weifen et al., 2013) and no trials that assess 
swimming as a prevention strategy for LBP. The potential association 
between swimming and LBP is also unclear as the included 
cross-sectional studies contain significant limitations. Clinical hetero -
geneity is seen in the wide range of populations, comparisons, outcome 
measures and exposures to swimming. Only 18% of studies compared 
swimming to a no-exposure group, which would be ideal before 
comparing swimming to other sports or physical activities. Statistical 
heterogeneity is evidenced by the mix of positive and negative associ -
ations, many reported with great uncertainty (wide confidence in-
tervals). Our review highlights the urgent need for future research that 
explores the association or effect of swimming for LBP, especially given 
the apparent popularity of swimming amongst health professionals and 
patients and the potential benefits (Chase et al., 2008). Furthermore, 
future research may be warranted to investigate why there is a notice -
able lack of evidence addressing swimming and LBP, especially in light 
of widespread recommendations for exercise in managing LBP and the 
common use of swimming. 
4.1. Limitations 
We did not assess the quality of the included studies, as a formal 
assessment of quality is outside the scope of scoping reviews (Peters 
et al., 2015; Levac et al., 2010; Arksey and O’Malley, 2005). There is likely a mix of study quality across those included in this review, which 
has not been accounted for when reporting our review findings. Almost 
all included studies used a cross-sectional study design and our data 
extraction from these studies was often limited by unclear reporting of 
exposures and outcome measures. These study reporting issues likely 
reduce the quality of evidence available on the association between 
swimming and LBP. We also recognize the limitation of using Google 
Translate to aid data extraction from non-English texts. The use of 
Google Translate is recommended as a method to avoid bias that may 
result from only including English texts, however, it is recognized that 
this may not be as accurate as translation from a native speaker (Jackson 
et al., 2019). Additionally, only two studies required translation so this 
was unlikely to influence the overall review findings. 
4.2. Conclusion 
Our findings demonstrate the lack of RCTs investigating the effect of 
swimming on LBP but a relatively large number of cross-sectional 
studies with data on the association between swimming and LBP. Most 
current research reports on LBP prevalence, in populations of young 
adults or competitive swimmers, based on studies designed primarily for 
other purposes. It is not currently possible to draw any confident con-
clusions on the effectiveness of swimming as an intervention for LBP or 
the broad association between swimming and LBP.
