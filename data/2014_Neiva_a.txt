Abstract Warm-up before physical activity is commonly
accepted to be fundamental, and any priming practices are
usually thought to optimize performance. However, spe-ciﬁcally in swimming, studies on the effects of warm-up
are scarce, which may be due to the swimming pool
environment, which has a high temperature and humidity,and to the complexity of warm-up procedures. The purpose
of this study is to review and summarize the different
studies on how warming up affects swimming perfor-mance, and to develop recommendations for improving the
efﬁciency of warm-up before competition. Most of the
main proposed effects of warm-up, such as elevated coreand muscular temperatures, increased blood ﬂow and
oxygen delivery to muscle cells and higher efﬁciency of
muscle contractions, support the hypothesis that warm-upenhances performance. However, while many researchers
have reported improvements in performance after warm-
up, others have found no beneﬁts to warm-up. This lack ofconsensus emphasizes the need to evaluate the real effectsof warm-up and optimize its design. Little is known about
the effectiveness of warm-up in competitive swimming,
and the variety of warm-up methods and swimming eventsstudied makes it difﬁcult to compare the published con-
clusions about the role of warm-up in swimming. Recent
ﬁndings have shown that warm-up has a positive effect onthe swimmer’s performance, especially for distances
greater than 200 m. We recommend that swimmers warm-
up for a relatively moderate distance (between 1,000 and1,500 m) with a proper intensity (a brief approach to race
pace velocity) and recovery time sufﬁcient to prevent the
early onset of fatigue and to allow the restoration of energyreserves (8–20 min).
1 Introduction
Warm-up routines are common practice before training
and competition in almost every sport. For decades,practitioners have prescribed warm-ups to prevent inju-
ries [ 1] and enhance the performance [ 2] of their athletes.
The scientiﬁc community supports the use of warm-up,
which has been reported to increase muscle temperature,
stimulate the performance of muscle contraction,decrease the time to achieve peak tension and relaxation
[3], and reduce the viscous resistance of the muscles and
joints [ 4]. Additionally, the hyperthermia induced by
warm-up leads to vasodilatation and increased muscle
blood ﬂow, most likely resulting in optimized aerobic
function due to the higher oxygen consumption duringsubsequent tasks [ 5,6]. Febbraio et al. [ 7] suggested that
muscle temperature improves the efﬁciency of muscle
glycolysis and high-energy phosphate degradation duringexercise, which may be from increasing the dependence
on anaerobic metabolism. We hypothesize that priming H. P. Neiva /C1M. C. Marques /C1D. A. Marinho

procedures that increase the body temperature optimize
both aerobic and anaerobic metabolism in energy pro-
duction during exercise.
Published reports also claim that warming up via
physical activity might have some effects beyond the
temperature-related ones. Gray et al. [ 8] detected a lower
accumulation of muscle lactate during a 30 s sprint on acycle ergometer after active warm-up compared with pas-
sive warm-up, despite the same starting temperature con-
ditions. It was later conﬁrmed that physical activity
stimulates buffering capacity, maintaining the acid-base
balance of the body [ 9,10]. Theoretically, the increased
heart rate after active warm-up [ 7,11] and the higher
baseline oxygen consumption at the start of subsequent
practice improve oxygen delivery to the active muscles andpotentiate the aerobic energy system [ 12]. In addition,
heavy loading activities may induce high-frequency stim-
ulation of motor neurons [ 13] for several minutes after-
wards, and this enhanced motor neuron excitability can
result in a considerable improvement in power production
[14,15]. The movement required for activity also reduces
muscle stiffness [ 16] and increases the range of motion of
the muscles involved, possibly allowing for easier, more
efﬁcient action.
Recently, some concerns have been raised about the
effectiveness of the warm-up for enhancing athletic per-
formance and preventing injuries [ 17–19]. Improvements
in performance ranged from 1 to 20 % in sports such as
cycling [ 20] and running [ 21] as well as in speciﬁc activ-
ities such as vertical jumping [ 22]. Warm-up also helped
athletes in team sports; players were acutely ready to per-
form basketball, handball and baseball skills after warm-up
activities [ 23–25]. Nevertheless, in other cases, perfor-
mance was impaired after warm-up. The vertical jump
height and gymnastic technical leap performance were
decreased after static stretching exercises [ 26,27], running
performance was reduced after high-intensity warm-up
[21] or after a long rest period [ 11], and cycling perfor-
mance was impaired after cyclists performed their usuallylong warm-up [ 28].
Scientiﬁc research has not demonstrated the efﬁcacy of
warm-up. As a result, athletes and coaches design thewarm-up routines based on their individual experiences.
The combination of a large number of variables, the
complexity of their relationship (e.g. volume, intensityand recovery interval) and the lack of a standardized
warm-up complicate characterization of warm-up tech-
niques [ 29]. For example, there is no scientiﬁc evidence
of the effectiveness of warm-up in swimming, and
studies have shown ambiguous effects of warm-up on
swimming performance [ 30–33]. The variability of
research designs (e.g. protocols, outcomes selected,swimming events, and swimmers’ competitive level)
makes it difﬁcult to compare data. Therefore, the purpose
of the present review is to describe the effects of warm-
up in swimming performance and to recommend opti-
mized warm-up strategies.
2 Literature Search
The MEDLINE, Scielo, SPORTDiscus, ScienceDirect,
Scopus, Web of Science and Google Scholar databases
were searched for studies that were published from January1955 until May 2013 (including electronic publications that
were available ahead of print). This review includes studies
about the effects of warm-up on swimming performance,which were identiﬁed using the following key-terms,
individually and/or combined: ‘warm-up’, ‘warm-up
effects’; ‘priming exercise’; ‘pre-exercise’, ‘prior exercise’,‘warm-up and performance’ and ‘warm-up and swimming
performance’. Articles were also gathered based on refer-
ences from other relevant articles. Those articles withrestricted full text online were found in hardcopy form in
library archives.
Studies were included in the review if they fulﬁlled the
following selection criteria: (i) the studies were written in
English; (ii) they were published in a peer-reviewed jour-
nal; (iii) they contained research questions on the effects ofactive and/or passive warm-up in swimming; (iv) the main
outcome reported was a physiological (e.g. lactate, tem-
perature, heart rate, or rate of perceived effort), biome-chanical (e.g. stroke length, stroke frequency, or force) or
performance (e.g. time and velocity) measure; and
(v) healthy human participants were used. Review articles(qualitative review, systematic review, and meta-analysis)
were not considered.
In the initial search, 236 studies were identiﬁed. After
reading the titles, 59 articles were chosen for abstract
reading. Those that were clearly not relevant or did not
meet inclusion criteria were eliminated. A total of 18 ori-ginal research studies on the effects of warm-up on
swimming were included in our ﬁnal analysis (Table 1).
Fifteen studies focused on active warm-up, two studiesfocused on passive warm-up, and the remaining study
investigated both types of practices.
Studying warm-up involves a large number of variables
that interact with each other and possibly condition the
results. Because of the risk in separating those variables,
the ﬁndings and literature limitations were analyzed afterthe papers had been divided up according to active warm-
up and its sub-items (swim volume, intensity, recovery/rest
interval, and related/non-related warm-up) and passivewarm-up.320 H. P. Neiva et al.

3 Active Warm-Up and Swimming Performance
Active warm-up is any act of exercising, involving speciﬁc
and/or non-speciﬁc body movements, with the purpose ofincreasing metabolic activity and heat production in prep-
aration for an upcoming main activity [ 17,34]. Active
warm-up is traditionally the preferred method used bypractitioners and is the most commonly investigated type;
89 % of the studies about warm-up in swimming are about
active warm-up. Improvements were shown only in 67 %of the 12 studies that compared the use of active warm-up
with no warm-up. Five of these studies showed an
improvement in performance after warm-up, and threeothers suggested positive effects in the physiological and
biomechanical changes. The remaining studies did not ﬁnd
that warm-up had any effect on swimming performance(Table 1).
The ﬁrst studies suggested that warm-up allowed the
swimmers to go 1 % faster for short distances (up to 91 m)[23,35]. This positive inﬂuence was later conﬁrmed for
long distances, with a higher stroke length ( *0.07 m)
observed in the ﬁnal meters of 368.5 m [ 36] and lower
lactate concentrations ( *2 mmol/L) after 200 m of intense
swimming [ 30]. There were early ideas that priming
exercises are beneﬁcial to performance, but higher peaks inthe lactate concentration after 2 min of high-intensity
swimming (13.66 ±2.66 vs. 9.53 ±2.22 mmol/L;
pB0.05) have been reported [ 31]. Additionally, Bobo [ 32]
failed to ﬁnd signiﬁcant differences in 91.4 m performance
between three conditions (exercises in the water, dry landexercises, and no warm-up). The methods used could be
questioned as performance was assessed using a set of ﬁve
repetitions of 91.4 m freestyle at maximum intensity. Inaddition, beyond comparing the mean times of all repeti-
tions performed, the author analyzed the best repetition
performed, which is similar to a study that tested a singlerepetition. A recent study found that usual warm-up leads
to improved 100 m swimming performance, prolonging the
controversy [ 37].
There have been inconclusive results on a swimmer’s
performance for shorter distances after warm-up. One study
reported that warm-up did not have any favorable effects on50 m crawl performance [ 33], while participants in another
study had a trend toward signiﬁcantly faster times on the
45.7 m freestyle ( *0.2 s; p=0.06) and higher propelling
force with 30 s of maximal tethered swimming ( *13 % for
the mean force and 18 % for the maximal force; pB0.05),
as reported by Balilionis et al. [ 38] and Neiva et al. [ 18],
respectively, for warm-up. However, no differences were
found among the other variables measured in these studies
(e.g. perceived exertion, highest post-blood lactate con-centration, stroke rate, dive distance and reaction time),
which weakens these ﬁndings.The effects of active warm-up depend on several com-
ponents such as volume, intensity and recovery time [ 39,
40]. Some changes in the characteristics of the external
training/warm-up load could be essential to inﬂuencing thesubsequent performance and the results obtained. Further-
more, dry-land movements are usually performed before
swimmers enter the pool, and the effects of these move-ments should not be disregarded. The relevance of these
presented categories and their effects on swimming per-
formance require deeper analysis.
3.1 Dry-Land Warm-UpDry-land warm-up is any type of active practice performed
out of the water; dry-land warm-up includes calisthenics,strength/activation exercises and stretching. Swimmers
often perform some sort of physical activity out of the
water (e.g. arm rotation) before entering the water to
activate the body. However, these exercises are used to
complement and not as an alternative to the in-water warm-
up. Six studies have focused on the effects of dry-landwarm-up as a different type of active warm-up other than
the usual in-water procedures.
Three studies have shown that the use of calisthenics
exercises does not inﬂuence swimming performance com-
pared with the no warm-up condition [ 23,35,41].
Although there were no statistically signiﬁcant differences,the results of Romney and Nethery [ 41] showed that
swimmers were 0.65 s faster in the 91.4 m freestyle with
dry-land warm-up than without warm-up. This differencecorresponds to an increase of 1.23 % in performance,
which can substantially affect a swimming race.
With regard to strength exercises, Bobo [ 32] found no
differences in the 91.4 m freestyle between no warm-up
and bench press practice. The author claimed that the
amount of weight used may not have been heavy enough tostimulate the swimmers and may have interfered with the
results. In fact, Kilduff et al. [ 42] showed no differences in
the 15 m starting time after activation with loaded squats(3987 % of 1 maximal repetition) compared with in-
water warm-up. These weight exercises with a high load
can have positive effects by inducing high-frequencystimulation of motor neurons [ 13], resulting in an improved
rate of force production, which has already been conﬁrmed
for explosive efforts [ 15]. Strength exercises involving
large major muscle groups, with few repetitions and high
loads, could better prepare swimmers for competing.
An interesting method of dry-land exercise was used by
Nepocatych et al. [ 43] in master swimmers, adapting a
swim bench with an attached vibration device. This
allowed the swimmers to simulate the proper swimmingtechnique while being exposed to ﬁve sets of 1-min
vibrations. The authors found no differences in the 45.7 m324 H. P. Neiva et al.

freestyle time between the vibrations and in-water warm-
up. Although they are not easy to apply, developments
could arise from this research, and new alternative warm-
up procedures should be investigated and applied to higher-level swimmers.
In most swim meets, there is a considerable time interval
between the in-water warm-up and the swimming event,diminishing its possible beneﬁcial effects [ 19]. Moreover,
some facilities do not have an extra swimming pool
available, requiring swimmers to rely on alternatives to in-
water warm-up. Dry-land warm-up is a possible warm-up
procedure, which is supported by some studies. It is alsorecommended that the whole body should be stimulated
instead of focusing on speciﬁc muscle groups. To the
authors’ knowledge, no study on the addition of thesepractices to in-water warm-up has been conducted, even
though it could be a method of optimizing the swimmer
latency period between the warm-up and the swimmingevent.
Swimmers commonly use stretching exercises, but, to
the best of our knowledge, no study has been conducted onthe effects of stretching on swimming performance.
Additionally, little attention has been given to the question
of stretching as a practice that inﬂuences injury risk. Byreducing muscle strain and increasing the range of motion
of joints [ 1,44], stretching is expected to reduce the
resistance of movement, allowing for easier movement thatoptimizes the activity and prevents muscle and joint inju-
ries. Despite these possible beneﬁts, pre-exercise static
stretching does not produce a reduction in the risk ofoveruse injuries [ 45], and it could lead to a severe loss of
strength and performance impairment [ 46]. Yet, a decrease
in strength when using dynamic stretching exercises hasnot been demonstrated [ 47], suggesting that stretching may
be part of a warm-up routine if these are usual practices of
the swimmers. Further investigation is needed to determinethe effects of stretching alone as well as in combination
with other warm-up activities.
3.2 In-Water Warm-Up: the Effect of Volume
The acute effects of different warm-up volumes on swim-
ming performance have been previously researched in four
studies; two found positive effects for volumes between
1,000 and 1,500 m compared with a lower volume (i.e.lower than 200 m). A higher volume (1,371.6 m) allows
the swimmers to maintain higher stroke length (3.76 %) in
the last meters of 365.8 m at *95 % of maximal oxygen
consumption ( VO
2max), with similar values of blood lactate
concentration and heart rate [ 36]. This was later corrobo-
rated for shorter testing distances, verifying better 45.7 mperformance (1.22 %) after warming up for approximately
1,300 m (men: 1,257 ±160 m; women: 1,314 ±109 m)instead of a 91.44 m warm-up [ 38]. It is possible that the
lower volume was not sufﬁcient to cause signiﬁcant met-
abolic changes during the performance trial. In fact, the
same result was veriﬁed by Nepocatych et al. [ 43]i n
master swimmers, with no changes in the 45.7 m freestyle
after two short warm-ups (91.4 m and more than 450 m).
The remaining study on the inﬂuence of warm-up vol-
umes did not ﬁnd differences in the 91.4 m freestyle when
warming up for either 2,011.7 or 4,023.4 m with similar
intensities [ 48]. Swimmers may expend too much energy
during warm-up, or they may not have enough time after
warm-up to replenish their phosphocreatine and adenosinetriphosphate levels, compromising the energy supply and
negatively affecting their performance. For instance,
swimmers traditionally complete long warm-ups, even forshort races, to achieve greater water sensitivity and to be
better prepared for the competitive event. However, a long
duration of exercise has a higher energy consumption thatcan contribute to the early onset of muscle fatigue, espe-
cially for high intensities [ 49].
When subjected to a continuous activity at moderate
intensity, the body increases its temperature and stabilizes
between 10 and 20 min after the start [ 39]. Although this
time could be set as a rule of thumb, the volume of thewarm-up performed before swimming competitions differs
considerably. The ﬁrst study on active warm-up veriﬁed that
swimming for 110 m or 2.5 min [ 23] positively affected
swimming performance. The level of the swimmers
(untrained) may explain these positive results with such a
light warm-up volume. With lower physical preparedness, ashorter volume is required to activate the body to the main
task. A slightly longer warm-up, as required in the study by
De Vries [ 35], allowed veriﬁcation of the improvements in
swimming performance of competitive swimmers (457 m).
Nevertheless, the volumes presented were completed in
less than 10 min; this could be the reason why the fol-lowing studies focused on longer warm-ups. Using the
control condition of no warm-up, the 91.4 and 100 m
freestyle times and a propelling force in 30 s of tetheredswimming were improved after approximately 15 min of
swimming ( *1,000) [ 18,37,41]. Moreover, a warm-up of
1,000 m reduced the changes in the acid-base balance after200 m (2 min) of intense swimming [ 30].
There are some studies in which performance was
similar or even impaired after warm-up when comparedwith the no warm-up condition. There were no differences
in the 91 m freestyle after 731.5 m of moderate swimming
[32] or on the 50 m front crawl after 1,000 m of habitual
warm-up [ 33]. Some possible reasons for these results are
the time between warm-up and maximal swimming (not
allowing a sufﬁcient time to recover) and/or the volumeand intensity of the warm-up, which most likely were not
sufﬁcient to cause desirable metabolic effects.Warm-Up in Competitive Swimming 325
Author's personal copy
We propose a total warm-up volume of a 15–20 min
duration (between 1,000 and 1,500 m) for swimming
events up to 3–4 min. There is a trend toward increasing
the volume of warm-up in the morning. The reasoningbehind this is the need for extra body activation due to
adaptation to the circadian rhythm. However, Arnett [ 48]
found that the swimmers still perform better on the 91.4 min the afternoon even when a longer warm-up (4,023.4 vs.
2,011.7 m) was performed in the morning (58.48 ±5.69
and 56.86 ±4.87 s, respectively; pB0.05). This result
suggests that performance is signiﬁcantly higher in the late
afternoon, independent of the previous warm-up volumeperformed.
3.3 In-Water Warm-Up: the Effect of IntensityThe two studies on the use of different warm-up intensities
in swimming found no effects on performance. Houmardet al. [ 36] were the ﬁrst authors to compare the effects of
two different intensities of priming exercises on perfor-
mance ( *65 % VO
2max of continuous swimming vs. warm-
up including 4 945.7 m at *95 % VO2max), and no dif-
ferences were found in heart rate, stroke length or blood
lactate concentration after 365.8 m front crawl at *95 %
VO2max. Because volume was the same in the two experi-
mental conditions, the study did not use a speciﬁc, intensive
set to optimize performance. These conditions may result inextra energy expenditure and most likely inﬂuenced the
concentration of metabolites, thus impairing swimming
performance. In fact, warming up at 110 % VO
2max instead
of 70 % VO2max led to elevated lactate concentrations
(13.66 ±2.66 vs. 9.53 ±2.22 mmol/L; pB0.05) after
183 m freestyle at high-intensity [ 31]. The 5-min recovery
period after warm-up could have been insufﬁcient for
reducing the residual effects of the priming exercises. The
accumulation of lactate was higher after high-intensitywarm-up (6.97 ±1.97 vs. 2.27 ±0.81 mmol/L; pB0.05),
which could have contributed to the higher values obtained
after performance. Additionally, the lower volume per-formed during the high-intensity warm-up compared with
the low-intensity warm-up did not allow sufﬁcient activa-
tion of the aerobic metabolism. However, the heart rate(159.9 ±7.7 vs. 148.0 ±9.5 bpm; pB0.05) and VO
2max
(4.18 ±0.45 vs. 3.23 ±0.24 L/min; pB0.05) after the
warm-up showed cardiovascular alterations that might beindicative of enhanced aerobic metabolism for the high-
intensity priming exercises, regardless of the volume
performed.
Despite the uncertainties about including high-intensity
swimming sets in the warm-up procedures, it seems better
to use high-intensity swimming sets instead of not warmingup. Robergs et al. [ 30] found that lactate concentrations
after 200 m of intensive front crawl swimming were lowerwhen the warm-up included 4 950 m at 111 % VO
2max
(8.7 ±0.8 mmol/L vs. 10.9 ±0.5 mmol/L; pB0.05).
Furthermore, including a short-distance swimming set with
increased intensity over the repetitions was effective for91 m maximal freestyle [ 41]. The time performed was
reduced by 0.75 s compared with when there was no pre-
vious warm-up; thus, short distances at race pace couldoptimize performance. Thus, a short-distance set that is
built up from low intensity to race-pace velocity in the last
repetition could be used to improve subsequent perfor-
mance by stimulating the energy systems that are recruited
in the competitive event [ 39,40]. Nevertheless, when high-
intensity swimming is performed during warm-up, it
should be used with caution to avoid the early fatigue and
compromising the subsequent swimming performance.
3.4 Recovery Time After Warm-Up
Active warm-up seems to improve the performance with
periods of recovery up to 20 min, mainly related to tem-
perature mechanisms [ 19,40]. The time gaps between the
end of the in-water warm-up and the start of the competition/
test used in the research studies were 3 min [ 38,41], 5 min
[31,32], 8 min [ 42], and 10 min [ 18,30,33,37]. Never-
theless, according to our knowledge, the effect of different
time intervals between warm-up and the main task was only
studied by Zochowski et al. [ 50] and West et al. [ 19]. The
200 m times were 1.38 and 1.48 % better with 10-min [ 50]
and 20-min rest periods [ 19], respectively, instead of 45 min
of rest. The maintenance of an elevated core temperatureduring shorter intervals[ 19], and the higher heart rate at the
start of exercise which potentially increased baseline oxygen
consumption [ 50], are the possible mechanisms responsible
for the improved performance. In addition, the post-activa-
tion potentiation effect of warm-up, which happens around
the 8th min of recovery [ 42], possibly allowed swimmers to
start at an optimized power.
In real competition venues, it is almost impossible to
take less than 8–10 min between ﬁnishing the warm-up andthe swimming event. Warming up is more effective when it
is sufﬁciently intense to activate the physiological pro-
cesses that will be required in the competition event, with arecovery time that should be between 8 and 20 min,
allowing for replenishment of phosphocreatine [ 51]. The
literature only focuses on the effects of different intervalsin the 200 m swimming event, and the various competitive
distances and techniques could demand different recovery
periods. Moreover, considering the studies of Saez SaezVillarreal et al. [ 15], it would be interesting to know how
different muscle activations (e.g. using high-intensity
exercises or loaded concentric actions) can extend theeffects of warm-up as well as how swimmers can beneﬁt
from improved performance after a longer rest.326 H. P. Neiva et al.

4 Passive Warm-Up and Swimming Performance
Increases in muscle and core body temperature could be
achieved without physical activity by the use of externalheating, such as hot showers, saunas and heated vests [ 39].
These practices are commonly known as passive warm-up,
through which the swimmers most likely beneﬁt from theeffects of temperature-related mechanisms without spend-
ing energy. A variation in the muscle temperature of 1 /C176C
improves the muscle’s contractile properties and modiﬁesperformance by 2–5 % [ 52]. Therefore, passive warm-up
could be suggested as a practice for maintaining the tem-
perature between warm-up and the swimming event.However, heating cannot exceed 39 /C176C for the core tem-
perature, as overheating negatively affects motor drive and
muscular performance [ 52].
Three studies examined the effects of different passive
procedures on swimming performance with conﬂicting
results. Carlile [ 53] demonstrated that swimmers submit-
ting to 8 min of a hot shower or a 10-min massage attained
1 % higher swim velocity in 36.6 m than swimmers
without warm-up procedures. Conversely, De Vries [ 35]
veriﬁed that a 10-min massage did not inﬂuence the
91.44 m performance, which was instead positively inﬂu-
enced by active warm-up. Thus, while the ﬁrst study notedthe positive inﬂuence of passive warm-up in swimming
performance, there have been more studies questioning
these results. The applicability of these ﬁndings should be
weighed, as several decades have passed from the time
when research occurred. In fact, although there are fewstudies about active warm-up in swimming and the ﬁndings
are contradictory, the gap is even larger in regard to passive
warm-up. The large range of passive procedures, theunfamiliarity with some of those techniques and a possible
deviation of attention to active warm-up, which is the most
relevant form of pre-exercise, could be some of the reasonsfor this scarcity.
The understanding of the effects of different passive
procedures is also important for optimizing swimmingperformance. Two different practices of passive heating
were tested, and a carbonated bath at 36 /C176C was more
effective than a normal bath at the same temperature andduration of 4 min of kicking exercise [ 54]. The authors
proposed that this method be adopted by swimmers
because it tends to reduce the lactate concentration, heartrate and electromyography response of the rectus femoris,
suggesting higher muscle efﬁciency and less fatigue.
However, the low experience level of swimmers and thenon-existence of comparison with active warm-up, call into
question its efﬁciency.
Currently, there is no evidence-based information about
the effects of passive warm-up procedures in swimming
performance and the unclear indications cannot support thereliably of these methods, making them uncommon. How-
ever, it is not unusual to see swimmers completely dressed
up (sometimes with a jacket over a sweat suit), near starting
blocks, just before starting the race. The use of externalsources of heating most likely allows the swimmers to
extend the effects of the active warm-up that was performed
some time before. Beyond investigating the effects of pas-sive warm-up, we should try to understand how it could be
used when there is a long resting time after the active warm-
up or even as a complement to active warm-up.
5 Effect on Different Performance Events
The Olympic competition schedule for swimming includes
distances from 50 to 1,500 m in the pool and 10,000 m in
open-water swimming. As presented in Table 1, swimming
events performed in the pool are the main focus in warm-uprelated studies. Corresponding to efforts ranging from less
than 30 s to more than 15 min, it is expected that these
different events are stimulated by different warm-upapproaches as well. Considering the studies that used a
control condition (without warm-up), three of the six studies
that tested swimming distances up to 50 m or the equivalenteffort in time presented better performance after warm-up
[18,23,53]. Some uncertainty continues on distances up to
100 m, with three of four studies showing improved per-formance [ 35,37,41], as well as between the 100 and
200 m, with one of two studies mentioning lower lactate
values and higher heart rate [ 30]. Times on the distances
above 200 m were improved after warm-up when consid-
ering all of the studies presented [ 23,36]. Considering that
only submaximal tests were performed and mainly focused
on physiological variables, longer warm-ups should be
indicated when the competition distance is longer.

Researchers have focused mainly on the shorter dis-
tances, but the positive effects of warm-up seem more
consistent for distances above 200 m, reinforcing the pos-
sible positive effects of aerobic metabolism stimulationduring warm-up procedures. Moreover, the positive chan-
ges in performance on distances under 200 m were lower
than 1 % for the time improvement, and it is unclear howmuch of this effect was due to warm-up. Caution has to be
taken when studying any measure of performance, and, for
instance, it is important to show by how much that per-
formance measure would be expected to vary day-to-day or
test-to-test. Researchers should be aware of the deﬁcientknowledge about the effects of warm-up in the different
competition distances and swimming techniques, which
may be due to the existing lack of warm-up speciﬁcity.
6 Future Research
Some limitations were found in the literature that resear-
ched the topic covered in this review. In fact, it appears thatinvestigations of warm-up effects on swimming perfor-
mance were not performed for a few years, resulting in a
lack of research and resulting restrictions. The particularswimming pool environment, with a high temperature and
humidity, and the complexity of warm-up procedures could
explain why there are few studies on this topic.
Some methodological issues can be observed in the
literature and should be overcome in future research. For
instance, the control group or control condition in the studydesign sometimes did not exist, and a standard warm-up
was compared with other variations of it. This methodo-
logical issue may be relevant to the analysis of the resultsobtained and should be considered in the possible conclu-
sions. Additionally, the small sample sizes used in some of
the studies increased the effects of chance and enhancedthe ambiguity of the results.
Passive warm-up and dry-land exercises should be
deepened as alternative and/or complementary practice foran active warm-up. Additionally, most of the studies
focused on freestyle swimming, and a study on the warm-
up effects on different techniques and swimming distancesshould be developed. There is a gap in the research on the
inﬂuence of the different subject’s ages, gender, and
training status for selecting the proper warm-up. Oncesome of these broader issues are clariﬁed, we can evaluate
the structure and speciﬁcity of warm-up practices.
7 Conclusions
Warm-up is commonly accepted as fundamental, and any
priming practices are usually considered to optimizeperformance. Speciﬁcally in swimming, and despite some
contradictory results, research tends to suggest that warm-
up, more particularly the active type, has a positive effect
on the swimmer’s performance, especially for distancesabove 200 m. Additionally, the literature proposes that in-
water activities are the most useful activities, but when it is
not possible to do in-water warm-up, dry-land exercisescan be performed as an alternative.
Dry-land warm-up should include all body segments.
Strength exercises with few repetitions and high-load
intensities, vibration stimulation, or the use of calisthenics
are hypothesized to better prepare the swimmer for racing.Although there are some doubts about using these methods,
some studies found promising results, with no differences
in performance compared with in-water warm-up. Weightand vibration exercises are not practical to perform before a
swimming event, but calisthenics can be used. Further
investigation is needed to reach a consensus about the useof alternative methods of warming up and deﬁne its ideal
structure in terms of the type, duration, volume, speciﬁc
and/or general tasks, and recovery period. Moreover, littleis known about dry-land exercise for maintaining the
effects of the in-water warm-up during the waiting time
before the swimming race. Additionally, the use ofstretching exercises is common among swimmers as a
complement to the in-water warm-up, but the effects are
not known and could even impair performance. Dynamicstretches are not detrimental to performance, and a daily
routine could be replicated in warm-up procedures to pre-
vent possible injuries.
The in-water warm-up should last for 15–25 min, and
short, intensive, and speciﬁc tasks can be performed in
some parts of the warm-up; there are favorable effects aftershort distances of progressive swimming up to the race-
pace velocity. However, one should be cautious because
high-intensity swimming during warm-up can be over-valued and may not be essential to performance optimi-
zation. Moreover, some studies presented standard warm-
ups with exclusive lower/upper limb exercises that mayachieve better activation for each body part. A swimming
race is performed using the whole body and splitting
stimulation of the body may not be the best way to increasethe swimmer’s preparedness. The use of technical drills
during warm-up could increase the swimming efﬁciency in
the ﬁrst meters by the longer distance per stroke achieved[37]. The recovery period after warming up should be
balanced so that it is sufﬁcient for energy replenishment
and so that swimmers can beneﬁt from the proposed effectsof warm-up (Table 2).
Because there is a latency period between the in-water
warm-up and the swimming race, passive warm-up shouldbe considered. Despite the lack of concrete evidence, these
practices could be used to maintain elevated core and328 H. P. Neiva et al.

muscle temperatures, which are beneﬁcial for swimmers.
Little is known about the best passive practices to imple-
ment, but passive exercise could be any method that does
not elevate the temperature above 39 /C176C, which would
otherwise impair performance.
Scientists have recently started to study the effects of
warm-up on swimming performance, but numerous doubtsremain. Not much is known about the structure and com-
ponents of warm-up even though it is still thought to
inﬂuence performance in a sport where a tenth of a second
could determine success or failure. The results highlight
that the volume, intensity and recovery, and speciﬁcexercises of active warm-up are complementary variables.
Any change carried out in one of these characteristics leads
to variations in the others, which can inﬂuence the results.
