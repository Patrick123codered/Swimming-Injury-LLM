Abstract. Swimming is important for promoting and 
maintaining health, as it can increase the efficiency of 
the cardiovascular system and decrease the occurrence of 
cardiovascular diseases. The objective of the present study 
was to examine whether swimming training could decrease 
myocardial injury in rats caused by myocardial isch ‑
emia/reperfusion (I/R). Sprague‑Dawley rats were randomized 
into four groups, namely the Sham, coronary artery occlusion, 
swimming training and ischemic preconditioning  (IPC) 
groups. Myocardial I/R was induced in anesthetized male 
Sprague‑Dawley rats by a 40‑min occlusion followed by 
a 3‑h reperfusion of the left anterior descending coronary 
artery. The rats were sacrificed after surgery and their hearts 
were examined. The results demonstrated that the number of 
TUNEL‑positive nuclei and degree of caspase‑3 activation 
were both significantly increased in the myocardium following 
myocardial I/R in rats, indicating increased cardiomyocyte 
apoptosis. On the other hand, swimming training decreased 
the serum levels of creatine phosphokinase, lactate dehydroge ‑
nase and cardiac troponin I, and was associated with reduced 
histological damage and myocardial infarct size. Furthermore, 
swimming training also reduced TNF‑ α levels, caspase‑3 
activation and enhanced Bcl‑2 activation, which decreased 
the number of apoptotic cells in the myocardium. The find ‑
ings of the present study showed that swimming training and 
IPC could similarly decrease myocardial injury following 
myocardial I/R, and may therefore be used as exercise training 
to effectively prevent myocardial injury.
Introduction
The World Health Organization (2019) reported that heart 
disease, stroke and other cardiovascular diseases are the most frequent causes of death, with ischemic heart 
disease (IHD) accounting for the largest number of cardio ‑
vascular diseases‑related deaths (1,2). The Global Burden of 
Disease (GBD) study from 2016 stated that IHD and stroke 
are both types of cardiovascular diseases, and cardiovascular 
diseases overall are categorized as the leading cause of death 
in humans (2).
IHD refers to heart disease caused by insufficient blood 
circulation due to coronary artery stenosis, which manifests as 
decreased blood perfusion of the heart, resulting in myocardial 
ischemia, decreased metabolism and abnormal cardiac func ‑
tion (3,4). When the vascular diameter decreases or occlusion 
occurs due to coronary artery endothelial cell thickening, lipid 
deposition or thrombosis, an imbalance develops between 
myocardial oxygen supply and demand, which further 
causes cardiomyocyte apoptosis or necrosis (5). Therefore, 
cardiac blood flow should be restored as soon as possible 
after myocardial ischemia to prevent myocardial necrosis; 
however, myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) also damages 
cardiomyocytes, which is termed myocardial I/R injury 
(MIRI) (6). MIRI is known to be associated with the inci ‑
dence and mortality rate of cardiovascular diseases (7), as the 
myocardium develops biochemical and metabolic alterations 
during I/R. These include rapid intracellular ATP exhaus ‑
tion, calcium overload leading to cell membrane disruption, 
synthesis of a large number of reactive oxygen species (ROS) 
and a decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, leading to 
caspase‑3 activation and myocardial hypercontracture  (8‑11), 
thereby leading to cardiomyocyte death.
Ischemic preconditioning (IPC), one of the most common 
methods used to decrease the severity of myocardial injury in 
myocardial infarction (MI) studies, refers to administration of 
transient non‑lethal infarction stimulation prior to the occur ‑
rence of fatal myocardial ischemia events. This stimulation 
induces immune system mechanisms and releases endogenous 
protective substances, such as adenosine, bradykinin and nitric 
oxide, to protect the myocardium and preserve energy metabo ‑
lism, thereby decreasing the damage caused as well as the 
risk of fatal infarction (12,13). IPC in vivo  has predominantly 
been performed in animal studies, and the earliest study by 
Murry  et al (14) found that IPC could protect the myocardium 
against persistent ischemic injury and reduce the infarct 
size (14‑17). Subsequently, several studies have employed IPC 
in a number of animal experiments, such as rabbit, rat, murine 
and swine animal models, and proved that IPC protected the Effects of swimming training on myocardial protection in rats

heart after MIRI, and also protected against abnormal systolic 
function and arrhythmia after ischemia (18‑21).
Exercise is key for promoting and maintaining human 
health. Regular aerobic exercise can promote metabolism, 
improve hormone equilibrium, improve cognitive function, 
and it is also an important factor that controls cardiovascular 
disease (22,23). It is well known that exercise can improve 
systemic circulation to increase cardiopulmonary function, 
increase coronary artery perfusion and improve cardiac 
tolerance (24‑26).
It was previously demonstrated that exercise can be 
beneficial to myocardial function, as it can increase the 
ventricular dimensions, myocardial mass, cardiac output and 
stroke volume (27,28). The effect of exercise training on MI 
was first evidenced in the study by McElroy et al (29). They 
found that the formation of new blood vessels in the hearts 
of rats after exercise reduced the infarct size after MI. In 
animals, running on a treadmill and swimming are primarily 
employed as interventional methods. For example, rats that 
undergo treadmill training are shown to have improved 
recovery in blood pumping capacity following myocardial 
ischemia, and they also exhibit increased levels of cardiac anti ‑
oxidant enzymes, which decrease lipid peroxidation (30,31). 
Swimming can increase cardiac antioxidant capacity in rats 
and improve the systolic function of the aged myocardium. In 
addition, swimming training prior to MI can increase cardiac 
arteriole density and aid in improving cardiac function at the 
remodeling phase  (32‑34).
Reducing cell death and myocardial injury caused by 
IHD and MIRI has been an important focus of research. 
Mitochondrial dysfunction following MIRI can induce 
apoptotic cell death, since the mitochondrial apoptogenic 
factor, cytochrome c, is released into the cytoplasm to activate 
caspase‑3‑mediated apoptosis (35); however, cytochrome c 
leakage to the cytosol can be inhibited by Bcl‑2/Bcl‑xL  (36). 
Furthermore, myocardial I/R causes the release of TNF‑ α, 
which is a proinflammatory cytokine that exacerbates MIRI 
at an early stage of reperfusion by activating NF‑ κB, facili ‑
tating leukocyte infiltration and inducing apoptosis (37,38). 
Animal experiments were performed in the present study to 
examine whether exercise intervention could protect against 
cardiovascular disease and to explore the roles of apoptotic 
signaling elements, such as TNF‑ α, activated caspase‑3 and 
Bcl‑2. The findings of the present study may lead to optimiza ‑
tion of exercise programming for healthy individuals, athletes 
and patients with heart failure seeking strategies to enhance 
cardiac function (39).
Materials and methods
Ethics approval. The present study was approved by the 
Animal Experiment Committee of University of Taipei 
(Taipei, Taiwan; IACUC approval no. UT110001). The animals 
used in the study were managed in a humane manner in 
accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory 
Animals  (40).
Animal preparation. A total of 42 Sprague‑Dawley male 
rats, which were purchased from BioLASCO, and weighed 
250‑280 g, were used in the present study. A total of 1 week prior to the experiment, the rats were moved to the laboratory 
to allow them to acclimate. The rats were given ad libitum  
access to food and water, and maintained with a 12 h light/dark 
cycle from 6:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m., and the room temperature 
was controlled at 25˚C and a humidity of 55±5%.
The rats were randomly assigned to one of four groups 
as follows: Sham control group (Sham, n=10), myocardial 
ischemia group (coronary artery occlusion; CAO, n=10), 
swimming training group (EXC, n=10) and IPC group (IPC, 
n=10). Rats in the EXC group were allowed to acclimate to 
swimming training at the age of 3 weeks. Swimming started 
at 15 min per day and was increased to 180 min per day at day 6. 
At 4‑7 weeks of age, the rats underwent 3 h of swimming 
training per day. Water temperature was controlled at 35‑37˚C. 
The forced swimming test procedure was employed for swim ‑
ming training (41). Since the forced swimming test procedure 
was employed in the swimming training, the rats were kept 
in the status of swimming throughout the training period in 
which they could not reach the bottom or hang on the side 
with the continued supervision of the experimenters. In other 
words, the time of immobility and climbing while the rats in 
the water was completely excluded.
Experimental protocol. The rats were anesthetized by intra ‑
peritoneal injection of 20 mg/kg BW Zoletil 50 [tiletamine 
+ zolezepam; Virbac (Taiwan) Co., Ltd.] and intraperitoneal 
injection of 10 mg/kg BW Balanzine (xylazine 2% w/v) (42). 
After tracheotomy, each rat was intubated and ventilated, and 
the carotid artery was cannulated for the direct BP measure ‑
ment. Throughout the experiment, heart rate, systolic blood 
pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and mean 
arterial pressure (MAP) were recorded using a direct measure ‑
ment method through the carotid artery with a Biopac MP150 
(Biopac Data Acquisition System). The purpose of detecting 
hemodynamic changes was to observe the heart condition of 
each group of experimental rats before, during and after the 
experiment. Electrocardiography leads were placed on limbs. 
After median sternotomy, a 4‑0 silk suture was passed around 
the proximal part of the left anterior descending coronary 
artery. The ends of the silk suture were threaded through a 
small vinyl tube to form a snare. The body temperature was 
monitored using a rectal thermometer and maintained at 37˚C 
with heating pads throughout the experiments.
After achieving hemodynamic stability for 20 min, the rats 
were divided randomly into four groups. Group 1 rats (Sham) 
underwent the same surgical procedures without any pretreat ‑
ment, CAO or reperfusion. Group 2 rats (CAO) did not receive 
any pretreatment. Group 3 rats (EXC) underwent 4 weeks of 
swimming training intervention prior to surgery. In group 4 
rats (IPC), IPC was induced via two 10‑min episodes of CAO. 
The two episodes of CAO were followed by 10 min of reperfu ‑
sion. At 10 min after the previously mentioned treatments, a 
40‑min CAO was induced in the rats in groups 2, 3 and 4 by 
pulling the snare around the left anterior descending coronary 
artery. Successful occlusion was verified by observing the 
development of ST segment elevation and changes in the QRS 
complex on the electrocardiogram and cyanotic changes in the 
myocardium in the occluded area. After 40 min of CAO, the 
snare was released for reperfusion for 3 h. Reperfusion was 
confirmed by refilling of the coronary artery and visualizing a

reactive hyperemic response. Arterial pressure, heart rate and 
electrocardiography were recorded simultaneously and contin ‑
uously throughout the experiment. The grouping flowchart 
is shown in Fig. 1. After the operation, rats were euthanized 
by exsanguination. Blood specimens were collected from 
the carotid artery and serum separated after centrifugation 
(2,000 x g at 4˚C for 20 min) for biochemical research.
Determination of the area at risk (AAR) and MI size. The dyeing 
methods of Zhao et al (43) were followed. After the experiment 
was completed, heparin (1,000 U) was injected intravenously. 
Subsequently, the heart was resected and the previous MI site 
was re‑ligated. Next, 1%  Evans blue dye (MilliporeSigma) 
was perfused into the ascending aorta. After perfusion was 
completed, five transverse sections were made through the 
left ventricle and interventricular septum. The sections were 
immersed in 1% triphenyl tetrazolium chloride solution and 
heated in a 37˚C thermostatic water bath for 20 min. After 
heating, the sections were weighed, and 10% formalin solution 
was added to fix the sections at room temperature for 24 h. 
The colors of blue, pale and red respectively represented the 
normal, infarcted and ischemic tissue. The total weight of the 
AAR and MI were calculated and the sum was taken. AAR is 
defined as the myocardial tissue within the vascular territory 
that is distal to the culprit lesion of the infarct‑related artery. 
AAR is the percentage of the weight of the red area divided 
by the weight of the left ventricle; MI is the percentage of the 
weight of the white area divided by the red area (44).
Biochemical analysis of cardiac function. Blood was 
collected from rats in each group after the experiment was 
completed. The levels of troponin I, lactate dehydrogenase 
(LDH) and creatine phosphokinase (CPK) were subsequently 
measured. CPK and LDH activities were determined 
according to standard methods using diagnostic kits from 
BioSystems S.A. Assessment of serum troponin I was carried 
out via enzyme‑linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using 
a commercial kit purchased from DRG International, Inc. 
The concentration of Troponin‑I, LDH and CPK in the blood 
is increased following myocardial damage, such as acute 
myocardial infarction, shock, hypoxia or acute coronary 
artery disease. Therefore, the aforementioned factors can be 
used as the clinical diagnosis of myocardial infarction and 
evaluation  (45).
Histological examination of the heart. At the end of the 
experiment, the hearts from four rats in each group were 
harvested. Part of the heart was fixed using 10% paraformal ‑
dehyde at room temperature for 24 h, dehydrated, embedded in 
paraffin, cut into 4‑µm sections and mounted on glass slides. 
The sections were then deparaffinized using xylene at room 
temperature for 10 min, and counterstained using hematoxylin 
and eosin (H&E) at room temperature for 7 min. Finally, the 
samples were analyzed using an inverted light microscope 
(CKX53; Olympus Corporation) at x400 magnification. The 
severity of myocardial injury was determined using a morpho ‑
logical scoring system as follows: 0, no damage; 1, interstitial 
edema and focal necrosis; 2, diffuse myocardial cell swelling 
and necrosis; 3, necrosis with contraction bands and neutrophil 
infiltrate; and 4, widespread necrosis with contraction bands, neutrophil infiltrate and hemorrhage. The evaluation of the 
myocardial damages based on the HE staining was the average 
of the scores from two separate examiners (46). To make 
comparisons between groups, the mean score and standard 
deviation of each group was calculated.
TUNEL staining analysis of the heart. Briefly, when the 
experiments were completed, the hearts were cut into 
4‑µm sections and fixed in acetone at room temperature 
for 24 h. Then, the samples were moved into a solution 
containing terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase and detec ‑
tion buffer (Roche Diagnostics GmbH), conjugated with 
horseradish peroxidase, and incubated at 37˚C for 60 min. 
A diamino‑benzidine‑chromogen (Boehringer) was used. 
Several further steps were introduced to obtain the end value 
of the number of TUNEL‑positive nuclei, including the 
samples were analyzed using an inverted light microscope 
(CKX53; Olympus Corporation) at x400 magnification, then 
selecting an area randomly, counting the nuclei in that area, 
and converting the value to a percentage by dividing it by the 
total number of the cell nuclei.
Western blot analysis. Briefly, when the experiments were 
completed, the hearts of four rats from each group were 
moved into the tissue protein extraction reagent (T‑PER; 
Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) at 4˚C for homogenization; 
the myocardial cell lysate was prepared in cold lysis buffer 
[25 mM Tris‑HCl (pH 7.6), 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP‑40, 
1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS]. Samples were centri ‑
fuged at 10,000 x g at 4˚C for 10 min, and a modified Bradford 
assay which compared with the conventional Bradford method 
was used to determine protein concentrations. Notably, the 
characteristics are stable, the measurement speed is fast, the 
sensitivity is high and the error rate is small. A total of 60 µg of 
protein were loaded and separated using 15%  SDS‑PAGE and 
then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. After blocking 
with 5% non‑fat dry milk in Tris‑buffered saline containing 
0.1% Tween‑20 (TBST) at 37˚C for 30 min, the membranes

exception of the SHAM group, all rats underwent a 40‑min CAO and 3‑h 
reperfusion after the different treatments. During the treatment period, 
the SHAM group did not receive any pretreatments. The EXC group first 
underwent 4 weeks of swimming training before the experiment. The 
IPC group received ischemic preconditioning by undergoing two 10‑min 
episodes of CAO and 10‑min reperfusion. CAO, coronary artery occlusion;

were incubated with anti‑caspase‑3 (cat. no. IMG‑144A; 
Imgenex), anti‑TNF‑ α (cat. no. sc‑52746; Santa Cruz 
Biotechnology) or anti‑Bcl‑2 antibodies (cat.  no. 633502; 
BioLegend; all 1:1,000) in 5% non‑fat dry milk at 4˚C for 24 h. 
The membranes were then incubated in 5% non‑fat dry milk 
in TBST containing secondary antibody (m‑IgG κ BP‑HRP; 
cat. no. sc‑516102; Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1:1,000) conju ‑
gated to horseradish peroxidase. To visualize the peroxidase 
activity, an enhanced chemiluminescence substrate system 
was used, followed by exposing the membranes to hyper ‑
films. β‑actin (cat. no. 643802; BioLegend; 1:1,000) was used 
at room temperature for 2 h as a loading control. ImageJ 
version 1.6 (National Institutes of Health) was used for densi ‑
tometry analysis, and each gel was normalized against the 
background density.
Capillary density measurements in tissue sections. To visu ‑
alize the capillaries in the myocardium, endothelial cells were 
stained with CD31, often used as a biological marker to repre ‑
sent the capillary vessels in the myocardium. Angiogenesis 
was quantitatively assessed based on CD31‑positive capillary 
vessels for the determination of capillary density. For immu ‑
nostaining, a rabbit anti‑rat CD31 antibody (cat. no. sc‑376764; 
Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1:100) was used at room tempera ‑
ture for 15 min. Staining was visualized by reaction with 
DAB (MilliporeSigma; 1:20). Capillaries were visualized in 
the myocardium as a brown precipitate, identified as having a 
diameter <20 µm and a layer of endothelial cells without smooth 
muscle cells. Computer‑assisted morphometry was performed 
using Image Pro Plus version 5.0 (Media Cybernetics, Inc).
Statistical analysis. Data are presented as the mean ± stan‑
dard deviation, and statistical analysis was performed using 
SPSS 20.0 (IBM Corp.). Hemodynamic variables were 
analyzed using a two‑way repeated measures ANOVA. 
Otherwise, data were analyzed using a one‑way ANOVA and 
a Bonferroni post hoc multiple comparisons test. The ordinal 
values of the myocardial injury scores were analyzed using 
a Mann‑Whitney U test. P<0.05 was considered to indicate a 
statistically significant difference.
Results
Comparison of mortality rates amongst the four groups. A 
total of 42 rats were used in the present study. Of those 42 rats, 
1 rat in the CAO group died from heart failure, which was 
defined as a progressive decrease of the systolic arterial pres ‑
sure to <50 mmHg with global left ventricular dilatation and 
poor contraction; and 1 rat in the IPC group developed ventric ‑
ular fibrillation and died. These two  rats were excluded from 
the study. No statistically significant difference was observed 
amongst the four groups in terms of mortality rate (P=0.591).
Comparison of changes in hemodynamic variables during the 
experiments amongst the four groups. No significant differ ‑
ence was found amongst the four groups in terms of mean 
arterial pressure and heart rate, at baseline and throughout 
the experiments. In addition, the changes in hemodynamic 
variables did not reach a level of statistical significance during 
the experiments in the four groups (Table I).Comparison of AAR and MI size amongst the CAO, EXC and 
IPC groups. When the experiments were completed, six rats 
from each group were randomly selected to collect cardiac 
tissues for AAR and MI size analysis. The AAR of the left 
ventricular infarct area is shown in Fig. 2A. The MI size, 
expressed as a percentage of AAR, is shown in Fig. 2B. The 
results demonstrated that there was no statistically significant 
difference in AAR amongst the three groups (50.44±1.75% in 
CAO vs. 49.90±1.62%  in EXC and 49.29±0.88%  in IPC; 
P>0.05), while the MI size was significantly decreased in the 
EXC and IPC experimental groups compared with the CAO 
group (20.27±0.88% in EXC and 19.37±0.95% in IPC vs. 
28.15±1.54% in CAO;  P<0.001).
Intervention with EXC and IPC significantly reduces the 
serum concentrations of troponin I, LDH and CPK after 
myocardial I/R. When the experiments were completed, 
six rats from each group were randomly selected to collect 
blood samples for biochemical analysis of cardiac func ‑
tion. CAO group rats, compared with Sham group rats, 
exhibited significantly increased serum levels of troponin I 
(298.08±173.09 ng/ml vs. 0.68±0.47 ng/ml, respec ‑
tively; P<0.05; Fig. 3A), LDH (4,606.17±1,057.12 U/l vs. 
259.83±127.48 U/l, respectively; P<0.001, Fig. 3B) and CPK 
(8,531.33±591.00 U/l vs. 577.50±19.40 U/l, respectively; 
P<0.001, Fig. 3C). The EXC and IPC groups exhibited 
significantly less prominent increases in the serum levels of 
troponin I (41.56±10.44 and 41.31±9.23 ng/ml, respectively, 
vs. the CAO group; P<0.05; Fig. 3A), LDH (1,496.33±292.03 
and 1,351.83±265.11 IU/l, respectively, vs. the CAO group; 
P<0.001; Fig. 3B) and CPK (3,918.17±1,761.22 and 3,867.00±
755.85 U/l, respectively, vs. the CAO group; P<0.01; Fig. 3C). 
No significant differences between the EXC and IPC groups 
were observed (P>0.05).
EXC and IPC interventions significantly reduces MIRI. At 
the end of the experiments, four rats from each group were 
randomly selected, and part of their hearts was sent for histo ‑
logical examination in order to identify cardiac injury. The 
myocardium in the left ventricle of the rats in the Sham group 
appeared normal  (Fig.  4A); however, the myocardium of rats 
in the CAO group exhibited interstitial edema, myocardial cell 
swelling and disruption of myocardial fibers. The myocardial 
injury scores of the rats in the CAO group were significantly 
higher compared with those of the rats in the Sham group 
(P<0.001; Fig. 4B). However, EXC and IPC significantly 
reduced the extent of histological damage, and the myocardial 
injury scores of the rats in the EXC and IPC groups were 
significantly decreased compared with those in the CAO group 
(P<0.001).
EXC and IPC interventions significantly reduces the number 
of apoptotic cardiomyocytes after myocardial I/R. TUNEL 
staining is a sensitive method commonly used for detecting 
apoptosis (47). At the end of the experiment, four rats from 
each group were randomly selected, and their hearts were 
subjected to TUNEL staining, which was used to locate DNA 
fragmentation in the nuclei of apoptotic cardiomyocytes 
appearing as a dark brown reaction product. Of note, only 
a small portion of the hearts of the rats in the Sham group

exhibited TUNEL‑stained nuclei (Fig. 5A). With regard to 
the rats in the CAO group, heart samples were also found to 
exhibit TUNEL staining, which was induced by myocardial 
I/R. In the EXC and IPC groups, dark brown staining was 
observed in the heart samples in the form of scattered nuclei.

(34.4±5.5% vs. 2.3±0.7%, respectively; P<0.001; Fig. 5B), and 
the corresponding percentages in the EXC and IPC groups 
were decreased significantly (19.7±1.2 and 19.0±1.5%, respec ‑
tively, vs. the CAO group; P<0.05; Fig. 5B). No significant 
difference in the numbers of TUNEL‑positive nuclei between 
the EXC and IPC groups was observed (Fig. 5B).
EXC and IPC interventions significantly reduces the levels 
of TNF‑ α and activated caspase‑3, and increases the levels 
of Bcl‑2 in cardiomyocytes. TNFs are, a family of cellular 
signaling proteins that are involved in systemic inflamma ‑
tion, and are some of the most critical pro‑inflammatory 
cytokines (48). Activated caspase‑3 is a universal effector of 
apoptosis (49), and Bcl‑2 is an important gene family that controls the primary apoptotic pathway (49). To measure 
the levels of TNF‑ α, activated caspase‑3 and Bcl‑2, four rats 
from each group were randomly selected and western blot 
analysis on their heart samples was conducted at the end of the 
experiments. Compared with the Sham group, myocardial I/R 
significantly increased the TNF‑ α levels in the hearts of the 
rats in the CAO group (P<0.001; lane 2, Fig. 6A). The EXC and 
IPC groups exhibited a significantly less prominent increase

in TNF‑ α levels in the hearts subjected to myocardial I/R 
(P<0.001 vs. CAO group; lanes 3 and 4, Fig. 6A). There was no 
significant difference in TNF‑ α expression between the EXC 
and IPC groups (Fig. 6A). Caspase‑3 is cleaved to an active 
p17 subunit (17 kDa) when apoptosis is induced. According to 
the results of western blot analysis, which showed a significant 
increase in the activated caspase‑3 band, it was inferred that 
myocardial I/R could increase the levels of activated caspase‑3 
in the hearts (P<0.001 vs. Sham group; lane 2, Fig. 6B); 
conversely, the increase in activated caspase‑3 was significantly 
inhibited in the EXC and IPC groups (P<0.001 vs. CAO group; 
lanes 3 and  4, Fig.  6B). No significant difference in the acti ‑
vated caspase‑3 expression between the EXC and IPC groups was observed (Fig. 6B). Compared with the Sham group, CAO 
group hearts exhibited a significant reduction in Bcl‑2 levels 
(P<0.001 vs. Sham group; lane 2, Fig. 6C), while this decrease 
in Bcl‑2 levels was significantly inhibited in the EXC and IPC 
groups (P <0.001 vs. CAO group; lanes 3 and 4, Fig. 6C). No 
significant difference in the Bcl‑2 expression levels between 
the EXC and IPC groups was observed (Fig. 6C).
EXC significantly increases the density of myocardial blood 
vessels. At the end of the experiments, four rats from each 
group were randomly selected, and part of their hearts were 
used for CD31 staining analysis in order to identify the density 
of myocardial blood vessels. Compared with the Sham,

CAO and IPC groups, the EXC group exhibited a significant 
increase in the density of myocardial blood vessels (P<0.001 
vs. SHAM, CAO and IPC groups; Fig. 7).Discussion
In the present study, it was demonstrated that swimming 
training could significantly decrease myocardial injury, MI 
size, serum concentrations of MI markers (troponin I, CPK 
and LDH) and cardiomyocyte apoptosis following a myocar ‑
dial I/R, and the myocardial protective effects were even 
comparable to those of the commonly used method of IPC.
The intense and sustained changes of myocardial injury 
that occur during the myocardial ischemic period lay the 
foundation for the reperfusion injury that follows. This type 
of I/R injury has been proven to be an extension of ischemic 
injury, which further exacerbates irreversible myocardial 
injury (44,46). Therefore, strategies for preventing reperfu ‑
sion injury are the important aspect of treatment of related 
heart diseases. Previous studies have proven that IPC can 
significantly decrease MI size, DNA laddering, the number of 
TUNEL‑stained nuclei and cardiomyocyte apoptosis to exert 
cardioprotective effects (50,51).
It has been demonstrated that the cardioprotective effects 
of IPC can be exerted in two temporal windows. The first is 
active within minutes to hours after the conditioning stress; 
the second, known as ‘second window of protection’, becomes 
active 1‑3 days later (52,53). The mechanisms underlying 
training‑induced cardioprotection resemble those elicited by 
IPC, whereby short ischemic episodes prior to a major isch ‑
emic insult trigger endogenous cardioprotective mechanisms. 
Training may induce IPC by emulating minor local ischemic 
episodes, with ischemia occurring as short periods of time 
during which the supply of blood and oxygen to tissues is 
limited with respect to the tissue requirements (54).
The experimental results of the present study revealed that 
MI size was significantly decreased after myocardial I/R in 
rats that underwent swimming training. There was no signifi ‑
cant difference in AAR among the three groups (groups 2‑4) 
and no significant hemodynamic changes were observed 
during the surgical procedure. Therefore, reduced MI size 
could not be attributed to differences in surgical technique or 
hemodynamic changes.
Intermittent hypoxia is broadly defined as repeated episodes 
of hypoxia interspersed with episodes of normoxia. The defini ‑
tion of intermittent hypoxia varies widely in terms of cycle 
length, number of hypoxic episodes per day and the number 
of days of exposure. Nevertheless, it has been confirmed that 
repeated incidents of ischemia and hypoxia may lead to physi ‑
ological changes and are considered as one of the key factors 
involved in cardiovascular diseases, general inflammation and 
heart disease (55,56).
Intermittent hypoxia primarily affects the cardiac 
structure and function via oxidative damage caused by free 
radicals (57). Myocardial I/R disrupts the mitochondrial 
respiratory chain and is accompanied by ATP depletion, 
resulting in the accumulation of mitochondrial ROS (51). 
The effects of IPC are mediated through activating KATP 
channels in the mitochondria. Once activated, the progress 
of phosphorylation in mitochondria is accelerated, which 
results in a reduction in ATP consumption in mitochondria, 
i.e., a reduction in the metabolic rate in cells (58). ROS levels 
increase during exercise; however, mounting epidemiological 
data have proven that exercise decreases the incidence of

oxidative stress‑associated diseases owing to exercise‑induced 
adaptation (59,60). Exercise training can protect cardiac 
subsarcolemmal and intermyofibrillar mitochondria, enabling 
them to adapt to transient hypoxia and decreasing ROS 
production, increasing their ability to tolerate high calcium 
levels, and preventing oxidative damage caused by myocardial 
I/R to achieve cardioprotection (61,62). In addition, mitochon ‑
dria contain an antioxidant enzyme known as Mn superoxide 
dismutase (MnSOD) that can decrease intracellular oxidative 
stress (63). The cytoplasm also possesses a Cu/ZnSOD that has 
a function similar to MnSOD (64). Research indicates that IPC 
can exert protective effects through the induction of MnSOD. 
In addition, the levels of MnSOD and Cu/ZnSOD were found 
to be increased in rat cardiomyocytes after exercise training, 
which inhibited apoptosis (65,66). Therefore, it may be 
hypothesized that myocardial antioxidant effects induced by 
exercise can decrease myocardial injury and cellular damage, 
thereby reducing MI size.
When cardiomyocytes are exposed to ischemia or hypoxia, 
the mitochondrial matrix shrinks, leading to an enlargement 
of the intermembrane space and resulting in a disorientation of 
cardiomyocytes and disruption of the myocardial structure, and 
a release of endocardial substances (67). In addition, ischemia 
in the myocardium can cause the membrane potential of mito ‑
chondria to dissipate, leading to an increase in the permeability 
and an opening in mitochondrial permeability transition pore 
(mPTP), resulting in a release of apoptosis‑inducing factors 
from mitochondria  (67). Therefore, the evaluation of cardio ‑
myocyte injury could be performed by determining the plasma 
levels of specific and sensitive biomarkers, such as troponin I, 
CPK and LDH (68‑70). It has been found that IPC, by acti ‑
vating protein kinase C, can open KATP channels, reduce the 
release of myocardial enzymes by reducing the consumption 
of ATP, and create an inflow of potassium ions and other ions, 
which may help the myocardium reach a balance in osmotic 
pressure and potential equilibrium, so as to mitigate myocar ‑
dial injury (71). Theoretically, the cardioprotective effects of 
exercise may be attributed to the fact that exercise training induces a mitochondrial phenotype, including increases in 
the protein levels of primary antioxidant enzymes in both 
subsarcolemmal and interfibrillar mitochondria, attenuation 
of ROS‑induced cytochrome c release, and reduced maximal 
rates of mPTP opening (72,73). Furthermore, the ratio of blood 
vessels/muscle fibers increases in healthy hearts after exercise 
intervention. In addition, exercise training in advance can also 
increase angiogenesis after MI (74,75). Similar results were 
obtained in the present study, which showed that swimming 
intervention increased angiogenesis in the heart. The results 
of the present study showed that cardiomyocytes released 
troponin I, LDH and CPK into the blood after I/R. Therefore, 
these three enzymes were found to be significantly elevated 
in the CAO group. On the other hand, there were significantly 
lower levels of the aforementioned three enzymes in the EXC 
and IPC groups compared with those in the CAO group. 
Therefore, it can be deduced that exercise training decreased 
I/R‑induced damage by exerting cardioprotective effects 
through protecting myocardial mitochondria, increasing 
myocardial vascularization and maintaining cardiomyocyte 
integrity, thereby decreasing the release of the aforementioned 
enzymes. In addition, examination of HE‑stained myocardial 
sections revealed that the myocardium exhibited deformation 
and expansion, and the muscle fibers were arranged in a disor ‑
derly manner after myocardial I/R, and these changes were 
significantly reduced following treatment intervention with 
EXC and IPC.
The free radicals produced during myocardial I/R can 
activate NF‑ κB. Subsequently, TNF‑ α, which induces the tran ‑
scription of NF‑ κB, can directly damage vascular endothelial 
cells and cardiomyocytes (76). Functionally, TNF‑ α could 
trigger cellular responses via interacting with its transmem ‑
brane receptors, such as TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) (77). Upon 
activation by TNF‑ α, TNFR1 can activate the death induction 
signal mediated by TNF receptor‑associated death domain and 
Fas‑associated death domain in order to activate caspase‑3, ‑6 
and ‑8, and reduce the production of the anti‑apoptotic protein 
Bcl‑2, eventually causing apoptosis  (78,79).

LAI et al:  EFFECTS OF SWIMMING TRAINING ON MYOCARDIAL PROTECTION IN RATS 10
NF‑κB is a family of inducible transcription factors that 
serve a variety of evolutionarily conserved roles in the immune 
system. Cytokines belonging to the TNF family induce rapid 
transcription of genes regulating inflammation, cell survival, 
proliferation and differentiation, primarily through activation 
of the NF‑ κB pathway (80). IPC can impose mild oxidative 
stress on cells, which can activate NF‑ κB and induce Bcl‑2, 
which in‑turn reduce the extent of cardiomyocyte damage and 
apoptosis during the subsequent I/R process (81). Exercise can 
trigger short‑term inflammation, alongside an increase in white 
blood cells, oxidative stress and the levels of C‑reactive protein 
(CRP). Regular exercise reduces CRP, IL‑6 and TNF‑ α levels, 
and also increases the levels of anti‑inflammatory factors, such 
as IL‑4 and IL‑10 (82). The results of the present study demon ‑
strated that the concentration of TNF‑ α in the myocardial cells 
of both EXC and IPC  group rats decreased significantly, indi ‑
cating that exercise reduced the concentration of TNF‑ α and 
reduced the inflammatory and apoptotic responses to achieve 
cardioprotective effects.
Apoptosis and necrosis are two types of cell death induced 
by myocardial I/R. Apoptosis‑related genes, such as those of 
the Bcl‑2 or caspase families, are known components of the 
signaling pathway controlling apoptosis. The caspase family 
is a protease system that directly causes apoptosis. Activation 
of both the extrinsic and the intrinsic apoptotic pathway 
results in cleavage of caspase‑3, which activates the execu ‑
tion phase of apoptosis (82). Bcl‑2 enhances proton release 
from the mitochondria and exerts a regulatory effect on the 
opening of the mPTP, and therefore has an anti‑apoptotic 
effect  (83). Caspase‑3 is activated by intracytoplasmic 
release of mitochondrial proteins, such as cytochrome c and 
apoptosis‑inducing factor, which is restrained by Bcl‑2 and 
Bcl‑xL upstream of caspase. Furthermore, the expression 
of antiapoptotic genes, such as Bcl‑2 or Bcl‑xL, is activated 
by the suppression of the transcription factor NF‑ κB, which 
restrains apoptosis (81). It was previously demonstrated that 
IPC could attenuate caspase‑3 activation and increase Bcl‑2 
performance (84,85). These findings suggest that preven ‑
tion of caspase activation may contribute to myocardial 
protection.
The heat shock response is a common cellular reaction to 
external stimuli, such as ischemia, hypoxia, acidosis, oxidative 
stress, protein degradation, increased intracellular calcium and 
energy depletion; therefore, IPC can also activate the release 
of heat shock proteins (HSPs) (86,87). Exercise also increases 
the expression of cardiac HSPs, as a variety of stressors 
associated with exercise, including heat stress and hypoxia, 
reduced intracellular pH, ROS and reactive nitrogen species 
production, depletion of glucose and glycogen stores, increase 
in cytosolic calcium levels and cardiomyocyte stretching, can 
all contribute to HSP elevation in cardiac muscle (88). The 
protective effects of HSPs on cardiomyocytes include mainte ‑
nance of myocardial calcium ion concentration and a decrease 
in the release of pro‑inflammatory factors. HSPs can also 
regulate ATP synthesis in the mitochondria and affect signal 
transduction through the MAPK/JNK pathway to inhibit 
apoptosis and increase the anti‑apoptotic capacity in cardio ‑
myocytes (89‑91). Certain researchers even consider HSPs, in 
addition to Bcl‑2, as a type of anti‑apoptosis protein (90,92,93). 
The present study found that, in addition to a smaller infarct size in the EXC and the IPC groups, the extent of apoptosis 
and the expression of caspase‑3 in cardiomyocytes decreased 
considerably, while the expression of Bcl‑2 in cardiomyocytes 
in both groups increased substantially. By inference, this may 
result from an increase in HSP levels after swimming training 
and preconditioning of the rats, which strengthens the effect 
of cardioprotection induced by exercise, so as to improve 
the endurance of cardiomyocytes to ischemia and hypoxia, 
resulting in less severe MIRI. Future studies may combine 
measuring HSPs levels with other related signaling elements 
such that the cardioprotective mechanism of exercise can be 
further elucidated.
In this study, histomorphology, blood biochemistry, 
TUNEL staining and cardiomyocyte TNF‑ α, caspase‑3, and 
Bcl‑2 expression were used to measure the severity of MIRI. 
The results proved that swimming for 3 h daily for 4 contin ‑
uous weeks before MI decreased MI size, myocardial injury 
and cardiomyocyte apoptosis after myocardial I/R to achieve 
cardioprotective effects that were comparable to IPC. In the 
future, swimming training can be included in health promo ‑
tion to decrease mortality rates due to cardiovascular diseases 
and improve the health of people.
