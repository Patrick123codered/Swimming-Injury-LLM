Abstract  
This study is the first of its kind to investigate musculoskeletal injuries in Jordanian swimmers. It aimed to identify 
common sports injuries in male and female swimmers aged 18 to 25 in Jordan. The research involved 173 participants 
affiliated with the J ordanian Swimming Federation, using correlation and regression analysis. The study explored the 
intricate relationship between the age of starting swimming, training routines, and competitive involvement. It revealed 
negative correlations between the age o f initiation and various performance measures, indicating that starting 
swimming at a younger age is associated with increased competition participation, more training time, and longer 
training distances. Furthermore, a strong negative correlation was obse rved between the number of competitions and 
weekly training time, suggesting that more competitions require more training. Conversely, a positive correlation was 
found between weekly training distance and training time, indicating that longer training sess ions cover greater 
distances. It's important to note that these correlations do not imply causation, and other factors may contribute. 
Regression analysis revealed that the selected independent variables significantly influenced the prediction of swimming 
injuries, explaining around 37.3% of the variability. The number of competitions emerged as the most influential factor, 
negatively impacting injury prediction, meaning that more competitions were associated with fewer injuries. 
Additionally, variables lik e weekly training time, weekly training distance, and the age of starting swimming positively 
affected injury prediction. The study presented a predictive equation for estimating swimmers' injuries, providing 
valuable insights for injury prevention and ath lete well -being.

Introduction:         
The world has undergone a remarkable transformation, 
experiencing significant advancements across various 
disciplines including sports and sport related fields. For 
many years, the interest in sports has increased dramatically 
and it has become a special f eature for many societies, 
because of the many benefits of sports on the individual’s 
physical and psychological health, and how sport enhances 
the strength and solidity of society. Swimming is 
considered one of the most important sports activities that 
gain great support and attention, especially in countries 
bordering the seas ( Al-Hawamdeh, 2021)  and Trikha, et al., 
2022).  
     Swimming sport is an important water sport that has 
gained tremendous popularity, where its pioneers receive 
remarkable accolades for their achievements.  This is 
because swimming contributes to the integration of the 
individual’s personality in vario us ways. Swimming 
provides an excellent non -weight -bearing alternative to 
exercise for people of all age groups. It also has the ability 
to enhance cardiovascular fitness, muscular strength, and 
overall well -being without subjecting the body to the same 
level of strain as high -impact sports (Gračanin, et al.,2023).  
However, despite its seemingly gentle nature, swimming is 
not without risks, and swimmers are susceptible to musculoskeletal injuries that impact  on swimmers affecting 
their performance, training routines, and overall enjoyment 
of the sport. The repetitive nature of swimming strokes, 
combined with improper technique and inadequate warm -
up practices, can lead to a range of musculoskeletal issues, 
including shoulder impingement, rotator cuff injuries, knee 
pain, and lower back problems. The prevalence of these 
injuries highlights the need for a comprehensive 
understanding of their underlying factors and the 
development of effective preventive measures  (Al-Tani, 
Taha Ghafil 2021) . 
This study conducted an in -depth investigation into 
musculoskeletal injuries among Jordanian swimmers, a 
previously unexplored topic in the region. The research 
aimed to bridge the knowledge gap by identifying the most 
common musculoskeletal injuries in Jo rdanian swimmers 
and understanding the contributing factors, considering 
variables like gender, age, swimming techniques, training 
intensity, and competitive involvement. It also examined 
the impact of these injuries on athletic performance. The 
research i s crucial in the context of competitive swimming, 
an area where sports injuries have been relatively 
underexplored. The study focused on aspects with a direct 
impact on swimmers, distinguishing it from more 
generalized scientific investigations. The findin gs provide

policy and practice for the Jordanian Swimming Federation. 
The research leveraged participant insights and empirical 
evidence to develop effective injury prevention strategies, 
ultimately aiming to im prove swimmers' well -being and 
athletic performance while fostering a deeper appreciation 
for the sport.  
Methodology                                                                            
A comprehensive mixed -methods approach was employed, 
utilizing an internet -based survey distributed through 
Qualtrics to gather data from 173 swimmers who are 
affiliated with the Jordanian Swimming Federation (JSF). 
The survey, comprising 33 inquiries, inc orporated diverse 
question formats aimed at capturing information 
concerning demographics, musculoskeletal injuries, 
training practices, injury prevention strategies, and other 
relevant aspects. Subsequently, the amassed data underwent 
meticulous and rigor ous descriptive statistical analysis to 
elucidate trends and disparities between theoretical research 
findings and practical experiences. While the initial target 
sample size was originally intended to encompass 200 adult 
swimmers within the age range of 1 8-25, the final number 
settled at 173 questionnaires, which were considered 
suitable for thorough statistical analysis after eliminating 
responses that did not meet the required criteria for inclusion. Diverse online channels were employed for data 
collect ion, including social media platforms, direct 
communication with JSF, and online interviews. The 
collected data underwent careful processing using statistical 
software tailored for social sciences (SPSS), involving the 
calculation of correlation coefficien ts, as well as regression 
analysis, with a significance level established at p < 0.05 to 
ensure statistical validity.  
RESULTS  
Demographics  
Demographic data include age, age at which swimming 
started, number of competitions, gender, weekly training

Table 1 and figures (1 – 7) show that there were 173 
swimming participants. Almost 71.7% of the participants 
noted their age to be underlying within 18 to 20 years. 
Nearly 26.6% of them stated they were between the ages of 
21 to 23 years. The rest, 1.7% of  the survey candidates, 
highlighted their age to be within 24 to 26 years. The age 
ranges at which the participants have started swimming 
have been grouped as follows: 5 -10 ,11 -15 ,16 -20 and 21 
-25; 62.2%,12.8 % , 22.1% and 2.9% respectively. The 
percen t number of competitions were as follows: (zero; 
40%), (1 -5; 6%), (6 -10; 3%) and (> 10; 51%). For gender, 
percentage was distributed as 58% for male and 42% for 
female. The percentage WTT of participants was conducted 
for the following categories: less tha n 5, 5 -10, more than 
10, distributed as follows: 45.7 %, 6.4 %, and 48 % 
respectively. The percentage of the WTD of the participants was carried out for the following categories: less than 5 , 5 
-10 , more than 10,  distributed as follows 44%, 8% , 48%, 
respectively. Since participants competed with more than 
one swimming style, the total of the 173 participants’ styles 
have been reported, including freestyle (49%), breaststroke 
(21.1%), backstroke (17%), and butterfly style (13%).  
 
Correlation analysis  
Correlation analysis is a method of measuring the 
correlation of two data sets. The correlation method is used 
to measure the movement of two data ranges, that is, the 
similarity between the large values of one set and the high 
values of the other set (+R), the correlations between the 
small values of one set and the large values of the other set 
(- R), or the values of both sets  that are unrelated (zero

was used and analysis results are shown in  table 2.  
As shown in table 2 a negative correlation was found 
between age at which the participant started swimming  on 
one hand, and the number of competitions, weekly  training 
time and weekly training distance on other hand, where  (r 
= - 0.714 , -0.701 and -0.661, respectively, p < 0.001). Negative correlation also shown between number of 
competitions and (weekly training time; 0.948), (age at

Multiple Linear  Regression (MLR):  
Multiple linear regression method has been carried out to 
predict swimming injuries (dependent variable) as a result 
of several independent variables. The selected independent 
variables used in this study were the number of competition, 
swimming age start (SAS), weekly training time (WTT), 
and weekly training distance (WTD).  
According to results, the sum of what independent variables 
explain in terms of the variance in swimming injuries was 
0.373 table (3) were R2  equals 623 and adjusted R2 equals 
0.373,  at statically significant level less than 0.05 table (4). According to Beta value shown in table (5) the number of 
competitions has the highest effect with Beta = -0.377, then 
WTT, WTD and SAS with Beta value equal 0.185, 0.405 
and 0.488, respectively. Based on these results the equation 
of prediction for swimming injuries is  as follow  
 
Swimmers’ Injuries = - 0.377* Number of   competitions 
+ 0.185 * WTT + 0.405 * WTD + 0.488* SAS .

Discussion : 
The findings presented in Table 2 highlight significant 
correlations among various factors related to swimming 
performance. These correlations shed light on the complex 
interplay between the age at which individuals start 
swimming, their training regimen, and their competitive 
involvement.  
Firstly, a negative correlation was observed between the 
age at which individuals began swimming and several 
performance metrics. Specifically, a negative correlation 
coefficient (r) of -0.714, -0.701, and -0.661 was determined 
between the age of swimming initiation and the number of 
competitions, weekly training time, and weekly training 
distance, respectively. This suggests that individuals who 
commenced swimming at an earlier age tended to participate in more competitions, allocate more time to 
weekly tr aining, and cover greater distances during their 
training sessions. Moreover, the negative correlation 
between the number of competitions and various other 
factors was also evident. Notably, a strong negative 
correlation of -0.948 was detected between the number of 
competitions and weekly training time, as well as a negative 
correlation of -0.714 with the age at which swimming 
commenced, and -0.890 with weekly training distance. 
These findings imply that participants engaging in a higher 
number of swimming competitions typically devoted more 
time to weekly training, commenced swimming at a 
younger age, and covered greater training distances. 
Furthermore, a robust positive correlation was identified 
between weekly training distance and weekly training time, 

Mahmoud Almomani 
 
 
JASS   37  December  2023 , Volume 13, No. 2 with a correlation coefficient of 0.944. This implies that 
individuals who trained over longer distances during their 
weekly sessions also tended to allocate more time to 
training overall.  
In a scientific context, these correlations can be attributed 
to several factors. The negative correlation between the age 
of swimming initiation and performance metrics could be 
linked to the notion that starting training at a younger age 
allows for more years of skill development and practice, 
leading to enhanced performance. The negative correlation 
between the number of competitions and training time 
might suggest that athletes engaging in more competitions 
require more training to maintain their compet itive edge. 
The positive correlation between weekly training distance 
and training time might be indicative of a comprehensive 
training approach where longer sessions facilitate covering 
greater distances. It's important to note that these 
correlations do not necessarily imply causation; other 
unaccounted factors could also influence the observed 
relationships. Nevertheless, the scientific significance of 
these findings underscores the intricate relationships 
between the timing of skill acquisition, trainin g intensity, 
and competitive involvement in the realm of swimming 
performance.  
The results of the regression analysis, as presented in Table 
3, reveal that the combined influence of independent 
variables on explaining the variance in swimming injuries 
is approximately 37.3%. This assessment is corroborated by 
the R -squared value of 0 .623 and the adjusted R -squared 
value of 0.373, both of which are consistent with a 
statistically significant level below 0.05 (as indicated in 
Table 4). These metrics collectively suggest that the 
selected independent variables have a substantial impact o n 
the prediction of swimming injuries.  
Upon closer examination of the Beta values provided in 
Table 5, it becomes evident that the number of competitions 
emerges as the most influential factor. With a Beta value of 
-0.377, it exerts a negative effect on the prediction of 
injuries, implying that  an increase in the number of 
competitions is associated with a decrease in the incidence 
of injuries. On the other hand, variables such as WTT (with 
a Beta value of 0.185), WTD (with a Beta value of 0.405), 
and SAS (with a Beta value of 0.488) also exhibi t 
noteworthy effects on predicting swimming injuries, 
though in a positive manner.  
Taken together, the outcomes of the analysis furnish us with 
a predictive equation for estimating swimmers' injuries: 
Swimmers’ Injuries = -0.377 * Number of Competitions + 
0.185 * WTT + 0.405 * WTD + 0.488 * SAS. This equation 
encapsulates the interplay b etween the key factors 
contributing to swimming injuries, elucidating the relative 
importance of each independent variable. It is evident that 
while the number of competitions appears to act as a 
protective factor, the other variables - WTT, WTD, and 
SAS - seem to correlate with an increased likelihood of 
injuries. These findings provide valuable insights for 
practitioners and researchers in the field of swimming 
sports, aiding in the development of targeted injury 
prevention strategies and training protoco ls to enhance 
athletes' well -being and performance. However, it's important to acknowledge the limitations of the model. 
While the explanatory power is significant, it doesn't 
encompass all the factors that might contribute to injury 
variability in swimmin g. This suggests the possibility of 
unaccounted variables that could also influence injury 
occurrences. Future research could delve into these 
additional factors to create a more comprehensive 
understanding of swimming injuries. Overall, the analysis 
provi des a robust foundation for advancing the knowledge 
surrounding swimming injuries and lays the groundwork 
for informed decision -making in the field.  
Conclusion : 
This study delved into the realm of swimming performance 
and injury prevention among Jordanian swimmers. The 
research uncovered significant correlations between the age 
at which individuals commence swimming, their training 
habits, and their participation in competitions. Notably, 
starting swimming at a younger age correlated with 
increased involvement in competitions, more extensive 
weekly training, and greater training distances. These 
findings suggest that early exposure to swimming fosters 
skill develop ment and performance improvement over the 
years, highlighting the importance of an early start. 
Moreover, the study revealed that a higher number of 
competitions was associated with increased training time 
and more extensive training distances. Athletes 
participating in more competitions seemed to dedicate 
additional time to training to maintain their competitive 
edge. This underscores the demand for comprehensive 
training routines to support the demands of competitive 
swimming. The regression analysis furt her demonstrated 
that the number of competitions played a pivotal role in 
predicting swimming injuries. Surprisingly, a higher 
number of competitions was linked to a lower incidence of 
injuries, suggesting that competitive swimmers might have 
injury -preven tive advantages. However, other factors like 
weekly training time, weekly training distance, and the 
starting age of swimming also had notable effects on 
predicting swimming injuries. The study provides a 
predictive equation for estimating swimmers' injuri es. 
While the number of competitions acts as a protective 
factor, other variables, including weekly training time, 
weekly training distance, and the starting age of swimming, 
appear to correlate with an increased likelihood of injuries. 
These findings offe r valuable insights for practitioners and 
researchers in the field of swimming sports, aiding in the 
development of targeted injury prevention strategies and 
training protocols to enhance athletes' well -being and 
performance.  
Recommendations : 
Based on the findings of this study on musculoskeletal 
injuries among Jordanian swimmers, several 
recommendations can be made. First, early initiation of 
swimming is encouraged to promote skill development and 
performance. Sports programs and schools shoul d 
incorporate swimming into curricula. Second, swimmers 
should balance the number of competitions with adequate 
training and coaches should provide guidelines for 
competition frequency. Third, comprehensive training 
programs emphasizing proper techniques, warm -up

JASS   38  December  2023 , Volume 13, No. 2 exercises, and longer training sessions should be developed. 
Regular health assessments and access to sports medicine 
professionals are crucial. Lastly, age -appropriate training 
programs should be tailored to swimmers' developmental stages, focusing on physical development and skill 
acquisition. Implementing these recommendations can 
enhance the well -being and performance of swimmers in 
Jordan while fostering a deeper appreciation for the sport.
