Abstract
Study aim : This study aimed to determine the knowledge and skills of swimming coaches in providing first aid and cardiopul -
monary resuscitation (CPR). 
Material and methods : The sample consisted of 59 swimming coaches who responded to non-standardized questionnaire. The 
collected data were processed by the statistical program IBM SPSS (20.0), using the Chi-square test with cross-tabulation, with 
a level of statistical significance p ≤ 0.05. 
Results : Obtained data showed a statistically significant difference in the knowledge of swimming coaches about first aid and 
CPR in relation to coaching experience (p = 0.025); in the knowledge of providing first aid and CPR between coaches who 
have a certificate of first aid and CPR and those who do not (p = 0.006) and in first aid and CPR knowledge between coaches 
who have renewed their first aid and CPR knowledge and those who did not (p = 0.045). 
Conclusion : Based on the findings of the present study, swimming coaches included in this research did not have enough 
knowledge and skills in first aid and CPR, which makes swimming programs unsafe. By obliging swimming coaches to acquire 
and constantly improve their knowledge and skills in first aid and CPR, the environment for all swimming programs would 
become safer.

Introduction
Swimming has a positive impact on children and 
adults. Children and adult swimmers are safer in and 
around the water environment than non-swimmers. These 
are perhaps the two most important reasons for the pres -
ence of a large number of children and adults attending 
various organized forms of swimming lessons. Never -
theless, swimming activities and swimming training are 
performed in the water, potentially dangerous environ -
ment where fatal outcomes can occur. The presence of 
lifeguards on the water, as well as a visibly marked first 
aid and CPR kit, during the organization of an event on 
the water surface, which includes all kinds of swimming 
training sessions are legal obligations. In case of an injury 
or unsafe situation, swimming coaches should be able to 
provide first aid and resuscitation in a  timely and efficient 
manner. After successfully preventing drowning or some 
other injury that might occur in the swimming pool, until 
the arrival of professional medical help, properly provided 
first aid and resuscitation are essential and can save a  life. Watersports in swimming pools are considered healthy 
and are always recommended for children and adults as 
a form of recreation. Each sport has its specifics by which 
it is recognizable and, as such, is attractive to a  particular 
subset of the general population. A  large number of chil -
dren are involved in swimming because it has a positive 
effect on their growth and development. There is a pos-
sibility of drowning during swimming training, so swim -
mers and coaches must be careful.  Other injuries that can 
occur are a consequence of the structure of the movements 
performed by swimmers. In all activities in which specific 
movements are performed in a much larger number than 
the usual number of repetitions, injuries could occur. In 
swimming and water polo, the movement structures are 
similar, thus injuries of the spine, shoulder joint, and knee 
joint are common. According to some authors, the most 
common injury in swimmers is a  shoulder injury [1,  2], 
which occurs in 40–91% of cases [3]. Knee injuries are 
the second most common in swimming [4]. A  survey of 
36 competitive swimmers found that 86% of the sample 
reported at least one episode of sore knees [5]. The spi -
nal column is also recognized as a location predisposed

to injuries in elite swimmers. [6] Reported that 33.3% of 
swimmers who swim the dolphin technique and 22.2% 
of swimmers who swim the breaststroke technique have 
experienced back pain. [7] Determined a  50% incidence 
of back pain for swimmers swimming the butterfly stroke 
and 47% for breaststroke swimmers. Ear infections are 
also present as a consequence of the presence of bac -
teria in swimming pools. In addition to injuries caused 
by repeating the exact movements of the arms and legs 
(monostructural sport), all kind of swimmers can be in -
jured in the pool in other ways as well. A  study of inju -
ries at swimming pools in Austria, which included 764 
pool attendants, showed that 19% of injuries were lip in -
juries and 11.3% were dental injuries [8]. Due to a slip-
pery floor, running around the pool or pushing by another 
person can suffer forearm injuries due to a  fall. Injuries 
caused by diving in the pool are often catastrophic and 
have long-term consequences for both the injured and 
their families [9].
In countries where awareness of the importance of 
having the knowledge of first aid and its application ex -
ists, programs are being implemented for parents whose 
children are enrolled in swimming schools. In the Unit -
ed States, such program has contributed to improving 
the knowledge and skills of providing first aid to parents 
whose children are engaged in swimming. Compared to 
the level of knowledge of 47.3% at the beginning of the 
program, the average score immediately after the end 
of the program was 93.5% (t = –12.176, p < 0.01) [10]. 
Physical education teachers were examined about their 
knowledge of first aid for dental injuries [11]. Among the 
examined teachers, 64% did not know what to do when 
a tooth fell out, while 43% knew. Although there is a legal 
obligation that the presence of lifeguards is mandatory at 
swimmers’ training in Serbia, their presence is noticeable 
in a very small number of pools. The lifeguards are mostly 
young people, quite inexperienced, poorly paid, and per -
haps insufficiently motivated to work in such responsible 
duty. As adolescents and young people, many lifeguards 
are unprepared to deal with the responsibility of their posi -
tions [12]. In such circumstances, it would be of great im -
portance for swimming coaches in the Republic of Serbia 
to have theoretical knowledge and skills to provide first 
aid and CPR when necessary. The aim of this study is to 
determine the level of knowledge and skills of providing 
first aid and CPR of swimming coaches.
Material and methods
The sample consisted of 59 male coaches (aged 18–50; 
work experience of 1–30 years), from the Autonomous 
Province of V ojvodina, who voluntarily participated in 
the research. According to the coaching experience, there were three groups of coaches. The first group of coaches is 
the group with the least experience (1–10 years), the sec -
ond group (11–20 years) with medium experience and the 
third group (21–30 years) with the most experience. The 
research had an empirically non-experimental character 
of the transversal type, in which a non-standardized ques -
tionnaire was used (Appendix). For the swimming train -
ing safety in the area of AP V ojvodina, the knowledge and 
skills of providing first aid and CPR of swimming coaches 
are of great importance. For the purposes of this research, 
it was necessary to create a questionnaire. The question -
naire consisted of questions about having a first aid certifi -
cate and CPR, experience in providing first aid and CPR 
and existence of a first aid kit and CPR at the pool where 
they work. The collected data were processed by the sta -
tistical program IBM SPSS (20.0), using the Chi-square 
test with cross-tabulation, with a level of statistical signifi -
cance p ≤ 0.05. 
Results 
Table 1 shows the results of the analysis of whether 
the knowledge and skills of swimming coaches differ in 
relation to the years of coaching experience. Statistically 
significant differences (p = 0.025) regarding the knowl -
edge of first aid and CPR were found between coaches in 
relation to their experience. Coaches (N = 12) with experi -
ence up to 10 years have knowledge of first aid and CPR, 
while their older colleagues with decades of experience 
(21 to 30 years) do not have such knowledge. In the group 
of coaches (N = 17) with coaching experience of 11 to 20 
years, only two of them knew how to provide first aid and 
CPR. No statistically significant difference (p = 0.131) 
was found between the years of coaching experience and 
their first aid and CPR skills. The most skilled in provid -
ing first aid were coaches with coaching experience up to 
10 years, and the least skilled coaches (N = 6) with coach -
ing experience from 20 to 30 years.
 It was also determined whether there is a difference in 
the ability to provide first aid and CPR between coaches 
who own first aid and CPR certificate and those coaches 
who do not (Table 2). There was a statistically significant 
difference (p = 0.006) in the knowledge of first aid and 
CPR between coaches who have and those who do not 
have this certificate. The majority of coaches (58.3%), al -
though they have a first aid certificate and CPR, did not 
give correct answers in the questionnaire. 
The results of the research (Table 3) indicated that 
the largest number of coaches, as many as 71.2%, did 
not renewed their knowledge of first aid and CPR, and 
there is a statistically significant difference (p = 0.045) 
in the knowledge of first aid and CPR between coaches 
who renewed their knowledge and those who did not. The

majority of coaches (N = 10) who renewed their knowl -
edge of first aid and CPR, according to the answers given 
in the questionnaire, did not confirm it (Table 3).
By analyzing the correct answers from the survey, the 
skills of providing first aid and CPR to the swimming 
coach were assessed. As many as 34 coaches would have 
reacted wrongly if they encountered emergency situations, 
which were described in the survey. It can be said that the 
knowledge of swimming coaches about providing first aid 
and CPR is insufficient.
In addition to knowledge and skills, successful first 
aid requires a positive attitude of the coach towards this 
skill and its continuous improvement. It is expected that 
the coaches are ready to continuously improve their first 
aid skills. Positive attitude (desire and will) towards the 
continuous improvement of knowledge and skills of first 
aid and CPR, expressed by 57 swimming coaches.
Discussion
A survey was conducted on a sample of 59 swimming 
coaches, who teach children aged 6–18 to swim or conduct 
a training process on them. The safety of young swimmers 
in the pools where the tested coaches are employed is low. 
Most of the coaches (N = 46) reported that there were no 
first aid kits and CPRs at the pools where they were em -
ployed, as well as lifeguards during the training. Only 39 
swimming coaches were certified to provide first aid and 
CPR. Each respondent confirmed that the safety of swim -
mers is very important. Out of a total of 59 coaches, 14 of 
them would know and 38 would be able to provide first 
aid and CPR. This result is very worrying. Unfortunately, 
there are many worrying examples. A  questionnaire was 
conducted on football officials responsible for dealing with injuries, who note that 34 out of 86 examinees had 
a first aid certificate [13]. In Northern Ireland and the 
Republic of Ireland, a survey was conducted on physical 
education teachers and coaches from 450 schools. Based 
on the analyzed answers, it was determined that 37% of 
physical education teachers did not renew their knowl -
edge of first aid [14]. In England, the qualifications and 
knowledge of first aid among coaches and officials in 
five non-elite youth sports were determined. It was found 
that 80% of respondents have an updated first aid certifi -
cate, but around 50% of total participants did not know 
how to react properly in “collapsed player” and “choking 
player” scenario [15]. Survey conducted in Turkey indi -
cates insufficient level of knowledge about first aid among 
surveyed preschool teachers [16], primary school teach -
ers [17], physical education teachers [18], and university 
sports team coaches [19]. Coaches are important figure in 
transfering their knowledge and skills to younger and less 
experienced athletes. 
The most inexperienced trainers had the most knowl -
edge in providing first aid and CPR. It could be assumed 
that younger coaches were trained for the profession of 
coach, so they are more aware of the importance of the 
aspect of children’s safety in training. More experienced 
coaches worked as coaches as additional work, without 
any training. They did not have the opportunity to acquire 
knowledge and skills in the field of this research. Know -
ing that the safety of swimmers is of critical importance, 
American Red Cross has a program named “Safety train -
ing for Swim Coaches” and has made it mandatory for 
every swimming coach across US. This program had the 
aim to inform swimmers about possible life-threatening 
situations in the water and around water and techniques 
and skills to prevent and deal with them [20]. Most of the 
surveyed coaches work with children, so they would have Table 3. Frequencies of knowledge in first aid between coaches who renew first aid and CPR knowledge and those who do not

to master this knowledge and skills from a professional 
and especially ethical point of view. Possession of a cer-
tificate implies a level of training in an area. Coaches and 
administrators have an ethical responsibility to prepare 
for emergency care situations [21]. The obtained results 
of this research deny this fact because more coaches with -
out a first aid certificate and CPR had more knowledge 
than their colleagues with the mentioned certificate. This 
result can be a consequence of not using the mentioned 
knowledge and learned skills or poorly performed first 
aid and CPR certification renewal. In addition to knowl -
edge and skills, successful first aid and CPR requires self-
confidence, courage, and a positive attitude of the coach. 
A positive attitude could contribute to encouraging and 
raising the necessary self-confidence to master at least the 
basic knowledge and skills of first aid and CPR. Most of 
the swimming coaches included in this research expressed 
a positive attitude. This indicates that coaches are aware of 
the risks that can occur in the pool and the importance of 
having the knowledge and skills in providing first aid and 
CPR to those who need it. Safety conditions for swimming 
training on the territory of AP V ojvodina are at a low level, 
so it would be best to oblige all coaches by law to attend 
a first aid course and CPR. Swimming coaches do not of -
ten come to the situation that they have to save someone’s 
life or provide first aid and CPR, so it would be good to 
periodically update their knowledge or raise it to a higher 
level. Even short lessons in CPR could improve self-con -
fidence of medical and non-medical personnel [22]. The 
results of this research indicate that most coaches do not 
renew their knowledge of first aid and CPR. Training on 
providing CPR for volunteers has been organized in the 
UK. Six months after the training, of the total sample, only 
7% managed to perform CPR safely [23]. Failure to renew 
previously learned knowledge and skills reduces the qual -
ity of their performance and self-confidence. 
The limitations of this research are a small number of 
coaches who agreed to participate in the research and test -
ing of first aid and CPR skills. A  limitation of this study 
was the use of a non-standardized questionnaire, which 
was constructed for our study, so the results obtained can -
not be compared with similar research. A wide range of 
coaches age and work experience are llimitation also. 
Conslusions
The swimming coaches included in this research did 
not show enough knowledge and skills in providing first 
aid and CPR, which makes most of the swimming pro -
grams unsafe. Lifeguards are present at a small number of 
swimming pools in AP V ojvodina (Serbia) during swim -
ming training, and life-threatening situations can occur. 
Every coach should know how and be able to provide first aid and CPR. It is encouraging that less experienced 
coaches have better first aid and CPR skills compared to 
experienced coaches, despite the fact that some of the 
older coaches have a first aid and CPR certificate. Young 
swimmers could be safer if their coaches knew how to 
provide first aid and CPR. By obliging swimming coaches 
to attend first aid and CPR courses, the safety in swim -
ming programs would be improved. The knowledge and 
capability of providing first aid and CPR skills could be 
a condition for obtaining a national license to work on the 
pool.
