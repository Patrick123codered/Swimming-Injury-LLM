 
1 The effects  of Swimming  Fatigue  on Shoulder  Strength,  Range  of Motion,  Joint  Control,  and 
Performance  in Swimmers.   
 
Abstract  
Purpose:  To investigate  the effects  of training  induced  fatigue  on shoulder  strength,  ROM,  
joint position  sense , and stroke  length  in elite competitive  swimmers . 
Methods:  Seventeen  national  level  swimmers  performed  maximum  isometric  strength  
(internal  and external  rotation) , ROM , and joint position  sense  tests before  and after a 
fatiguing  8x100m  training  set. Stroke  length,  heart  rate, blood lactate  and blood  glucose  
level s were  recorde d throughout.  
Results:  Peak  blood  lactate , blood  glucose  levels , and heart  rate increase d significantly  
(P<0.001) post-training  confirming  fatigue.  Reductions  were  observed  in stroke  length  of 
both arms  (P<0.0 01), external  rotation  range  of motion  (P<0.00 1, -5.29°,  Right  shoulder;  
P=0.04,  -3.18°,  Left shoulder)  and joint position  sense  in their dominant  (breathing  side)  arm 
(P=0.03).   
Conclusions:  This investigation  revealed  a reduction  in stroke  length  across  both arms  and 
also an arm bias in swimming  whereby  a greater  reduction  in both external  rotation  range  
and joint position  sense  was observed  in the dominant  arm when  fatigued.  This has 
highlighted  a relationship  between  fatigue  and potential  mechanism  of shoulder  pathology  in 
swimmers.   
 
 
 
 
 
2 Introduction  
 
Shoulder  pain in swimming  is a major  cause  for concern  (Beach  et al., 1992 ; Yanai  & Hay., 
2000 ; Wolf  et al., 2009 ; Lynch  et al., 2010 ; Tate et al., 2012 ), with shoulder  injuries  
occurring  in  30% to 91% of swimmers  (Beach  et al., 1992;  Wolf  et al., 2009 ; Walker  et al., 
2011;   Tate et al., 2012),  and a wide  acceptance  that shoulder  pain is a normal  part of 
swimming  (Hibberd  & Myer s., 2013 ). This pathology,  often  characterised  as pain following  
repeated  shoulder  impingement  in swimmers , is described  as “swimmers  shoulder ” [sic] 
(Kennedy  and Hawkins , 1974 ). 
 
Competitive  swimmers  practice  6 -7 days a week , swim  on average  between  10,000m  and 
14,000m  on each day (Kluemper  et al., 2006;  Lynch  et al., 2010;  Sein et al., 2010 ; 
Allegrucci  et al., 1995), and perform  an estimated  16000 - 25000  shoulder  rotations  during  a 
typical  training  week  (Scovazzo  et al. 1991).  With  80% of training  time spent  on freesty le 
stroke  (Beach  et al., 1992) , and 90% of the propulsion  for this coming  from  the upper  
extremities  (Barbosa  et al., 2008),  excessive  training  volumes  has been  identified  as a 
possible  contributing  factor  to shoulder  pathology  (Beach  et al., 1992;  Tate et al., 2012;  
Walker  et al., 2011;  Wolf  et al., 2009;  Hibberd  & Myers ., 2013 ).  There  is a clear  
relationship  between  distances  trained  and shoulder  pathology , with swimmers  who train for 
longer  distances  appear ing up to four times  as likely  to have  a shoulde r pathology  as those  
who train for less (Beach  et al., 1992 ; Tate et al., 2012;  Walker  et al., 2011;  Sein et al., 
2010).   
 
Mechanisms  of overuse  shoulder  injury  appear  to be related  to the inability  to maintain  
optimal  posture  and movement  patterns,  resulting  in continuous  aggravation  of susceptible  
tissues  that is worsened  under  fatigue  due to detriments  in strength,  proprioception,  and 
 
3 ROM  (Beach  et al., 1992;  Rupp  et al., 1995;  Pink & Tibone,  2000;  Yanai  & Hay,  2000;  
Kluemper  et al., 2006;  Lynch  et al., 2010) . Competitive  swimmers  with decreased  muscle  
endurance  in external  rotation  and abduction  may be more  likely  to develop  shoulder  
pathology  (Beach  et al., 1992).  This may be compounded  by a protracted  shoulder  posture  
further  predisposing  swimmers  to a higher  risk of shoulder  injuries  (Kluemper  et al., 2006;  
Lynch  et al., 2010;  Pink & Tibone,  2000).  If infraspinatus  or teres  minor  are weak,  not 
activating  correctly,  or are fatigued  (Tyler et al., 2000;  Michener  et al., 2003;  Koester  et al., 
2005;  Heyworth  and Williams  2009;  Ellenbecker  and Cools  2010;  Heyworth  and Page  
2011 ), or if the scapula  is already  in a forward  position , preventing  further  protraction,  
(Kluemper  et al., 2006;  Lynch  et al., 2010;  Pink & Tibone,  2000) , abnormal  movement  of 
the gleno -humeral  and scapulothoracic  joints  may predispose  an athlete  to compression  of 
the sub-acromial  space,  leading  to impingement  of supraspinatus  tendon  and the subacromia l 
bursa  (Yanai  & Hay,  2000;  Lynch  et al., 2010).  Shoulder  weakness  or fatigue  in outer  range  
may result  in rotator  cuff impingement,  predominantly  of supraspinatus  during  the abduction  
and internal  rotation  that is characteristic  of the recovery  phase  of the freestyle  stroke  (Yanai  
& Hay,  2000).   
 
It is also possible  that there  is a disparity  in the levels  of fatigue  observed  in different  
muscles.  In tennis,  Ellenbecker  & Roetert  (1999)  observed  that the internal  rotator  muscles  
were  more  fatigue  resistant  than external  rotators.  Although  this may not directly  replicate  
fatigu e in swimming,  the relative  shift in internal  and external  rotator  strength  with fatigue  
may indicate  that internal  rotators  retain  more  strength  under fatigue  than the much  smaller  
external  rotators.  Indeed,  there is some  evidence  that training  the external  rotators  has a 
positive  effect  on reducing  shoulder  pain in swimmers  (Lynch  et al., 2010).   
 
 
4 As well as detriments  to strength,  several  studies  have also identified  a detrimental  effect  of 
fatigue  on proprioception  (Skinner  et al., 1986;  Lee et al., 2003),  with as much  as a 73% 
increase  in the threshold  of detection  of movement  (Carpenter  et al., 1993).  This may have  
implications  for the accurate  replication  of movement  patterns  that are central  to both 
performance  and injury  prevention.   
 
These cumulative  effects  of fatigue  on strength,  range  of motion , and proprioception  appear  
to have  a profound  impact  on swimming  performance.  Figueiredo  et al., (2012)  found  while 
testing  10 male  competitive  swimmers  aged  21.6 (± 2.4) with 11.00  years  of comp etitive  
swimming , a significant  decrease  in biomechanical  and coordinative  parameters  of 
swimmers  occurred  under  fatigu e. Speed  decreased  by 13.8%  (P=0.00),  stroke  rate 
(frequency)  by 5.1%  (P=0.00)  and stroke  length  by 6.9%  (P=0.01 ) with an increase  in blood  
lactate  levels  of 11.12  mmol-1 (±1.65  mmol-1). This test was able to show  biomechanical  
changes  due to fatigue,  but only over a very short  period  of time (96.1  seconds  ±2.1);  this is 
representative  of a race distance  but does not mimic  the cumulative  effects  of training.  It 
does however  show  that swim mers  have  reduced  joint control  and proprioception , which  
may contrib ute to pathology  under  fatigue  (Carpenter  et al., 1993).   
 
Previous  work  has suggested  that spatial  trajectory  and stroke  parameters  of intern ational  
swimmers  is not easily  changed  even  by the impairments  imposed  by fatigue,  suggest ing 
that stroke  rate becomes  the most  determinant  factor  of swimming  velocity  for top level  
swimmers  and not stroke  length  (Anjouannet  et al., 2006 ; Toussanit  et al., 2006) . When  
power  output  declines,  both swim  speed  and stroke  rate decrease , but stroke  length  remains  
constant  (Toussanit  et al., 2006) . It appears  that the more  experienced  the swimmer  the less 
deviation  in stroke  length  while  under  fatigue (Figueiredo  et al., 2012;  Anjouannet  et al., 
 
5 2006)  and may be a factor  in the reduced  occurrence  in shoulder  pathology  observed  in more  
experienced  swimmers  (Wolf  et al., 2009) .  
 
It is therefore  hypothesised  that interventions  that mitigate  fatigue  and promote  the 
maintenance  of optimal  posture,  proprioception,  mobility,  and movement  patterns  during  
swimming  may reduce  the chances  of shoulder  pathology.   To identify  potentially  helpful  
interventions  this study  aims  to investigate  the impact  of training  induced  fatigue  on 
strength,  mobility,  joint reposition  ability,  and parameters  of performance.  
 
 
 
Methodology  
 
Participants  
Seventeen  national  level  youth  (8 male,  9 female)  swimmers  from  a North  West  swimming  
squad , aged  15.9 years  (±1.09),  height  174cm  (±7.52cm),  weight  66.06kg  (±8.07kg) , were  
targeted  as part of a convenience  sample  and invited  to participate .  The seventeen  
participants  constituted  every  member  of the youth  squad . Each  participant  gave informed  
consent  prior  to participation  and gave permission  for all collected  data to be used in this 
study.  All swimmers  competed  regularly  at national  level  championships , were  right  hand  
dominant,  had approximately  7 years  of regular  training  experience , and considered  freestyle  
their preferred  stroke . Ethical  approval  was gained  prior  to the study  from  the institution’s  
RGEC.   
Testing  procedure  
 
6 Swimmers  completed  their normal  standardised,  pre-training , warm  up (1600m  
consisting  of full stroke,  arms  only,  legs only,  and drills)  before  having  baseline  
blood  lactate  and glucose  level s recorded .  
 
Maximum  isometric  strength  was measured  in internal  and external  rotation  using  a 
handheld  dynamometer  that had been  calibrated  with digital  scales  to a known  
weight  and had previously  been  deemed  to be a reliable  method  (Dover  and Powers,  
2003 ). Swimmers  stood  upright  and each arm was positioned  in 90° of shoulder  
abduction  and 90° of elbow  flexion  in the frontal  plane.  The swimmer  then 
positioned  themsel f so that the hand  held dynamometer  (Micro  FET 2, Hoggan  
Health  Industries)  could  be pressed  maximally  against  a pillar,  with the swimmers  
pressing  forwards  (to measure  internal  rotation  strength)  and backwards  (to measure  
external  rotation  strength).  This position  was chosen  as it was deemed  to be the most  
suitable  compromise  between  replicating  the arm position  during  the stroke,  while  
also being  repeatable . Three  attempts  were  taken  with the best score  being  recorded.  
Pilot  testing  was conducted  on the swimmers  prior  to this study,  during  which  the 
repeatability  of each,  measure  was determined  using  intra-class  correlation  
coefficient  (model  2,1). The comparison  of first and second  measurement  indicated  a 
strong  correlation  between  the two measures  of .96 (p<0.01)  (internal  rotation)  and 
.92 (p<0.01)  (external  rotation).   
 
Internal  and external  range  of motion  was assessed  at the glenohumoral  joint using  a 
goniometer  (Baseline  HiRes , 12-1000HR)  with arm abducted  to 90°, elbow  flexed  at 
90° while  lying  on a mobile  plinth.  Swimmers  were  then instructed  to actively  move  
their arm as far as they were  able into internal  and external  rotation.  Pilot  testing  was 
 
7 conducted  on the swimmers  prior  to this study,  during  which  the repeatability  of 
each,  measure  was determined  using  intra-class  correlation  coefficient  (model  2,1). 
The comparison  of first and second  measurement  indicated  a strong  correlation  
between  the two measures  of .92 (p<0.01)  (internal  rotation)  and .93 (external  
rotation)  (p<0.01).   
 
Joint  position  sense  was measured  with swimmers  lying  prone  with arm abducted  to 
90°, elbow  flexed  at 90°. The arm was then passively  externally  rotated  to 45° before  
returning  to the initial  position . With their eyes closed  swimmers  were  asked  to relax  
and then to resume  the arm position  (Herrington  et al., 2010).   
 
Following  the initial  test session,  swimmers  performed  8 x 100m  training  swims  off a 2-
minute  interval . Target  times  were  prescribed  for each swimmer  based  on 85% of their best 
100m  times  (Maglischo,  2003;  Barden  & Kell,  2009) . The 8 x 100m  swim  set of a 2-minute  
interval  is a regular  training  session  undertaken  by these  participants  and was chosen  as it 
was deemed  by the coaches  as the most  reliable  method  of inducing  fatigue  and that was 
also representative  of typical  training  practice.  
 
Immediately  on completion  of the last swim,  swimmers  exited  the pool and repeated  
the isometric  strength , range  of motion,  and joint position  tests. Efforts  were  made  to 
ensure  that this began  as soon  as possible  post-swim  (within  60s) and that the order  
and timing  of the post-fatigue  tests replicated  those  of the pre-fatigue  tests. 
Blood  sample s were  taken  3 minutes  post-exercise  (Gore,  2000 ; Maglischo,  2003 ; 
Aujouannet  et al., 2006 ). 
 
 
8 Swim  stroke  was recorded  using  a high-speed  camera  (Panasonic  Lumix  FT5)  at 30 frames  
per second  (Anjouannet  et al., 2006 ; Toussanit  et al., 2006)  and was analysed  using  Quintic , 
using  the 3rd 25m of each 100m  swim.  (Figure  1). 
 
Data  analysis  
All data were  analysed  using  SPSS  (Version  20) with ANOVA  and post-hoc tests used to 
determine  difference  pre to post fatigue .  Prior  to analysis  both visual  inspection  of the 
histogram  and Shapiro -Wilk  results  (no sig deviation  from  normality)  indicated  the data 
were  normally  distributed.  Pearson’s  correlation  coefficient  was used to determine  the 
correlations  between  stroke  length  and the tested  variables.   
Results  
Lactate   
A significant  increase  (P<0.001; d = 4.8; r = .92) was found  in blood  lactate , post- 8 x100m  
test, compared  to baseline  blood  lactate  (8.81 mmol-1 ± 2.09 vs 1.55 mmol-1 ± 0.42) . Blood 
glucose  levels  also increased  from  5.01 mmol-1 ± 0.91 pre-test to 7.12 mmol-1 ± 1.22 post-
test (P<0.001 ; d = 1.96;  r = .7)(Table  1), confirming  the high intensity  nature  of the training  
session  (Pyne  et al., 2001 ; Aujouannet  et al., 2006 ; Anderson  et al., 2006 ; Anderson  et al., 
2008 ; Carr et al., 2011;  Figueiredo et al ., 2012).  
 
Time,  Heart  rate and stroke  length  
Swimmers  were  asked  to maintain  swim  pace at a level  equivalent  to 85% of their best 100m  
time. No significant  difference  was found  in swimming  times  during  the test (P=0.19)  
demonstrating  that swimmers  maintained  an even  pace throughout.  A significant  increase  in 
 
9 heart  rate was observed  between  the first (167 ± 17 BPM)  and final (199 ± 21 BPM)  
repetitions  of the 8 x100m  training  set (P<0.001 ; d = 1.67;  r = .64). (Table  2) 
A significant  reduction  in left arm stroke  length  (P<0.00 1; d = 1.26;  r = .53) and right  arm 
stroke  length  (P<0.0 01; d = 1.14;  r = .5) was recorded  during  the test, from  1.36m (±0.1 4m) 
left and 1.37m  (±0.14m)  right  on the first swim  to 1.22m (±0.07m)  left and 1.24m (±0.0 8m) 
right  on the final swim.  (Table  3) (Figure  2.) 
Joint  reposition  sense  
A significant  increase  in mean  joint reposition  variance  (as defined  by the magnitude  of 
error  from  the 45° reposition  target  angle)  was observed  following  fatigue  on the right  arm 
from  4.92°  ± 4.71 pre to 9.62°±  6.63 post (P=0.03 ; Cohen’ s d = .82; r = .38), representing  a 
95.31%  increase  in variance.  No significant  differences  were  observed  on the left arm. 
(Table  4). 
No significant  correlation  between  joint position  sense  and stoke  length  was found  pre- or 
post- fatigue.    
 
Range  of motion  
Range  of motion  into external  rotation  was also significantly  reduced  in both right (-5.29° ; 
P<0.001 ; d = .75; r = .35) and left arms  (-3.18° ; P=0.04 ; d = .42; r = .2) post fatigue . (Table  
3). No significant  differences  were  observed  for internal  rotation.  
No significant  correlation  between  external  rotation  range  and stoke  length  was found  pre- 
or post- fatigue.   
Strength  
No significant  strength  differences  were  observed  pre- to post-fatigue  in either  the internal  or 
external  rotators  of either  shoulder.    
 
10 There  was, however,  a statistically  significant  relationship  between  right  external  rotation  
strength  and stroke  length,  pre- (R=-0.635)  and post- (R=-0.643)  fatigue  using  a Pearson  
correlation  coefficient.    
 
Discussion  
Following  8 x 100m  training  swims , off a 2-minute  interval  at 85% of maximum  swim  time, 
several  changes  were  observed.  These  included  a significant  reduction  in stroke  length  in 
both right  (13cm; P<0.001; d = 1.14;  r = .5) and left (14cm; P<0.001 ; d = 1.26;  r = .53), 
arms , reduced  range  of motion  into external  rotation  in both right  (-5.29°;  P<0.0 01; d = .75; 
r = .35) and left arms  (-3.18°;  P=0.04;  d = .42; r = .2), and a 95.3%  increase  in joint 
reposition  variance  on the dominant  right  arm (P=0.03;  Cohen’s  d = .82; r = .38). 
 
Using  Rhea ’s (2004)  interpretation  of effect  sizes  for highly  trained  individuals,  the 
effect  of fatigue  on stroke  length  can be considered  as large;  the reduction  in the 
right  and left arm range  of motion  can be considered  moderate -to-large  and moderate  
respectively;  the increase  in joint reposition  variance  can be considered  moderate.  
The observed  reduction  of stroke  length  under  fatigue  is in contrast  to previous  
findings  (Anjouannet  et al., 2006) , but supports  Figueiredo et al., (2012) who 
observed that the reduction in stroke length accompanied the rise in blood lactate 
during a maximal 200m swim test, with stroke frequency increasing to maintain 
velocity. The contr ast with Anjouannet et al may be due to the relatively low volume 
of their fatiguing protocol (4 x 50m) compared with the volume  and intensity  of this 
particular  swim  training  session  (8 x 100m).  Figueiredo e t al., (2012), also observed  that 
the right arm phase took longer than the left arm phase, associating this with ‘handedness’ of 
the swimmers and suggested that the dominant arm is preferentially  used for propulsion and 
 
11 the non -dominant hand is preferentially  used for control and  support. This may explain our 
findings that the  dominant  arm showed a  greater reduction  in external rotation range of 
motion , compared to the non -dominant , and also a significant reduction in joint position 
sense , that was not observed in the non -dominant. This fatigue in the dominant arm tends to 
agree with previous results suggesting that fatigue affected  joint p osition sense and 
proprioception  (Carpenter et al.,  1998 ; Lee e t al., 2003).  
 
Although there were large  decreases observed in some individuals, f atigue , however,  had no 
significant  effect on  maximal  isometric stren gth in both internal  and external rotation in 
either arm  Despite  this, we still observed  a significant  strong  correlation  between  external  
rotation  strength  and stroke  length,  both pre- and post- fatigue.  This may reflect  the fact that 
there  was a general  (but non-specific)  trend  towards  reduced  strength  with fatigue.  This may 
be related to  the muscle endurance cap abilities of swimmers  who re gularly undergo 
endurance based swimming  training  (Kluemper  et al., 2006;  Lynch  et al., 2010;  Sein et al., 
2010;  Allegrucci  et al., 1995) , with isometric strength , as assessed in this study , not directly 
affected in the same way that joint position sense and range are . It is unlikely  that, due to the 
repetitive  nature  of the sport , swimmers  ever produce  a maximal  internal  rotation  
contraction  when  swimming . It is possible  that a muscle  strength  or local  muscular  
endurance  test that focuses  on multiple  repetitions  may produce  different  results  with 
endurance  trained  athletes , with previous  research  observ ing significant  reduction  in internal  
and external  rotation  strength  over 50 repetitions  on an isokinetic  dynamometer  (Beach  et 
al., 1992) .  
 
Practical  Recommendations  
These  results,  along  with the clear  link between  training  volume  and impingement  injuries  
(Lynch  et al., 2010 ; Beach  et al., 1992 ; Walker  et al., 2011) , leads  us to question  the wisdom  
 
12 of adolescents  swimming  the high volumes  reported  (Lynch  et al., 2010;  Sein et al., 2010;  
Allegrucci  et al., 1995),  without  first having  an injury  prevention  and strengthening  
programme  focused  on the functional  eccentric  strength  of the external  stabilising  muscles  
of the shoulder.  In each concentric  ‘power  stroke’  the small  stabilising  muscles  must  work  
synergistically  to prevent  the anterior  translation  of the humeral  head.  Continued  fatigue  and 
poor joint position  sense  could  result  in anterior  humeral  head  translation  due to the 
dominance  of overactive  pectoral  minor  and latisimus  dorsi  muscles  leading  to laxity  of the 
weaker  posterior  muscles  (Tate  et al,. 2012) . Anterior  translation  places  the shoulder  in a 
position  whereby  the subacromial  space  is compressed,  potentially  aggravating  tissues  such 
as the subacromial  bursa  and supraspinatus , leading  to the impingement  syndrome  known  as 
‘swimmers  shoulder’ .  Anterio r translation  will also cause  an internal  rotation  of the 
hume rus putting  additional  strain  on the long head  of biceps  tendon .  
 
Given  the significant  reduction  in external  rotation  range  and increased  proprioceptive  
variance  as a result  of fatigue,  along  with the significant  correlation  observed  between  stroke  
length  and strength,  it is possible  that competitive  swimmers  may benefit  from  a shoulder  
external  rotation  strengthening  programme  that includes  inner  range  external  rotation  
activities,  mobility  training  aimed  at restoring  external  rotation  range  of motion , and 
proprioception  training .  It is possible  that such a programme  could  help swimmers  maintain  
stroke  length  and external  rotation  range  after fatiguing  swimming.  This may be relevant  to 
injury  prevention  because  it may help swimmers  offset  the pull from  the dominant  internal  
rotators  and reduce  potential  for impingement  of supraspinatus  tendon  (Kluemper  et al., 
2006).   
 
Conclusion  
 
13  
This investigation  revealed  a reduction  in stroke  length  across  both arms  and also an arm 
bias in swimming  whereby  a greater  reduction  in both external  rotation  range  and joint 
position  sense  was observed  in the dominant  arm when  fatigued.  This has highlighted  a 
relationship  between  fatigue  and potential  mechan ism of shoulder  pathology  in swimmers.  
Competitive  swimmers  may benefit  from  a shoulder  external -rotation  strengthening  
programme  that includes  inner  range  external  rotation  activities,  mobility  training  aimed  at 
restoring  external  rotation  range  of motion , and proprioception  training.   It is possible  that 
such a programme  could  help swimmers  maintain  stroke  length  and external  rotation  range  
after fatiguing  swimming  with benefits  for both performance  and injury  prevention .
