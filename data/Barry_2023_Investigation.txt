 i.Abstract  
Title: An Investigation into the Relationship between Training Load  and Injury and 
Illness in Competitive Swimming . 
Introduction: In competitive swimming , optimal performance relies heavily on 
maximising specific capacities to succeed  in competiti on. The training demands  for this 
optimisation require overreaching interspersed with recovery. Elite coaches rely on their 
previous experience, coupled with wider sports science support  to plan, organise and 
periodise training cycles. However, despite these practices , competitive swimmers often 
train and compete with persistent health problems. Training load monitoring and 
injury/illness surveillance practices are a necessary process  in counteracting training 
load-related  errors a nd designing and implement ing injury/illness prevention strategies.  
Aims: (1) To explore best practice in monitoring training load and injury and illness 
surveillance in competitive swimming environments  and (2) T o investigate the 
relationships between training load and injury and illness in competitive swimmers.  
Methods: Five studies were conducted in this programme of research. Firstly, a 
systematic review explored  the prevalence of training load monitoring practices within 
competitive swimming research . The review also investigated  the relationship between 
training load and pain, injury, and illness within competitive swimming research (Chapte r 
two).  Secondly, an online survey was used to  determine the current applied training load 
monitoring and injury surveillance practices within competitive swimming environments 
(Chapters three and four).  Subsequently, an integrated training load monitoring  and 
injury/illness surveillance system for use within competitive swimming environments  
was designed, implemented, and reported, while a qualitative end -user evaluation process 
was additionally executed (Chapter five).  Finally, a prospective, longitudinal  data 
collection was conducted using the integrated training load and injury/illness surveillance 
system. The resulting data wer e analysed t o explore the relationship between training load 
and aggregates of training load and injury and illness in competitive swimmers  (Chapter 
six).  
Results:  The systematic review identified  no clear evidence of an association between 
training load and pain, while there may be some evidence to suggest a relationship 
between training load and injury and illness.  An international survey of training load 
monitoring practices found that 83.9% of those surveyed employed some element of 
ii 
 training load monitoring . Both internal and external training load monitoring were used 
in 80.8% of those case s, with s wim volume (mileage) (96 .2%) and session rate of 
perceived exertion (sRPE) (92 .3%) most frequently use d. Thematic analysis highlighted 
that “stakeholder engagement”, “resource constraints” or “functionality and usability of 
the systems” were shared barriers to the training load monitoring  process . An 
international survey of injury surveillance practices found that 68.1% of practitioners  
participated in injury surveillance . A recognised definition for injury was used in 86.6%  
of those cases . Injury surveillanc e was identified as  very effective at identifying injury 
trends  by 66.6% of those surveyed , while previous injury history and training load data 
were perceived to be influential in preventing injury. Athlete adherence to training load 
monitoring was impacted  by “ process constraints ” and “data access and control ”. 
Practitioners  highlighted communication and cooperation amongst stakeholders , 
layering context to the data, maintaining data integrity  and the coach’s influence in the 
monitoring process  as being important to the monitoring/surveillance process.  
Prospective training load and injury/illness monitoring highlighted that the average 
weekly volume was 33.5 ± 12.9 km. The weekly total training load (AU) averaged 3,838 
± 1,616.1 AU, with 85% of that  load coming from swimming.  A total of 60 medical 
attention illnesses  and 58 medical attention injuries were recorded  during the observation 
period.  Statistical analyses  found no association between Weekly Pool Volume (km), 4 -
week Rolling Pool Volume (km),  Weekly Total Load Training (AU) and 4 -week Rolling 
Total Training Load (AU)  and ACWR and medical attention injury and illness. This 
occurred irrespective of a 0 -day or 7 -day lag time.   
Conclusions: The findings of this programme of research do not support an association 
between training load and medical attention injury and illness  in th e studied  cohort  of 
athletes . Monitoring training load and injury/illness surveillance have their own unique 
challenges which must be navigated during the design and implementation stages. 
Periodic end -user evaluations are necessary to meet the demands of dynamic sporting 
environments. The sRPE method of monitoring training load should be employed in 
practical environments to guide coaches’ periodisation plans and to compare the coaches’ 
planned training volume and intensity against what the athlete is subjectively 
experiencing. sRPE is also beneficial as it can transcend all aspects of a modern -day swim 
programme. Dryland activities, competition and swim training load can be quantifi ed 
utilising the same method, allowing for an accurate measure of total training load .

If Carlsberg did supervisory teams, then I am sure Tom, Karen, Mark and Cormac would 
be top choices. You have gently guided me through the last four years, subtly pushing me 
in the right direction whenever I hit a fork in the road. My understanding of the research 
process has improved greatly because of your guidance. More importantly, I have learned 
massively from each of your management styles, emotional intelligence, and leadership. 
You have always put the researcher first and the research second and  I hope to take the 
best of each of you away with me and apply it to my life and work going forward.   
Swim Ireland has embraced this body of work at each juncture and has supported and 
facilitated its development. I am indebted to Paul Talty and the staf f and athletes at NCD 
for being willing participants and contributors throughout the project.  Importantly, I am 
forever grateful to John, Mikey, Jade , Kathry n, Ronan and Carol  and all the NCL athletes 
who have  been open and eager participants , as well as great friends, supporters , and 
confidants throughout the whole process.  
I am indebted to SJ, Kathryn and Julianne for all their time and effort in designing and 
implementing the injury/illness data collection system. You have guided a crucial aspect 
of this research and without your input, organisation, and direction, the data collection 
process would not have been as efficient and enjoyable.  As practitioners,  I have learned 
significantly from you all  and have loved working with three outstanding people.  
I would like to thank th e Irish Research Council for its financial support throughout this 
process . The employment -based programme allowed me to stay engag ed with my role as 
an S&C while developing my skills as a researcher.  
I started this adventure with Pat, Aidan and Tim and am delighted to be finishing with 
you. I want to thank you and all the past and present crew in PG034. We may have lost a 
few years there in the middle, but it has been great to be able to share this journey with 
you all.  
I need to include everyone that has lived and visited  ConsCotts  in the past four years ! It 
has been a hub of enjoyment and a steadfast in my life. The PhD process, particularly 
during COVID was made ea sier knowing we had the cottage  as a base. It was its  own 
ecosystem of fun, friends and family.  
It is hard to believe that since starting the PhD, two new arrivals have joined the family. 
I want to thank Mam, Dad, Mike, Maeve, Claire, Nicko a nd Aisling for being there 
through the good and the bad. You have always been an amazing source of support and 
have embraced all my choices. You have been my biggest cheerleaders. I promise, no 
more college ….for a while!  
Interestingly, ULBohs get a mention in a swimming research project. I woul d like to thank 
the Dream Team and players who have become a large part of my life (again!) this past 
year. You have been a welcome support and distraction when needed and provided plenty 
of laughs and liquid inspiration. I am looking forward to next seaso n already.

workloads (Bourdon et al., 2017) . 
Fatigue  Fatigue can be defined as muscular when an athlete is 
unable to maintain the required muscle contraction or 
performed workload. It can also encompass extreme 
tiredness after exertion. It can be subcategorised as 
peripheral or central in the nervous system (Phillips 2015) . 
Illness  A complaint or disorder, experienced by an athlete, not 
related to injury. Illnesses include health related problems

training but without time -loss (Langhout et al., 2019) . 
Prevalence  The proportion of athletes affected  by a specific condition 
at a defined time ( point prevalence) or time period (eg, 
12-month prevalence, life -time prevalence), and is

or system  as the index injury/illness (Hamilton et al., 
2011).  
Time Loss  A health problem which leads to the athlete being unable 
to take full part in FINA activities. If the athlete misses the 
rest of the training or competition session but returns for 
the next training/competition, this should be recorded as a

 1.1 Background  
The  Fédéra tion Internationale de Natation (FINA)  was established in 1908 and has global 
management over the development of aquatic disciplines including  swimming, water 
polo, diving, artistic swimming and open water swimming (‘About FINA’ 2021) .  In 
2022, FINA was rebranded as World Aquatics, however for consistency, throughout this 
thesis World Aquatics will be referred to as FINA. Swimming has a long history as an 
Olympic sport, dating back to the 1896 Games in Athens (Hill et al., 2021) , and has four 
distinct strokes; front crawl ( metonymically referred to as freestyle) , backstroke, 
breaststroke and butterfly . Within global competi tions, swimming take s place in either a 
25-meter pool (short course) or 50 -meter pool (long course); however , only the 50 -meter 
format is used at the Olympic Games. At  the most recent 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games, a 
total of 35 swimming finals were held (the high est in Olympic history), with 21 countries 
represented on the medal table (FINA Annual Review  2021) . This highlights the global 
impact of the sport of swimming and the level of competitiveness at the upper echelons 
of the sport.  To perform at the elite level, exceptional physical demands are placed on 
the athlete . Elements of power, speed and endurance are all required to reach optimal 
performance (Pyne and Sharp 2014) .  Swimming performance , at the fundamental level , 
is related to the optimal balance between a swimmers’ propulsive force capabilities and 
their ability to overcome drag or water resistance (Pendergast et al., 2005) . More 
holistically, elite performance requires that the training demands be periodised 
throughout training cycles and ultimat ely optimised during peak competition periods  
(Hellard et al., 2019) .  
Monitoring training load is a critical aspect of planning and periodising training demands  
(Foster et al., 2001) . To improve insight into the training load of an athlete, key me trics 
need to be monitored and understood. Training load can be divided into external and 
internal load (Bourdon et al., 2017) . External training load refers to the work completed 
by the athlete (Halson 2014)  and is frequently used bec ause of its ease of quantification 
(Paquette et al., 2020) . External training load is measured independently of the internal 
training load (Halson 2014)  and may include metrics such as distance, speed and time. 
Internal training load is the measurement of the athletes’ relative biological (physiological 
and psychological) stress and may include measures such as hear t rate, rate of perceived 
exertion (RPE) and oxygen consumption (Bourdon et al., 2017) . Typically, internal 
training load has been seen as  more challenging to monitor (Paquette et al., 2020) , 
however , best practice advocates for an integrated approach where both internal and 
3 
 external training loads are monitored to provi de optimal insight into the athlete’s load 
related stress (Bourdon et al., 2017) . The session rate of perceived exertion method 
(sRPE) is one such method of mo nitoring internal training load that has been widely used 
in team sports (Gabbett 2016)  because of its ease of use and interpretation (Fusco et al., 
2020) . The amalgamation of internal and external training can be calculated to monitor 
the total training load (sRPE -TL) of a session by multiplying the athlete’s sRPE (internal 
load) by the session duration in minutes (external load). Since its conception, the 
application of sRPE -TL to quantify training load has been used in a large number of 
studies (Askow et al., 2021) . A systematic review completed in 2016 investigated the 
relationship between training load , injury, illness and soreness (Drew and Finch 2016) . 
The review included 35 papers from a range of sports. The findings showed that sRPE -
TL was the most frequently (n=25) used method of monitoring training load with in team 
sports. The sport of swimming was represented i n only one  (Hellard et al., 2015)  of the 
35 papers. Furthermore , Hellard et al., (2015) did not utilise the sRPE method , leaving 
the relationship between training load , injury, illness,  and soreness in swimming unclear .   
The relationship between sRPE based training load and injury and illness has been 
investigated using both absolute and relative measures. Absolute measures encompass 
the sum of all or one category of training load and presented over a set duration e.g. 
weekly pool load, total  weekly  load (Drew and Finch 2016) . Relative load expresses the 
change in training load (percentage, ratio) in proportion to another  (Drew and Finch 
2016) , e.g., acute to chronic workload ratio (ACWR).  sRPE has been seen as the most 
commonly used measure of training load in the literature (Eckard et al., 2018) , with both 
absolute and relative loads being linked  with in jury and illness  (Drew and Finch 2016) . 
Acute increases in absolute load have been associated with increased risk of injury with 
absolute changes in week to week  training load (1069AU) increasing the risk of injury 
by 60% in the subsequent week  in a Rugby Union population (Cross et al., 2016) . 
Similarly, accumulated loads  over a number of weeks has also been shown to increase 
injury risk  in professional soccer players  (Jaspers et al., 2018) .  Previous research has 
noted that the use  of a exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) ACWR is the 
more sensitive measure of relative training load when compared with the more traditional 
rolling average (Griffin et al., 2020a) . Research has shown that ACWR has been related  
to an increased risk of injury  (Griffin 2021) . However, the majority of the research  
examining the relationship b etween EWMA ACWR,  and injury has also been conducted 
4 
 in team o r field-based  sports with a noticeable gap with regards endurance sports or 
competitive swimming.  
Competitive swimmers typically train with large training demands including high training 
distances and session frequencies (Pollock et al., 2019) , potentially resulting in fatigue 
related illness (Johnson 2003) , repetitive strain and micro -trauma  (Gaunt and  Maffulli 
2012) . Individual athlete characteristics such as age have been highlighted as moderators 
for both injury and illness risk in aquatic sports (Prien et al., 2017) . This elevated risk of 
injury and illness (Pollock et al., 2019)  heighten s the nee d for individualised training load 
management alongside adequate recovery strategies (Collette et al., 2018) . 
The injury profile of competitive swimmers has been well established, with the most 
recent review of epidemiology of swimming injuries published in 2021 (Trinidad et al., 
2021) . This review highlighted the main location of  injuries in swimmers are shoulder, 
back and knee with muscle overuse and tendon injuries being the most common .  Injury 
inciden ce rates of 2.6 -3.0 injuries per 1000 hours of exposure or 3.2 -6.1 per 100 registered 
athletes have been reported (Trinidad et al., 2021) . However , the review concluded that 
there is no consensus on reporting injury rates in swimming studies. They summarised 
that the incidence rate was highly variable which is often due to methodological 
inconsistencies between study design and reporting (Trinidad et al., 2021) . The authors 
concluded that future studies should follow consensus guideline recommendations i n 
terms of data collection and injury surveillance in swimming. Additionally, they 
recommended that swimming literature should focus more broadly on all injuries as 
opposed to a narrow focus on shoulder injuries which has been significantly more 
researched  than less prevalent  injuries.  
A competitive swimmer’s illness profile  is also critically important  but has been less well 
established than their injury pro file. Swimmers have been shown to train and compete 
with persistent health problems (Prien et al., 2017)  which has been show n to negatively  
impact performance (Pyne 2005) . Studies have highlighted that sig nificant immune 
deficiencies are not commonplace  in competitive swimmers  (Hellard et al., 2015) . 
However, minor deteriorations in health  related to intensive perio ds of training can lead 
to minor illness such as upper respiratory tract infections (URTI) (Hellard et al., 2015) . 
It has b een found that URTI are not more common in swimmers than the general 
population,  but the infection has a greater impact on training and symptoms can be 
exacerbated by chlorine  inhalation  (Johnson 2003) . After a two-year observational study, 
5 
 Hella rd et al., (2011) also concluded  that URTI infections were the most  common 
condition in elite international and national swimmers . The intensive training periods and 
winter months were deemed the highest risk for infection, with national swimmers at a 
higher risk of  illness when compared to their international peers (Hellard et al., 2011) . 
Despite a relationship between URTI and training load,  swimming level  and seasons  
being established  within this study, further research is needed to provide conclusive 
evidence into the associations with all pathologies affecting competitive swimmers.  
FINA published an injury and illness surveillance consensus statement in 2016 to provide 
direction on injury and illness surveillance methods (Mountjoy et al., 2016) . The 
consensus statement outlined specific definitions of injury and illness, with improved 
clarity on classification systems and exposure reporting. The statement concluded that 
consensus guidelines should direct future prospective in -competition and out -of-
competition injury and illness surveillance. It also recommended that future research 
should assess or monitor potential risk factors in parallel with injury and illness 
surveillance. Th is practice would inform future preventative intervention strategies 
(Mountjoy et al., 2016) . More recently, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) also 
published a consensus statement for recording and reporting of injury and illness 
surveillance dat a (Bahr et al., 2020) . The aim was to provide practical guidance on sports 
generic da ta collection and reporting protocols, with the ultimate goal of the consensus 
statement to be  used in tandem with sport specific statements to encourage greater 
consistency in injury and illness surveillance projects (Bahr et al., 2020) . The IOC 
consensus statement also echoed the recommendations by FINA on supplementing injury 
and illness surveillance data with additional relevant metrics (demographics, health data, 
performance and training level) which may inform related risk factors and allow better 
comparison of findings (Bahr et al., 2020) . According to Trinidad et al., (2021), since the 
consensus statement publication in 2016, t he implementation  of the methodological 
recommendations for data collection has not been observed .  
Since 2016, two in -season prospective surveillance studies have been published 
(Matsuura et al., 2019; Boltz et al., 2021) . Both studies, while robust in design, have 
significant limitations in the reporting of the results. Matsuura et al., (2019) calculated 
incidence rates as the number of events per competing athlete and per 100 athletes by 
body part over the course of the whole study period. Boltz et al., (2021) did not calculate 
incidence rates but instead opted for the rate per 1000 athl ete exposures (AE). An AE in 
this case was one athlete participating in one exposure event; however, the authors 
6 
 acknowledge estimating AE based on roster size rendering  it less accurate (Boltz et al., 
2021) . In both studies, the surveillance procedures were robust, but the data presented 
lacked practical application based on their exposure or incidence rate reporting. Both 
studies provide recommendations, which include more detailed athlete exp osure data 
(type or intensity of training, distance sw am, and cardiovascular/exertional indices) in 
parallel with their surveillance procedures (Matsuura et al., 2019; Boltz et al., 2021) . The 
use of a common training load metric such as swim volume (km) or sRPE -TL in parallel 
with injury/illness surveillance could be a potential solution  to improving the incidence 
rate or exposure reporting in competitive swimming.  
Load management is a risk factor that is considered to be a major element in the incidence 
of injury (Soligard et al., 2016)  and is potentially a factor in the incidence of illness 
(Schwellnus et al., 2016) . However, training load prescription in swimming has 
historically been planned through a coach’s experience and intuition (Wallace et al., 
2008)  and is heavily reliant on monit oring the volume of training in either meters, 
kilometres, minutes or hours (Feijen, Tate, Kuppens, Barry , et al.  2020) . Research has 
shown a swimmer’s compliance to adhering to the prescribed training distance is 
considered good; however, they are less effective in adhering to planned intensity 
(Stewart and Hopkins 1997) . Heart rate is a measure of internal training load frequently 
employed in swimming (Feijen, Tate, Kuppens, Barry, et al.  2020) , but it has several 
limitations including logistical issues with in an aquatic environment, accuracy in 
evaluating high -intensity interval training and use in the dryland environment  (Wallace 
et al., 2008) .  This highlights a need for training load monitoring in competitive 
swimming to prescribe and monitor both volum e and intensity in a practical way. sRPE 
has been found to be ecologically valid in a swimming environment and can provide a 
practical, non -invasive method for quantifying internal training load in swimming 
(Wallace et al., 2009) . To date, the use of sRPE , sRPE -TL or its aggregates  in swimming 
research  seems to be limited . Collette et al., (2018) explored the use of training load, 
derived through sRPE and its influence on the recovery -stress state of highly trained 
swimmers. This study recommended the use of sRPE -TL in a swimming population 
(Collette et al., 2018) . Similarly, sRPE -TL was used to investigate the relationship 
between training load and saliva biomarkers in Paralympic swimmers by Sinnott -
O’Connor et al., (2018). The study found that salivary IgA, alpha amylase and cortisol 
responded to changes in training load (Sinnott -O’Connor et al., 2018) . Despite being 
prospective in nature, both studies had low sample sizes (<10 participants) and did not 
7 
 directly measure the incidence of injury or illness. A prospective cohort study which 
incorporated sRPE -TL and injury surveillance was published in 2019  (Tomar and Allen 
2019) . The study found no significant relationship between training load and injury. 
However, the study duration was short (7  weeks ), and a very low injury incidence was 
recorded (n=3). The population included was also d escribed as  competitive but the 
training demands were deeme d to be low for a typical competitive swimming population 
(Tomar and Allen 2019) . To satisfy the gaps in the research, future studies  should be 
prospective in nature, with larger and better -defined  sample sizes. Research should also 
meet the recommendations set out by the IOC/FINA injury/illness surveillance consensus 
statements. The combined use of both an internal and external training load measure s is 
advised , with the use of sRPE -TL warranting further investigation. A more global 
investigation should also occur with injury surveillance broadening the scope past 
shoulder injuries . Expanding the study design to include i llness surveillance is important, 
and subsequently recording  more pathologies beside URTI  is advised .  
This programme of research strives to explore the highli ghted gaps in previous research 
related to training load monitoring and injury/illness surveillance in competitive 
swimming. This research will examine the landscape of monitoring practices in both the 
academic and ap plied settings. It will design a traini ng load monitoring system which is 
grounded in both internal and external load measures and utilise the sRPE -TL method. 
The training load monitoring system will be designed in conjunction with consensus 
guidelines and best practice. The injury surveillance  aspect of the system will  globally 
capture all injuries sustained, having a wider focus outside of shoulder injuries. The 
illness surveillance aspect of the system will provide further detail on the illness profile 
in competitive swimmers  and capture a wi de array of pathologies . Both the injury and 
illness surveillance system will be built on the recommendations of the FINA and IOC 
consensus guidelines to improve methodological consistency in the research presented. 
Subsequently, a prospective longitudinal  data collection of pre -defined key training load 
metrics will take place allowing for an investigation into the relationship between training 
load and injury/illness incidences in a competitive swimming environment.

1.4 Thesis Structure  
This programme of research consists of seven  chapters.  
Chapter one introduces  the research thesis and the key concepts involved in this 
programme of research.  It highlights current gaps in the literature and presents a cl ear 
rationale and recommendations for future research. It also defines  the research aims and 
objectives  and provides  a link between the present research gaps and the goals of this 
programme of research.  
Chapter two presents a systematic literature review examining t he relationship between 
training load and pain, injury and illness in competitive swimming (Barry et al., 2021) . 
The review explores important variables associated with training load monitoring in the 
sport and outlines the relationships with pain, injury, and i llness. Methodological 
inconsistencies are highlighted within the research  including highly variable operational 
definitions for pain, injury,  and illness across studies. Study designs are often 
retrospective and cross sectional with low study quality. Trai ning load measures across 
studies are also conflicting. These methodological inconsistencies ma ke inter -study 
comparisons difficult and render any investigation into the relationship between training 
load and pain, injury,  or illness impractic al. The revie w provide s practical 
9 
 recommendations for future research, including the need to conduct longitudinal 
prospective  studies, employing training load monitoring based on the sRPE method.  
Chapter three examines the training load monitoring practices employed by  practitioners 
working within competitive swimming (Barry et al., 2022a) . This research, conducted 
using an international survey, identifies the training load monitoring practices within the 
applied setting and presents the data collection and analysis approaches employed . It also 
details spe cific barriers and facilitators exp erienced , which include stakeholder 
engagement, resource constraints and the functionality and usability of the system.  The 
findings of this chapter outline that large variability in monitoring training load is highly 
specific to the research environment as found in Chapter two . Chapter three shows that  
the applied environment is much more consistent  in the training load monitoring practice s 
employed. Chapter s two and Chapter three provides a solid basis for the design and 
implementation of the training load monitoring system outlined in Chapter five.  
Chapter four identifies and details the injury surveillance practices being used by 
practitioners in competitive swimmin g environment (Barry et al., 2022b) .  This chapter 
explores the nature of injury surveillance in competitive swimming environments and 
highlights the data collected, injury definitions used,  and the practitioners’ perceived 
effectiveness of the injury surveillance practices. Thematic analys is is also used to 
analyse and present the barriers associated with injury surveillance within this population.  
Barriers included; poor communication and a lack of engagement within the injury 
surveillance processes.  The findings of this chapter, combined with Chapter two provide 
strong evidence for the design and implementation of the injury surveillance aspect of the 
integrated system described in Chapter five.  
Chapter five presents the design, implementation and evaluation of a n integrated training 
load injury/illness surveillance system to be used within competitive swimming  (Barry et 
al., 2023) . This chapter builds on the previous gathered research to design an integrated 
training load monitoring platform to be used in parallel with injury/illness surveillance. 
The chapter also outlines the auditing process to safeguard an accurate implementation 
strategy and an extensive qualitative stakeholder evaluation of the system.  
Chapter six explor es the relationship between training load and injury and illness in 
competitive swimmers  building on previous chapter recommendations. Utilising the 
system described in Chapter five, training load monitoring using sRPE derived metrics 
was carried out across t wo seasons. In addition, injury/illness surveillance, conducted in 
10 
 line with the most recent consensus statements, was also c arried out  in parallel with the 
training load data. The relationship between the training load data, and its aggregate 
measures, an d the incidence of medical attention injury and illness is explored. The results 
presented medical attention injury and illness epidemiological data for the cohort. The 
findings highlighted a lack of association between  key training load variables , injury,  and 
illness.  
Chapter seven provides a comprehensive discussion of the overall findings. It also 
presents the conclusions  of the programme of research , the most significant limitations 
that were identified, recommendations fo r future research and outlines practical 
suggestions on how best to implement the findings of this research into an applied 
competitive swimming environment .

 2.1 Abstract  
Introduction:  Research suggests that the frequency of training, combined with the 
repetitive motion involved in high volume swimmi ng can predispose swimmers to 
symptoms of over -training. The prevention of pain, injury and illness is of paramount 
importance in competitive swimming to maximise a swimmer’s ability to train and 
perform consistently. A significant factor in the prevention  of pain, injury and illness is 
the appropriate load monitoring and management practices within a training programme.  
Aims:  The aim of this systematic review is to investigate the relationship between 
training load and pain, injury,  or illness in competiti ve swimmers.  
Methods:  The databases SPORTDiscus, CINAHL, Scopus, MEDLINE and Embase 
were searched in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Studies were included if they 
reported on competitive swimmers and statistically analysed the link between training 
load and either pain, injury,  or illness. The methodological quality and study bias was 
assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute  (JBI)  Critical Appraisal Checklist.   
Results:  The search retrieved 1,959 articles, 15 of which were included for review. The 
critical appraisal process indicated study quality was poor overall. Pain was the most 
explored condition (N=12), with injury (N=2) and illness (N=1) making up the remaining 
articles. There was no evidence of an association between training load and pain, wh ile 
there may be some evidence to suggest a relationship between training load and injury 
and illness.   
Conclusions:  The relationship between training load and pain, injury and illness is 
unclear owing to a host of methodological constraints. The review highlighted that youth, 
master s, and competitive swimmers of a lower ability ( e.g., club versus international) may 
need  consideration  when planning training loads. Winter periods, higher intensity 
sessions and speed elements may also need to be programmed with care. Monitoring 
practices need to be developed in conjunction with consensus guidelines, with the 
inclusion of in ternal training loads being a priority.  Future research should focus on 
longitudinal prospective studies, utilising the sRPE monitoring method and investigating 
the applicability o f ACWR  (EWMA ).  Improved methods and study design will provide 
further clar ity on the relationship between load and pain, injury, and illness.

 2.2 Background  
Aquatic sports were one of the original sports in the modern Olympic Games, and have 
since grown to have the second highest athlete participation, with 900 competitive 
swimmers participating at the 2016 Rio Olympic Games (‘Rio 2016 - swimming | 
FINA.org - official FINA website’ 2020) . In competitive swimmers, injury prevalence 
ranges from 32.2% to 74.6%, with the shoulder accounting for a large proportion of 
injuries, followed by knee and lower back injuries (Toomey et al., 2018) . The incidence 
of overuse injuries (1.48) surpass that of acute injuries (1.10), when adjusted per 1000 
exposure hours in competitive swimmers (Ristolainen et al., 2009) . Despite 81% of 
Olympic swimming events being contested in under two minutes and  twenty seconds, the 
traditional training practices of competitive swimmers are high in volume (Nugent et al., 
2019) . The extensive nature of trai ning means there is a significantly higher incidence of 
injury in training than in competition (Soligard et al., 2017) . An abundance of research 
suggests that the high frequency of training (Weldon and Richardson 2001) , as well as 
the repetitive motion (Pink and Tibone 2000)  can predispose swimmers to symptoms of 
overtraining (Khodaee et al., 2016) . Overtraining is de fined as the accumulation of 
training or non -training stress resulting in a long term decrement in performance capacity 
(Lehmann et al., 1999) . Overtraining can often have related physiological signs and 
symptoms of prolonged maladaptation (Meeusen et al., 2006) , leading to disturbances  in 
the endocrine,  immune,  musculoskeletal  and neurologic  systems  (Myrick 2015) .  
Prevention of pain, injury and illness is of paramount importance within elite sport, not 
only to safeguard the long -term health of the athlete, but to maximise their ability to train 
and perform without interruptio n (Palmer -Green et al., 2013) . Finding a balance between 
training load and recovery is crucial in the prevention of overtraining (Kenttä and 
Hassmén 1998) . To this end, the dose -response relationship needs to be monitored. While 
the response aspect of this paradigm is more easily measured, the dose imposes more 
logistical cha llenges (Lambert and Borresen 2010) . The incidence of injury in swimming 
is seen as being low in comparison to other sports, but the prevalence of overuse injuries 
is high (Matsuura et al., 2019) . This further emphasises the importance of load monitoring 
among elite swimmers (Pollock et al., 2019) , and also quantification of the training load 
in order to identify the effects of traini ng (Mujika 2017) . Training load can be divided 
into internal and external loads, with external loads describing the quantification of work 
and internal loads describing the response to that work (Drew and Finch 2016) . In 
swimming, distance, time or speed are habitually used to monitor the external training 
14 
 load, with heart rate typically used to monitor internal training load (García -Ramos et al., 
2015) . A range of other methods such as self -administered questionnaires, sport -specific 
performance test and blood screening have been used as methods to reduce the risk of 
overtraining (Pollock et al., 2019) .  
The links between various measures of training load and either pain, injury and illness 
has been examined across a variety of sports (Jones et al., 2017; Eckard et al., 2018; 
Johnston et al., 2019) . While training load, pain, injury and illness have become key terms 
within sport s cience, a lack of consistency in their definitions has also arisen (Jones et al., 
2017) . The rise to prominence of training load monitoring (Newton et al., 2019)  and 
injury surveillance (Palmer -Green et al., 2013)  practices over the past decade has seen a 
subsequent increase in the n eed for consensus statements. Sports such as cricket, football, 
rugby union, rugby league, tennis, athletics and horse racing have all published 
epidemiological consensus statements in recent years (Bahr et al., 2020) . Many of these 
statements attempt to improve consistency in reporting guidelines to enable the 
comparison of methodologies and  findings. A consensus statement from Fédération 
Internationale de Natation (FINA) in 2016 (Mountjoy et al., 2016) , provided clarity on 
the reporting of injuries and illness in aquatic sports, but did not  address the monitoring 
of training load within the sport and its links with injury surveillance. In the same year, 
Drew and Finch  (2016)  published a systematic review investigating the relationship 
between training load, and injury, illness and soreness in a broad range of sports. The 
review categorised in jury and illness into medical attention and time loss definitions, 
while it also expanded into the area of overuse injuries. The term soreness in this review 
was identified as the prevalence of symptoms irrespective of medical attention or time 
loss. Inclu ding this term broadened the reviews focus to papers that may incorporate 
‘athlete’s self -reported injury’ (soreness or pain) as recommended by the Injury 
Definitions Concept Framework (Timpka et al., 2015; Drew and Finch , 2016) . The 
review concluded that there is moderate evidence of a relationship between training and 
competition load and the incidence of injury, illness and soreness. Their findings 
highlighted that train ing load should be monitored, using sRPE to avoid acute spikes in 
load (Drew and Finch 2016) . This review included 35 studies; however, only one 
swimming paper met the inclusion criteria. More recently, a systematic review completed  
investigated the link between swim training volume and shoulder pain  (Feijen, Tate, 
Kuppens, Claes, et al.  2020)  . The review encompassed 12 studies and highlighted that 
swim training volume was linked  with shoulder pain in adolescent competitive 
15 
 swimmers. While the review provided worthwhile information, several l imitations were 
acknowledged. The review solely focused on measures of external training load ( i.e., 
volume) and limited the scope to shoulder pain. The International Olympic Committee 
(IOC) consensus statements on load in sport and risk of injury (Soligard et al., 2016), and 
risk of illness (Schwellnus et al., 2016)  have stated injury aetiology is multifactorial and 
that load monitoring needs to include a combination of both external and internal loads.  
To date, no  review has completed a comprehensive assessment on the relationship 
between internal and external training load and pain, injury, or illness in competitive 
swimming. This review aims to provide a clear consensus for practitioners working 
within competitiv e swimming on the relationship between training load and pain, injury, 
and illness. Using the most recent guidelines on training load and injury/illness 
surveillance, it is intended to close a gap within the literature in competitive swimming 
as other spor ts have done in recent years. Consequently, the purpose of this systematic 
review is to determine if a relationship exists between training load and pain, injury  and 
illness in competitive swimmers.  
2.3 Methods  
2.3.1 Literature Search  
The search strategy (presented in appendix 2.1) followed the Preferred Reporting Items 
for Systematic Review and Meta -Analysis (PRISMA) Guidelines (PRISMA -P Group et 
al., 2015) . The keyword search string included combinations of the following: Training 
Load, Swimming, Competitive, Injury, Pain, Illness. Each keyw ord was broken into its 
individual Medical Subject Headings (MeSH), terms or synonyms and joined where 
appropriate by Bolan terms “AND”/ “OR”. A copy of the keyword search string is 
provided in the electronic supplementary materi al. Relevant studies were t hen identified 
through running the keyword string through five targeted databases: SPORTDiscus, 
CINAHL, Scopus, MEDLINE and Embase.  
2.3.2 Selection Criteria  
Once the search was conducted, results were filtered for English language within each 
database. No date limits were applied. Remaining results were then stored on a reference 
management tool (Zotero.org) for manual screening. Using the reference management 
tool, duplicates were removed, and titles were initially screened for relevance to the 
subject matter b y a single reviewer (LB). Articles clearly outside the scope of this review 
16 
 were excluded. Titles and abstracts were then screened for the inclusion criteria by two 
reviewers (LB, TC). Articles were segregated into “YES”, “NO”, “MAYBE” folders 
according to  their eligibility.  
The following inclusion criteria had to be present in order for the study to be considered: 
1) the study had to be printed in the English language in a peer -reviewed journal and 
excluded case study, case series, reviews, interventions,  conference proceedings and 
study designs; 2) the method of the study had to clarify that participants were competitive 
swimmers; 3) one or more measures of internal or external training load had to be 
reported; 4) an outcome measure of pain, injury or ill ness had to be reported, which could 
be self -reported or diagnosed by a health professional; and 5) a statistical analysis of the 
difference or association between training load and pain, injury or illness had to be 
reported.   
Full text copies of both the “YES” and “MAYBE” articles were sourced and rescreened 
for inclusion. A comparison of both reviewers’ results was made with a third independent 
reviewer (ML) acting as adjudicator in the event of a disagreement. Once consensus was 
reached, a full search fo r additional papers of the final articles reference lists was carried 
out. Any articles sourced through secondary means ( e.g., reference list search, etc.), were 
screened by both reviewers and included where appropriate. Figure 2-1 presents a flow 
chart diagram of the systematic search process.  
2.3.3 Data Extraction  
Key information pertaining to the inclusion criteria were extracted from each study, using 
a standard data c ollection form. Study design, population characteristics ( i.e., number of 
participants, level of ability, sex, and age), training load measured (internal or external), 
outcome (measure of pain, injury, illness), method of collection for both training load and 
outcome, definition of outcome used, key results or findings were extracted. If any key 
information was not available, the corresponding author was contacted. If no response 
was received after a period of six weeks, the information was deemed unavailab le. 
Findings included those that tested for significant difference ( p-values between groups) 
as well as those that tested for an association (Odds Ratios between exposure and 
outcome). The data extraction table was cross -checked for accuracy by a second re viewer 
(TC). Studies were grouped by outcome for comparison purposes.  
17 
 2.3.4 Training Load Measures  
Internal and external training load measures were defined and extracted based on process 
outlined previously  (Eckard et al., 2018) . Internal training load was defined as the 
athlete’s response to an external stimulus ( e.g., RPE, heart rate (HR), etc.). External 
training load was defined as any external stimulus applied to the athlete independent of 
their athlete characteristics (e.g. distance, time, etc.) (Eckard et al., 2018) . Method  of 
collection was designated as either being self -reported (SR) when the athlete themselves 
recorded the load, or “third party” when the load data was collected and reported by a 
designated person within the coaching or research team.  
2.3.5 Operational Outcome  Definition  
The definition used for pain, injury or illness was extracted and categorised where 
possible according to Mountjoy et al., (2016) and Langhout et al., (2019) . Pain, injury,  
or illness could be categorised as “non -time loss”, “medical attention”  (MA) or “time 
loss”. Medical attention is where a qualified clinician has assessed the athlete’s medical 
condition (Mountjoy et al., 2016) , Time loss  was defined as one which led to the athlete 
being unable to participate in full FINA activities (Mountjoy et al., 2016) , and non-time 
loss was any physical complaint as a result of competition or training but without time -
loss (Langhout et al., 2019) . 
2.3.6 Critical Appraisal  
The Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal Checklists for cohort and cross -
sectional studies were utilised to assess the risk of bias for each individual study as 
relevant to their study design (Joanna Briggs Institute 2019) . Two reviewers (LB, TC) 
individually critically appraised 15 studies (10 cross -sectional, 5 cohorts). Each tool 
included between 8 -11 questions with a focus on the appropriateness of the study design, 
presence of selection bias, validity and reliability of methods, the handli ng of 
confounding factors and appropriateness of the statistical analyses used. Authors assigned 
a “Yes”, “No”, “Unclear” or “Not Applicable” to each question, depending on the 
perceived risk of bias. Study quality was considered poor if they had ≥3 “no” o r “unclear” 
responses as outlined previously  (Nour et al., 2018) . Discrepan cies between the two 
reviewers were resolved through discussion and a third party (CP) was consulted in the 
event an agreement could not be reached.

 2.4 Results  
An online systematic search retrieved 1,959 articles across five databases, 803 of whi ch 
were duplicates. Initial screening of titles and abstracts excluded 996 articles, leaving 160 
full text articles to be assessed. The original database search uncovered 10 articles which 
met the inclusion criteria, with a further 5 articles being include d from secondary sources. 
A total of 15 articles were included for review:  5 cohort and 10 cross -sectional study 
designs. An outcome of pain was the most explored condition (N=12), with injury (N=2) 
and illness (N=1) making up the remainder of the articles . Table 2-2 summarises the 
results.  
2.4.1 Critical Appraisal  
The overall study quality was poor, with ten  of the fifteen studies scoring ≥3 in the “no” 
or “unclear” categories  (Capaci et al., 2002; Krüger et al., 2012; Tate et al., 2012; Walker 
et al., 2012; Harrington et al., 2014; Ristolainen et al., 2014; de Almeida et al., 2015; 
Hellard et al., 2015; Martins et al., 2018; Tomar and Allen , 2019) . Tessaro et al., (2017)  
was the only study to receive a positive appraisal in all eight categories, while Krüger et 
al., (2012) had the most “no” or “unclear” responses. A consistent weakness of all the 
studies was related to mana ging confounding factors. Twelve studies identified 
confounding factors, but only six (Capaci et al., 2002; Tate et al., 2012; Walker et al., 
2012; Harrington et al., 2014; Hellard et al., 2015; Martins et al., 2018)  outlined a strategy 
to manage  them. Strategies included excluding participants who participated in additional 
sports or who had a previous surgery in an area under consideration and may have 
impacted study outcomes . In the cross -sectional studies, all reported sufficient detail 
regard ing the population and setting. The exposure and outcome were measured in a valid 
and reliable way in 27% and 67% of all studies. This highlighted that the method of 
monitoring exposure was a common limitation within the study design, most of which 
relied on self -reported questionnaires. Statistical analyses  were conducted in an 
appropriate manner in 8 6.7% of all studies. Table 2-1 presents  the JBI quality checklist 
information for each of the included studies.  
2.4.2 Participant Demographics  
A total of 1510 swimmers were included in the review with 1 0.5% of them categorised 
as elite (Hidalgo -Lozano et al., 2012; Hidalgo‐Lozano et al., 2013; Hellard et al., 2015; 
Martins et al., 2018) , 35.9% club level (Capaci et al., 2002; Su et al., 2004; Tate et al., 
20 
 2012; Walker et al., 2012; Tessaro et al., 2017; Cejudo et al., 2019) , 23.1% master s level 
(Krüger et al., 2012; Tate et al., 2012) , 3.2% collegiate (Harrington et al., 2014; Tomar 
and Allen 2019)  and 27 .2% national level (Ristolainen et al., 2014; de Almeida et al., 
2015) . The mean age range was 8 -49.5 years, with two studies not reporting age for one 
group, or all of their participants’ demographics (Tate et al., 2012; Tomar and Allen , 
2019) . A variety of descriptors outlining participant’s level of ability, including average 
training distance and hours per week were recorded in the majority of circumstances. 
Large r ange training volumes in kilometres per week (25  - 58 km/week) or hours per 
week ( 4 – 24 hours/week)  were reported. Ten studies reported results from both male and 
female participants, while one study reported solely on male participants (Capaci et al., 
2002)  and two studies on female participants (Tate et al., 2012; Harrington et al., 2014) . 
Two studies did not disclose the gender balance of their participants (Walker et al., 2012; 
Hidalgo‐Lozano et al., 2013) .

 2.4.3 Operational Outcome Definition  
The definition of pain, injury and illness varied amongst the fifteen studies. Of the two 
injury based studies, one of the definitions required a restriction of training (Tomar and 
Allen 2019) , with the second specifically focused on overuse injuries, outlining a 
definition with elements of  time los s and MA criteria (Ristol ainen et al., 2014) . Regarding 
illness, the definition provided was based on Fricker et al., (2005) and required the athlete 
to have received MA and  time loss  away from training. Out of the three categories of 
pain, injury and illness, studies investigating pain used the most diverse definitions. Three 
studies utilised a Numerical Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) (Hidalgo -Lozano et al., 2012; 
Hidalgo‐Lozano  et al., 2013; Tessaro et al., 2017)  with two reporting a set threshold of 
4/10 on the NPRS to denote significant pain (Hidalgo -Lozano et al., 2012; Hidalgo‐
Lozano et al., 2013) . The remaining study did not provide a set threshold on the scale 
(Tessaro et al., 2017) .  Subscales from the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand 
(DASH) questionnaire and the Penn Shoulder Score (PSS) were combined to form the 
Sports and Symptom Survey Form utilised in two of the studies (Tate et al., 2012; 
Harrington et al., 2014) . A set injury definition (McMaster WC et al.  1998)  was used in 
two studies (Walker et al., 2012; Cejudo et al., 2019)  which classified significant 
interfering shoulder p ain (SIP) as a pain that interfered with training or competition, or 
progression in training and caused a cessation or modification of training or racing. A 1 -
5 pain scale was used in one study which indicated if the participant had no pain at level 
1, up to pain preventing competitive swimming at level 5 (Capaci et al., 2002) . A mi xed 
MA/ time loss definition was employed in one study (de Almeida et al., 2015) , which 
referred to the consensus statement of Fuller (2006) . A clinical assessment or screening 
process was conducted in two of the studies (Su et al., 2004; Hidalgo‐Lozano et al., 2013)  
in conjunction with a set definition. Martins et al., (2018)  did not provide a definition of 
pain but highlighted that a questionnaire which evaluated the occurrence of pain was 
administered. Pain was present if the responder answered “yes” to a que stion on the 
presence of pain. Similarly, Krüger et al., (2012)  did not provide a set definition of pain 
but outlined that a retrospective questionnaire was used to determine the incidence of 
shoulder pain over a three -year period.  
2.4.4 Monitoring Training Load  
All the papers included f or review collected external training load, using one or more 
variations. Session duration was the most commonly used unit of load. Nine out of fifteen 
24 
 studies employed this approach and was most often recorded as hours per week. This was 
closely followed by session distance, which was collected in eight studies, most of which 
was recorded as kilometres per week. Finally, session frequency was collected in five 
studies , with practices per week being most frequent. Two out of fifteen studies collected 
intern al training load, with session intensity recorded through the use of sRPE (Tomar 
and Allen 2019)  and blood lactate con centration (Hellard et al., 2015) . The method of 
collecting training load data was reported well in the majority of cases. However, one 
study (Hidalgo -Lozano et al., 2012)  collected training load as hours/week but did not 
report the method of data collection. Another study reported how the internal training 
load (blood lactate profile) was collected, but not the external training load measure 
(meters/week) (Hellard et al., 2015) . Training load data were collected subjectively 
through athlete self -reporting, generally through the use of a questionnaire. A third  party 
was used to submit the data in two instances (Walker et al., 2012; Tessaro et al., 2017) , 
namely the coach, clinician or research assistant.  
2.4.5 Relationship between Training Load and Pain, Injury, and Illness  
Eleven of the fifteen studies stated no statistically significant differences or associations 
between a measurement of training load and the outcome reported (Su et al., 2004; 
Hidalgo -Lozano et al., 2012; Tate et al., 2012; Walker et al., 2012; Hidalgo‐Lozano et 
al., 2013; Harrington et al., 2014; de Almeida et al., 2015; Tessaro et al., 2017; Martins 
et al., 2018; Cejudo et al., 2019; Tomar and Allen , 2019) . In the remaining studies, a 
statistically significant difference was reported between training load and injury 
(Ristolainen et al., 2014)  and pain (Capaci et al., 2002) . A positive association was seen 
between training load and illness (Hellard et al., 2015) , while a negative association was 
reported between training load and pain (Krüger et al., 2012) .  
Two out of twelve studies found a statistical difference or association between training 
load and pain (Capaci et al., 2002; Krüger et al., 2012) . Both studies reported contrasting 
conclusions with Capaci et al., (Capaci et al., 2002)  highlighting that swimmers 
experiencing musculoskeletal pain reported swimming significantly ( p <0.05) more hours 
per week than those without pain (8.86±1.25 vs 8.00±1.06 hours/week). This finding 
contradicted Krüger et al., (2012)  who suggested that those swimming lower  volumes (0 -
4,999 meters/week), were 2.8 times more likely to develop shoulder pain. The remaining 
ten studies that reported on the relationship between training load and pain showed no 
significant difference or association.  
25 
 Two studies investigated the r elationship between training load and injury (Ristola inen et 
al., 2014; Tomar and Allen , 2019) . Ristolainen et al., (2014)  found a positive relationship, 
and reported that the mean number of kilometres swam per year was significantly higher 
in injured swimmers, when compared to non -injured swimmers (1612 km/year vs. 1380 
km/year, p=0.04). The second study reported no signific ant relationship between training 
load (r = -0.35), training monotony (r = 0.62), training strain (r = -0.12) or Acute/Chronic 
Workload Ratio (ACWR) (r = 0.08) and the incidence of injury (Tomar and Allen 2019) . 
The risk of illness (i.e. Upper Respiratory Tract and Pulmonary Infections (URTPI) was 
significantly higher ( p = 0.0244) during high load training periods, while the odds of 
having a URTPI was 70% and 50% higher during intensive training periods than both 
taper and competition periods, respectively (Hellard et al., 2015) . High load workouts at 
maximal speed (blood lactate ≥ 10mmo·L-1) contributed considerably to the increased 
risk (not specified) of URTPI. While the authors highlighted that the risks of URTPI were 
higher for swimmers during the winter months, they also specified that national 
swimmers were generally more at risk than international level swimmers despite 
similarities in age and training prescription. This may be explained by a superior genetic 
resistance response to infection or improved athletic lifestyle management by 
international swimmers, or a lower training load t hreshold by national level swimmers 
(Hellard et al., 2015) .

 2.5 Discussion  
The aim of this systematic review was to investigate the relationship between training 
load and pain, injury, or illness in competitive swimmers. A clear lack of consistency 
within the findings was evident, with conflicting results being presented and many  
methodological limitations preventing accurate comparison of results. This lack of 
consistent reporting prevented a meta -analysis of the results from being conducted. There 
is no clear evidence of a relationship between training load and pain, with the ma jority of 
studies reporting no statistical difference or association between those with pain and their 
exposure to external training loads. This link would require further investigation using 
prospective study designs and coupling of both internal and exte rnal training load to get 
a more accurate representation. There is limited evidence to suggest a relationship 
between training load and injury with one study finding swimming more distance (km) 
in the past year increased the risk of injury (Ristolainen et al., 2014) . This relationship 
would need to be investigated further with both internal and external training loads being 
used to accurately measure training load. There is also limited evidence for the 
relationship between training load and illness based on the work  of Hellard et al., (2015) ; 
however, this needs further rigorous investigation in multiple swimming populations.   
2.5.1 Participant Demographics  
The variability in findings is in keeping with the premise that pain, injury and illness are 
complex and multifactor ial (Wanivenhaus et al., 2012; Schwellnus et al., 2016) , with no 
single variable predicting maladaptation (Soligard et al., 2016) . It is well documented that 
factors including chronological age, tr aining age, injury history and physical capacity can 
impact an athlete’s training response (Gabbett 2 016). Chronological age and training 
experience were two factors which varied greatly within this review. Two studies found 
significant, but contrasting findings between training load and pain in this review (Capaci 
et al., 2002; Krüger et al., 2012) . Capaci et al., (2002) focused on male competitive 
swimmers with a young mean age (14.44 ± 2.4 years) and found swimming more hours 
per week influenced the presence of pain. This contrasts with  Krüger et al., (2012) , who 
solely focused on master s level swimmers (mean age 49.6 ±  12.29 years) and found 
swimming lower volumes per week to be a risk factor for shoulder pain. This may be 
explained by the considerable changes experienced with aging, i.e. loss of muscle mass, 
strength and function, alterations such as  sarcopenia (Volpi et al., 2004) . This age related 
decline also extends to a loss of tendon stiffness, resulting in decreased force transfer 
31 
 capabilities (Reeves et al., 2006) . The rotator cuff is among the most common clinical 
tendon problems for the aging population (McCarthy and Hannafin 2014) , with the risk 
of having a full thickness tear being 2.69 times greater in older adults than adults 10 years 
their junior (Fehringer et al., 2008). Older athletes face an accumulation of residual 
injuries which may limit their training volume and intensity, thus causing a reduction in 
training adaptations (Foster et al., 2007) . This can result in a cyclical pattern of reduced 
ability to train, causing a decreased training load and an increased suscepti bility to 
musculoskeletal injuries. This is supported by Tate et al., (2012) where the master s 
population swam less time per week than any other group within the study. The presence 
of pain at lower volumes may be a by -product of the ‘ injury prevention pa radox’ , where 
higher loads are thought to have a protective effect against injury (Gabbett 2016) . Master s 
athletes, swimming at lower loads, may be more susceptible to injury as they never reach 
the desired threshold of training to provide a protective effect. The reported modifications 
in training volume with age are thought to be as a result of chan ges in stroke 
biomechanics. It has been reported that older swimmers have altered stroke biomechanics 
when compared with elite swimmers. This is understood to be driven by lower values of 
stroke length which may be explained by lower mechanical power and m uscle strength 
(Ferreira et al., 2016) . The master s population, in an effort to reduce the effects of aging 
and to break the cyclical pattern of load related injuries should focus on appropriate 
recovery strategies between ses sions, increased resistance training and complementary 
cross -training sessions (Foster et al., 2007) . 
The level of a swimmer is also deemed to be a contributing factor to their risk of injury. 
Tate et al., (2012) explored the presence of shoulder pain across the lifespan of a 
swimmer. They found that as the competitive level increased, so did the training exposure 
in hours per week, up until 15 -19 years old, after which it dropped off when entering 
master s level swimming. This study found that high school swimmers were most 
symptomatic  and those swimmers with shoulder pain had significantly more swimming 
exposure than those without shoulder pain (1.5±1.14 years, p = 0.01). However, this 
finding was not replicated in acute swimming load (hours/week). Unfortunately, this 
study did not inc lude a collegiate swimming group within the study design, leaving a gap 
between those in high -school and master s level. Typically, it is thought that the collegiate 
swimming population are at increased risk of injury in the first twelve months of joining 
a varsity swim team (Wolf et al., 2009) . This was a key finding by Wolf et al., (2009) 
who reported the highest number of injuries during the first year of eligibili ty, followed 
32 
 by a substantial drop off in the subsequent years. In this study, male and female swimmers 
had a mean number of injuries of 1.21 and 1.19 in their freshman year compared to 0.71 
and 0.46 in their senior year (Wolf et al., 2009) . This is likely due to the transition from 
high-school or club swimming coupled with a sudden increase in training demands, 
followed by acclimatisation in those that do not drop ou t of the sport. Of the two collegiate 
swimming populations included in this review, one was not a true representation of a high 
level varsity programme due to the low loads presented (Tomar and Allen 2019) , while 
the second was a National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I population,  
swimming 18.8 hours/week (Harrington et al., 2014) . Neither study found a statistically 
significant relationship between training load and pain or injury , however, the stage of 
collegiate swimming was not investigated in either study. This could mean that the 
population investigated had become acclimatised to such a training demand or those who 
experience pain or inj ury during the transition from high -school to college do not continue 
to compete at that level (Wolf et al., 2009; Harrington et al., 2014) .   
In an elite population, Hellard et al., (2015) found a higher risk of pathology in national 
level swimmers compared to international level  swimmers. Coaches should consider the 
level of individual swimmers, understanding that swimmers of lower ability may be more 
susceptible than their counterparts. National level swimmers may be of a lower training 
age or capacity , causing a decreased resistance to illness in comparison to their 
international level counterparts (Hellard et al., 2015) . More mature international leve l 
athletes may also manage the training lifestyle demands better than their national level 
peers. Coaches should ensure that the swimmers’ level is considered and modified for 
when planning training loads and session intensity.  
2.5.2 Operational Outcome Definiti on  
It has been clearly reported that inconsistencies in methodological approach and 
definitions can create significant variations in findings (Fuller 2006) . While a number of 
consensus statements have provided clarity in the use of standard terminology, disparities 
in definitions stem from the specific sporting context for which the statements are 
developed (Bahr et al., 2020) . A total of four (Tessaro et al., 2017; Martins et al., 2018; 
Cejudo et al., 2019; Tomar and Allen 2019)  of the included studies were published after 
the release of the 2016 FINA consensus statement with none of them making reference 
to the guidelines and recommendations. A host o f outcome definitions were used amongst 
the 15 studies included in this systematic review, showing large inconsistencies that may 
33 
 be a factor in the conflicting nature of the findings. Many of the definitions reported an 
element of  time loss  from the sport, a restriction in training or the need to have sought 
MA. While the use of this terminology is appropriate and common place in many sports, 
they have limitations when applied to sports such as swimming, where few traditional  
time loss  injuri es occur (Bahr 2009) . As many swimmers tend to train  in the presence of 
pain (Hibberd and Myers 2013) , using a traditional  time loss  injury definiti on may mask 
and under -report the true impact of such pain/injuries (Bahr 2009) . Successful injury and 
illness prevention protocols rely on the correct categorisation of surveillance data 
(Palmer -Green et al., 2013) . The consensus statement from FINA on injury and illness 
reporting publi shed in 2016, provides a clear framework to be implemented in such cases 
(Mountjoy et al., 2016) . Though this consensus statement provides clarity of the use of 
set definitions for injury, illness,  time loss  and MA classifications, it also highlighted the 
need to prospectively monitor symptoms and complaints through the use of The Oslo 
Sports Trauma Research Centre (OSTRC) questionnaire. The OSTRC questionnaire has 
been validated in swimming, and can be implem ented longitudinally to record medical 
conditions that include complaints not leading to absence from the sport (Mountjoy et al., 
2016) .  
While the development of a sport specific consensus statement is a positive step towards 
consistency in reporting, the optimisation of the dissemination procedure and uptake of 
the key principles is a crucial aspect of the process. Even though researchers working 
within a specific related field may be aware of such consensus statements, those working 
at a practical level may have limited knowledge. The utilisation of consensus statements 
can be determined by the perception of relevance within a set period o f time as 
developments of these concepts are rapidly evolving. As consensus statements can take 
12-18 months to develop, the time elapsed between evidence discussion and collation, 
and recommendations published is crucial (Kwong et al., 2016) . Developing , 
disseminating  and assimilating  consensus statements in a timely manner is essential to 
their effectiveness and relevance (Kwong et al., 2016) . Consensus statements might 
benefit from undergoing a “knowledge management” process. Knowle dge management 
is the process of simplifying and improving the creation, sharing and distribution of 
knowledge within a system (Gasik 2011) . A link between those that develop the 
consensus statement,  and the rel evant National Governing Body (NGB) should be formed 
as part of the dissemination process. Providing clear educational strategies to the NGB 
34 
 should be a cornerstone of the dissemination process, allowing the key information to be 
communicated and understoo d at the practitioner level.    
2.5.3 Relationship between  Training Load and Pain  
The relationship between training load and pain was evaluated in twelve of the fifteen 
studies included in this review. A total of two studies found statistically significant 
differences or associations between a measure of training load and pain (Capaci et al., 
2002; Krüger et al., 2012) . A large percentage (60.5%) of competitive male swimmers 
reported musculo skeletal pain through the use of a questionnaire (Capaci et al., 2002) . 
Those who experienced pain spent more time training (training history (years) or training 
hours per week), than those without pain. This suggests that those with a longer training 
history, and who swim more hours per week, have an increased chance of experiencin g 
musculoskeletal pain. This finding challenges the traditional high -volume approach 
which spurs the quantity versus quality debate. Nugent et al., (2017)  discussed this 
concept with expert swimming coaches. Coaches tended to defend the high -volume 
swimming approach, particularly in youth swimming, as it promotes a large aerobic base 
and aids in tec hnical development. However, they clarified that this should transition to 
a quality or more intensity based training system as the swimmer improves (Nugent et 
al., 2017) . This finding is also in contradiction with the theory that training load can have 
a protective effect (Gabbett 2016) ; however, the age of those with pain was relatively 
young (14.78±1.56 years). A swimmer’s ability to acclimatise and develop a robustness 
to higher training thr esholds may be impacted by maturation (Difiori 2002) , and therefore 
training hours should be gradually increased and adjusted for the pubertal development 
of the athlete (Corso 2018) .  
While maturation was not investigated in the current review , and research on the impact 
of maturation on injury is unclear (Bowerman et al., 2014) , coaches should be cognisant 
of the effects of an adolescent growth spurt on their training ability (Corso 2018) . A 
similar youth age category was investigated in four studies (Tate et al., 2012; W alker et 
al., 2012; Tessaro et al., 2017; Cejudo et al., 2019) . All four studies found no statistically 
significant relationship between pain and training load when hours per week, kilometres 
per week or frequency of sessions per week were examined. Su et al., (2004) reported no 
difference in healthy swimmers compared with swimmers with shoulder pain (7.6±5.3 
vs. 8.1±5.1 hours/week, p = 0.80) and (3.3±1.1 vs. 3.0±0.9 km/session, p = 0.33) 
respectively. Swim training distance was not a significant predictor of SIP or significant 
35 
 shoulder injury (SSI) (SIP: OR 1.0, 95% CI  1.0 – 1.0; p = 0.07 / SSI: OR 1.0, 95% CI 1.0 
– 1.0; p =0.11) (Walker et al., 2012) . A similar finding reported no statistically significant 
difference between pain and weekly vol ume ( p =0.309) (Tessaro et al., 2017) . Training 
hours/week showed no difference in those with and without pain across a number of age 
groups (8 -11 years, p =0.18; 12 -14 years, p =0.56; 15 -19 years, p = 0.71; master s, p = 
0.06).  
Where hours per week were monitored, 12 -19 year -old swimmers we re training 
approximately 9 -16 hours per week (Tate et al., 2012) . In youth swimming, training 
capacity needs to be carefully developed as their technical stroke mechanics improve. 
Technical aspects such as changing from unilateral to bilateral breath ing may be 
improving, resulting in an increased risk of shoulder pain as they develop (Tate et al., 
2012) . In populations ranging in age from 18 -30 years old, the training demand typically 
increased, with five studies reporting average training load r anges of 18.8 - 26.8 (±4.8) 
hours per week, or 45 (±20) - 57.1 (±29.9) km/week. No difference was found in any of 
the studies for those with and without pain. These increased training loads suggest that 
the external training load prescribed increases with age, which is in agreement with 
Feijen, Tate, Kuppens, Claes, et al., (2020) . However, the subsequent lack of increased 
pain suggests that  as the athlete ages, their ability to tolerate increased external training 
loads is improved. Another reason may be those athletes that do not experience pain are 
more likely to remain in the sport for longer periods. By tracking external training load 
(km/session or hr/week) alone, these studies may have been unable to quantify the 
individual response to external training load, and thus a major risk factor for 
musculoskeletal pain may not have been detected.  
Krüger et al., (2012) was the only study to fi nd a negative association between training 
load and musculoskeletal pain. While the reported incidence of pain (62.4%) was similar 
to that of Capaci et al. , (2002) , the population and training load measure were different. 
It was found that the volume of tr aining in meters/week was negatively associated with 
shoulder pain, meaning those that swam a lower volume (0 -4,999 meters/week) were 2.8 
times more likely to develop shoulder pain than those that swam a higher volume 
(≥12,000 meters/week). These findings contrasted with the popular opinion that a 
swimmer ’s pain is directly proportional to training volume (Contreras Fernandez et al., 
2012) . While the age of this population could be a significant factor in this finding as 
discussed in section 4.1, there is another possible explanation. This finding could also be 
explained by the injury prevention paradox which highlights that low load can re nder an 
36 
 athlete less prepared and more susceptible to injury (Gabbett 2016) . The concept 
stipulate s that excessively high loads may be inappropriate for individual athletes and can 
increase the risk of injury and illness. However, loads that are not high enough can also 
create an element of fragility within the athletes’ ability to tolerate load and hav e the same 
outcome. This concept reinforces the idea that training loads are not high or low but are 
appropriate or inappropriate for a specific individu al. Coaches need to consider all the 
individual elements when planning appropriate loads to ensure a re duced risk of pain, 
injury and illness (Halson 2014) .  
2.5.4 Relationship between  Training Load and Injury  
The relationship between training load and injury was assessed in two of the included 
studies. The studie s reported contrasting findings with one (Ristolainen et al., 2014)  
presenting the finding that injured swimmers had swum significantly more than non -
injured swimmers in the past 12 months ( p = 0.04). The second study (Tomar and Allen 
2019)  stated that no association between measures of total training load (sRPE), training 
monotony, strain or ACWR and incidence of injury was present. The populations and 
methods studied in both papers varied greatly. While Tomar and Allen (2019)  used a 
common  method of monitoring training load (sRPE), their population was not exposed to 
a rigorous training regime over a duration that is reflective of competitive swimming 
environments. Conversely, the population in Ristolainen et al., (2014) was an elite group 
of swimmers. However, the retrospective study design, coupled with a twelve -month 
recall period, the measurement of external training load and no quantification of internal 
training load means less confidence may be placed on the results.  
2.5.5 Relationship between  Training Load and Illness  
The relationship between training load and illness was investigated in one study meeting 
the required inclusion and exclusion criteria. The study utilised a prospective cohort 
design where training loads and illness was logge d over a four -year period (Hellard et al., 
2015) . The population observed were elite level swimmers, with both internal and 
external training loads being  monitored. Training load was quantified in meters per week 
at each intensity determined by a blood lactate step test detailed by Mujika et al., (1996) . 
Findings showed a positive relationship between training loads and illness with periods 
of high training loads ( OR 1.10, 95% CI 1.01 – 1.19; p = 0.0244) increasing the odds of 
illness by 50 -70%. While t his single study presents limited evidence, it does concur with 
the review of Drew and Finch (2016)  who summated that the relationship between 
37 
 training load and illness was found to be moderate. The review found a positive 
relationship in sports such as sp eed skating, Australian football, soccer and rugby league, 
with no relationship in an elite running population (Drew and Finch 2016) .  
2.5.6 Monitoring Training Load  
The studies included in this systematic review relied heavily on the use of self -reported 
data collected retrospectively through the use of questionnaires. This data is dependent 
on the athlete’s ability to recall and report their individual training data accurately (Black 
et al., 2016) . Previous research has shown that quantifying exercise dosage from data 
collected by questionnaire may be considered as inadequate (Borresen and Lambert 
2006) , particularly with retrospective questionnaires, as the longer the recall period the 
less accurate  the reported estimates (Kjellsson et al., 2014) . The majority of the 
retrospective studies used a twelve -month recall period (Walker et al., 2012; Ristolainen 
et al., 2014; Tessaro et al., 2017) , with one spanning a three -year period (Krüger et al., 
2012) . Previous research has shown a twelve -month recall to be sufficie nt method of 
collecting data (Mukherjee , 2015) . However, in a s tudy comparing retrospective and 
prospective injury surveillance data, perfect agreement between the two methods was 
found when a simple yes or no answer was required. The accuracy of recall was severely 
diminished (approx. 40%) when specific details were required (Gabbe 2003) . This shows 
that the use of self -reported retrospective data for establis hing patterns in sport should be 
avoided when detailed information is needed.  
The relationship between training load and pain was evaluated using external training 
load in all twelve relevant studies. Of the two studies examining the relationship between 
training load and injury, one utilised a measure of external training load, with the second 
study reporting both internal and external training load. Finally, the relationship between 
training load and illness was assessed using both internal and external training load. The 
results showed that session duration (hours/week) was the most widely used external 
training load measure with swimming durations of 4.0 (± 1.7)  - 24 hours/ week and  was 
closely followed by distance per session (km). An external training load such as 
hours/week should be carefully implemented particularly in an advanced training 
environment. Beginner and intermediate athletes can focus on increases in training time 
to good effect; however, once a training programme has plateaued, any furth er increase 
in training hours can become unproductive resulting in session intensity being 
manipulated in order to achieve a training effect (Friel 2018) . Monitoring training 
38 
 distance (km/week) can also cause issues as the swim load measure cannot be 
extrapolated to other cross -training modalities such as resistance training. This leads to 
multiple measures of load being collected but unable to be combined or  aspects of the 
training programme not being monitored at all. Another limitation of the exclusive use of 
external training load methods is that it does not accurately capture the athletes’ individual 
response to the training dose and therefore internal tr aining load needs to be combined 
with external load to provide greater insight to training stress (Bourdon et al., 2017) . The 
use of sRPE has become one of the most commonly used measures of intensity in team 
sports. Session RPE, combined with session duration can provide an integrated train ing 
load measure capturing an athlete’s external load and their individual response to it. An 
additional benefit of this approach is the ability to monitor sRPE globally across a training 
programme such as resistance training and cross training, allowing f or a holistic 
monitoring approach to all aspects of the programme (Williams et al.  2017) .   
All but two (Hellard et al., 2015; Tomar and Allen , 2019)  of the included studies used 
external training load exclusively as a means of quantifying training load. Bourdon et al., 
(2017) summate d that an integrated approach to training load monitoring is important as 
no single marker of an athletes response to load can consistently predict maladaptation 
(Soligard et al., 2016) .  Therefore internal and external load should be monitored in 
combination to pr ovide greater insight (Bourdon et al., 2017) . Tomar and Allen (2019)  
and Hellard et al., (2015) both used a combination of internal and external training load 
in line with current recommendations. Rating of Perceived Exertion was collected as a 
measure of internal training load and was monitored in conjunction with session duration 
by Tomar and Allen  (2019) . The data was analysed to provide measures of training load, 
monotony and strain (Foster , 1998; Foster et al., 2001)  as well as ACWR, as outlined by 
Gabbett et al., (2016) . These training parameters were employed to find the relationship 
with incidence of injury in a university swimming population over a seven -week period. 
No significant relationship was found between training load, strain and monotony or 
ACWR and the incidence of injury in this population, which contradicts earlier studies in 
a variety of sports (Anderson et al., 2003; Gabbett and Jenkins , 2011; Hulin et al., 2014) . 
The lack of significant association could be due to t he observational period being 
relatively short (seven weeks) or the low training load experienced by the group. A 
weekly mean training load of 260±56.33 Arbitrary Units (AU) appears to be relatively 
low, compared to other competitive sporting populations. The mean weekly ACWR was 
0.94±.53 with a peak of 1.03. These ACWR are within acceptable risk ranges according 
39 
 to Gabbett et al., (2016) and combined with the low training load are unlikely to stress 
the athletes beyond their capacity.   
Tomar and Allen (2019) was the only study in the review to use the sRPE method  (Foster , 
1998; Foster et al., 2001)  of monitoring training load. This is in contrast to Eckard et al., 
(2018)  whose multisport review of fifty -seven studies found twenty -two (39%) of those 
studies measured internal training load using the sRPE method . A similar multisport 
review conducted by Drew and Finch (2016)  found that twenty -five out of a total of thirty -
five (71%) studies utilised sRPE. The significant difference between the frequency of 
sRPE use in swim specific research and a multisport resea rch highlight  how underutilised 
this method of monitoring training load is in competitive swimming research.  
Research surrounding training load has evolved to understand that neither high or low 
training load can be considered solely at fault for pain, in jury and illness (Gabbett 2016) . 
It is more central to consider the appropriate amount of training load or rate of load 
application for that individual athlete in order to maximise performance while 
simultaneously limiting maladaptation (Gabbett 2019; Griffin et al.  2020a) . Resea rch into 
monitoring changes in training load originated with Banister ’s “Training Stress Balance” 
method and developed into the ACWR in recent years (Griffin et al., 2020a) . The ACWR 
is designed to balance the most recent training loads (acute) with the athletes’ recent 
history of training load (chronic) in an effort to predict how fit or fatigued they are (Hulin 
et al., 2014) . The ACWR has been shown to quantify changes in training load by 
presenting a numerical range where training load is said to be at the “sweet spot” and 
injury risk is reduced (0.8 – 1.3) (Gabbett 2016) . It is important to note that this sweet 
spot numerical range can vary per population and individual physical capacities with team 
sports citing a ACWR sweet spot of 1.00 -1.25 (Malone et al., 2017)  and 0.85 -1.35 (Hulin 
et al., 2014) . This is crucial to an individual athlete sport like swimming where a squad 
“sweet spot” range cannot be relied upon and each individual’s ACWR needs to be 
quantified . While a number of studies have used this method to good effect in a variety 
of sports (Hulin et al., 2014; Carey et al., 2017; Delecroix et al., 2018; Bowen et al., 
2019) , the most accurate method of calculating the ACWR is contentious (Menaspà 2017; 
Williams et al.  2017) . A recent review by Griffin et al., (2020a) investigated the 
association between ACWR and injury in team sports. The review concluded that ACWR 
is associated with non -contact injuries which is a key finding for sports like swimming. 
The review also highlighted the key differences between the calcula tion of ACWR using 
the rolling average model and the exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) 
40 
 model. The rolling average model divides the acute workload by the chronic workload 
whereas the EWMA model accounts for the decaying nature of fitness and fat igue by 
applying a greater weight to the most recent loads (Griffin et al., 2020a) .  While the rolling 
average model has received more substantial attention in team  sport research, the review 
states that EWMA may be a more sensitive measure (Griffin et al., 2020a) . The 
applicability of these models warrants further investigati on, particularly in an elite 
swimming population where current research is severely limited.  
Hellard et al., (2015) quantified intensity levels where blood lactate concentration was 
mapped throughout a swim -specific step test (Mujika et al., 1996) . Session intensities 
were planned accordingly and in conjunction with meters per week. Low intensity 
training load was categorised as the mean percentage volume at intensity levels 1 -3, while 
high intensity training was categorised at intensity levels 4 and 5. Results of the study 
showed the odds of illness were 50% -70% higher during intensive training periods . The 
risk of illness was also increased during winter months, and in national level swimmers 
over international level swimmers. Coaches should be aware of the increased risks of 
URTPI during intensive training periods and should accurately measure and pro gramme 
the intensity and overall load of the sessions accordingly. The scheduling of intensive 
training periods should be strategic, keeping non -sport stress in mind and avoiding 
periods of high academic or professional responsibilities, or demanding compe tition 
calendars. This is particularly important during the winter months where the population 
risk of URTPI is already considerably high (Hellard et al., 2015). The findings also 
showed that for every 10% increase in training load, a corresponding 10% increase in the 
risk of illness was likely, which is in agreement with current evidence that has shown 
very high training loads, very low loads and rapid changes in load can al l contribute to 
illness (Schwellnus et al., 2016) . The findings indicate that recovery strategies during 
intensive training blocks should be given higher consideration than norm al. This is 
particularly important directly after acute maximal speed sessions (blood lactate ≥10 
mmo·L-1) as these sessions contributed most to increasing risk of illness. This finding is 
in line with general consensus that immune disturbances are associa ted with acute session 
intensity (Walsh et al., 2011) . A consensus statement (Walsh et al., 2011) highlighted that 
to maintain immune health, training programmes should involve gradual increases in 
volume and intensity and avoid sudden increases o r spikes. Adding variety of stimuli 
including cross -training methods and paying particular attention to recovery and 
nutritional strategies are also important (Walsh et al., 2011).  
41 
 2.6 Future Considerations  
The ability to synthesise the data and sum marise the findings is significantly restricted by 
study design, a variety of training load methods, large variations in population and 
operating definitions of pain, injury, and illness. The guidance of a consensus statement 
may have aided authors in coll ecting both internal and external training load, which in 
turn would have improved the strength of the results. However, as only four (Tessaro et 
al., 2017; Martins et al., 2018; Cejudo et al., 2019; Tomar and Allen 2019)  of the studies 
included in this systematic review were published after the introduction of the most recent 
FINA (Mountjoy et al., 2016)  and IOC (Schwellnus et al., 2016; Soligard et al., 2016)  
Consensus Guidelines covering load and the risk of injury and illness, their overall 
influence was diminished. Publication prior to 2016 reduced the likelihood of autho rs 
maintaining a high level of consensus in the operational definitions used for pain, injury,  
and illness, as well as the protocols used to collect that information. Nevertheless, only 
one of the four studies highlighted made reference to the IOC consensu s statement  (Tomar 
and Allen 2019) , with non e referencing the FINA consensus statement. This systematic 
review highlights the need to refer to these guidelines  prior to publishing research of this 
nature, ideally improving the study design and consistency across training load and 
injury/illness surv eillance methods.  
Conducting a meta -analysis was not possible within this review due to the large 
discrepancies between the studies’ definitions, analyses, data collection methods and load 
measures. Future research should strive to rectify the limitations  presented by this review 
by conforming to published consensus statements. If adherence to these guidelines was 
to increase going forward, the publication of a meta -analysis would be of significant 
benefit to researchers and practitioners alike.  
The FINA guidelines also recommend in and out -of-competition monitoring of athletes 
using a sport -specific tool such as OSTRC (Mountjoy et al., 2016) . This validated 
questionnaire has played an increasing role in sports injury and illness surveillance as i t 
is purposefully designed for the collection of conditions that are below the time -loss 
threshold (Bahr et al., 2020) .  
Load monitoring is largely a subjective practice and thus is reliant on an athlete’s recall 
of the key variables. While subjective measures have been shown to be more sensitive 
and consistent than objective measures in dete rmining homeostatic changes to load 
(Schwellnus et al., 2016) , their use in retrospective studies can lead to inaccuracies in 
42 
 data collection. Future research should focus on prospective cohort study design s as they 
are considered to be more reliable and generate real -time knowledge and allow for a more 
accurate estimation of the risk and incidence of injury and illness (Mukherjee 2015) .  
While a variety of training load measures can be used in the monitoring of athletes, it is 
clear that no one measure will provide a clear picture when used in isolation. The reliance 
upon training volume as an external training load measure in a variety of forms was 
unable to determine a standardised variable suitable for a swimming population. To that 
end, in line with recent consensus statements, a com bination of internal and external 
training load should be used in an integrated approach (Bourdon et al., 2017) .  
Future research also needs to explore the applicability of the sRPE method of monitoring 
internal training load within competitive swimming. A recent review by Eckard et al., 
(2018) found that 22/57 articles used the sRPE method to quantify session intensity. 
Statistically significant results were reported in 21 studies, with one study reporting all 
null findings (Eckard et al., 2018) . The collection of sRPE in conjunction with additional 
external training load provides the opportunity to investigate the effect of not only 
increased loads, but also changes in load. Unlike similar research in other sports, no study 
has investigated the links between training load and the incidence of pain, injury and 
illness in an elite swimming population using sRPE in a longitudinal prospective cohort 
study.  
Finally, research into elite competitive swimming populations is necessary to provide a 
clear picture of the associations between training load and pain, injury and illness for 
coaches and practitioners working at the highest echelons of the sport. Conduct ing 
research at elite level is often difficult due to the limited access, numbers of athletes and 
ability to implement good research processes in practical training environments. 
However, there is greater control and resources available at that level, with  less 
confounding factors affecting the results. A universal classification model as seen in 
Swann et al., (2015)  should be referred to when defining the athletes level of expertise, 
allowing for improved clarity and comparison of populations (Bahr et al., 2020) . 
2.7 Conclusions  
This systematic review provides an appraisal of the literature examining the re lationship 
between training load and pain, injury, and illness in competitive swimming. The findings 
highlight that the relationship between these variables is unclear owing to a host of 
43 
 methodological constraints associated with research in this field. Wh ile the relationship 
has yet to be established, the review highlights that youth, masters and competitive 
swimmers of a lower ability should receive particular attention. Planning of load within 
the seasonal calendar needs prudence, with winter months bein g a key period in the 
training cycle. Sessions of higher intensity and speed elements should be planned with 
caution. Monitoring and injury /illness  surveillance practices need to be developed in 
conjunction with consensus guidelines, ensuring load monitori ng includes both internal 
and external training loads. The use of longitudinal load monitoring of elite populations, 
utilising sRPE and investigating the applicability of the ACWR and EWMA approaches 
should be a priority for researchers going forward. This  will not only improve the quality 
of the research being conducted, but it  will also provide greater clarity on the relationship 
between training load and pain, injury, and illness.

The authors regret in the Future Considerations Section the following line should read:  
“However, as only four (Cejudo et al., 2019; Martins et al., 2018; Tessaro et al., 2017; 
Tomar & Allen, 2019) of the studies included in this systematic review were published 
after the introduction of the most recent FINA (Mountjoy et al., 2016) and IOC 
(Schwellnus et al., 2016; Soligard et al., 2016) Consensus Guidelines covering load and 
the risk of injury and illness, their overall influence was diminished”.  
2.9 Addendum  
Since the publication of this systematic review in 2021, a follow -up search was conducted 
to ensure the most accurate and up -to-date inform ation was included . As within the 
original review , studies examining illness and training load in this population are 
potentially underrepresented with no one study being highlighted in this search. Five 
studies (Feijen et al.  2021; Suzuki et al.  2021; Thomas et al.  2021; Mise et al.  2022; 
44 
 Pollen et al.  2022)  including pain and injury were reviewed and summarised. Partic ipant 
demographics were initially explored , with two stud ies investigating master -level 
swimmers  (Suzuki et al., 2021; Thomas et al., 2021) , one study investigating you th 
swimmers at club level  (Mise et al., 2022)  and one study including NCAA division 3 
swimmers  (Pollen et al., 2022) . The fifth study included participants from a var iety of 
backgrounds with ages ranging from 10 -40 years. All p articipant a ges ranged from 13 – 
65 years, with a variety of descriptors outlining the participants ’ level of ability . The term 
competitive was used in all f ive studies as per the inclusion crite ria, with one study citing 
swimmers training between 5533.3 – 6375.0 meters per session  (Mise et al., 2022) . One 
study reported  that the swimmers swam  for 10 months per year with a swimming 
experience of 7 -14 years  (Pollen et al., 2022) . Both m asters groups reported swimming 
frequency as days per week, wi th one group swimming a maximum of 3.3 ± 1.5 sessions 
per week  (Suzuki et al., 2021) and the other 3.3 ± 1.2 (Thomas et al., 2021)  sessions per 
week. Feijen et al.,  (2020) included several descriptors for training load including lifetime 
exposure (4.57 ± 2.37 years), time swam per week (8.65 ± 3.15 hrs) and meters swam per 
week (17,277.82 ± 32,286.70 m).  
Four  of the f ive studies investigated pain in their participants with all four focusing on 
shoulder pain specifically  (Feijen et al.  2021; Suzuki et al.  2021; Thomas et al.  2021; 
Mise et al.  2022) . Three of these studies used ret rospective questionnaires to ascertain the 
participants history of shoulder pain (Feijen et al.  2021; Suzuki et al.  2021; Thomas et al.  
2021)  while one prospective study had an athletic trainer visit the participants and 
interview them about the presence or a bsence of pain every 2 -3 months  (Mise et al., 
2022) . Pain was defined as “significant shoulder pain that interfered with training, 
competition or progression in training a nd caused cessation or modification of training or 
racing”  within this study. The final study reported specifically on non -contact 
musculoskeletal injury  (Pollen et al., 2022) . Injury was defined as, “any non -contact 
musculoskeletal pain that resulted from team activities and prevented the swimmer from 
participating in  a competition or at least 50% of 1 practice  as prescribed”.  As per the 
inclusion criteria, each paper also needed to report an internal or external training load 
measure.   These f ive articles consistently reported external  training load measures as with 
the original systematic review findings. Swim distance was the most commonl y reported 
measure with four of the five papers using this method (Feijen et al.  2021; Suzuki et al.  
2021; Thomas et al.  2021; Mise et al.  2022). A variety of swim distance descriptors were 
used to quantify training load, with y ards per day or year, average swimming distance per 
45 
 session in meters, and training volume in meters all featuring. Quantifying training load 
through duration was also common with months per year (Thomas et al., 2021; Pollen et 
al., 2022)  and hours swam per week (Feijen et al.  2021; Thomas et al.  2021)  both 
presented. The method of co llecting training was either by question naire (Feijen et al.  
2021; Suzuki et al.  2021; Thomas et al.  2021)  or through coaches (Pollen et al., 2022)  or 
athlete interview (Mise et al., 2022) .  
The relationship between training load and pain was examin ed in four studies, with one 
study reporting no significant difference in the number of years competing or training 
volume (Suzuki et al., 2021) . In the t hree remaining studies, one found that yards swam 
per day and per year was significantly lower in the positive pain and disability group  
(+PDD)  (Thomas et al., 2021) . Conversely , the other study found female swimmers with 
shoulder pain had significantly longer swim  distance s per session (Mise et al., 2022) . 
Feijen et al.,  (2020) found no statistic al difference between the basel ine characteristics of 
swimmers with and without shoulder pain. However, they did report that the rolling 
average ACWR, calculated using session volume, was a predictor for shoulder pain. The 
final study investigated the relationship between training load and injury  (Pollen et al., 
2022) . The study findings suggested that there was an association between i njury and 
both high acute workload and ACWR.  However, they also found that there was no 
association between high overall workload and chronic workload in collegiate athletes. 
Workload was calculated using distance swam only and did not factor in an interna l 
training load metric.  
The methodological inconsistencies in these studies exten d those highlighted in the 
original systematic review. The discrepant findings across these f ive additional studies 
does not add clarity  to the original findings which outlin ed no clear evidence of a 
relationship between training load and pain and limited evidence of a relationship 
between training load and injury. Even with the addition of these studies, pain is still the 
most frequently investigated condition with shoulder p ain being prioritised. The 
variability in what is considered a competitive athlete was also apparent with  a large range 
of training characteristics  being present . Across the f ive studies, youth, collegiate and 
masters’  groups were represented , which is consistent with  the original systematic review. 
When these s amples  were compared to their participant groups in the original systematic 
review some simil arities were found. It has been previously shown that m aster s swimm ers 
with pain swam lower volumes then their non -symptomatic counter parts (Krüger et al., 
2012) . It was suggested that the influence of age related changes in muscle mass and 
46 
 tendon degeneration (Barry et al., 2021)  could create a higher risk pain or injury at lower 
training thresholds. These findings are similar to that of Thomas et al., (2021 ) who also 
found master swimmers wit h +PDD  swam less than their non -symptomatic peers. 
Interestingly, within this study, the physical characteristics of the shoulder were also 
examined. The results showed that supraspinatus tendon structure was no different 
between groups, however , those who had a  +PDD displayed reduced shoulder mobility. 
In contrast to this finding, the second study to include masters swimmers did find some 
shoulder joint structural changes (Suzuki et al., 2021) , where earlier initiation in swim 
training and a longer history of competition increased the risk of supraspinatus and 
subscapularis tendinosis.  
Feijen et al.,  (2020) had the most varied group of athletes (n=200) with international, 
national, regional or club swimmers being included. They did not breakdown the results 
according to cohort making it difficult to compare to previously discussed populations. 
However , this study did report an association between ACWR and shoulder pain. The 
results highlighted that ACWR was one of the stronger predictors for shoulder pain (OR, 
4.13; 95%CI, 1.00 – 18.54). The authors concluded that based on these findings 
swimmers who w ere exposed to a 1 -unit increase in the ACWR, saw 4.3 times  increase 
in the odds of shoulder pain. On review of these results, the authors did not discuss what 
a 1-unit increase in ACWR referred to and thus limited the transferability of the results 
to an applied setting. The 95%CI presented with the odds ratios for this result was also 
very large suggesting that the finding had high levels of statistical uncertainty and could 
not be transferred with any degre e of precision.   
Youth swimmers were represente d in one study  (Mise et al., 2022)  which found different 
risk factors affected male and female swimmers separately. Swimming distance was 
significantly associated with shoulder pain in female swimmers but not male swimmers. 
The study highlighted that an increased focus on shoulder control  through strengthening 
could  aid their ability to tolerate greater swim distances. This finding was not evident  in 
the original systematic review where a similar youth age category was investigated in 
four studies. All four studies found no statistically s ignificant relationship between pain 
and training load across  participant groups.  
Pollen et al., (2022)  highlighted that in collegiate swimm ers, high acute workloads and 
ACWR were both associated with injury. Two studies in the original systematic review 
investigated collegiate swimmers, however the comparison of studies is difficult based 
47 
 on the variety of training load measures used and hugely va ried participant characteristics. 
Pollen et al., (2022) used a swim distance derived acute workload, chronic workload and 
ACWR with a division three collegiate population. Meanwhile, Tomar & Allen (2019) 
utilised a RPE and duration -based  workload metric bu t with a very small population with 
a low-level  training ability. Harrington et al., (2014) had a highly trained population 
represented at division one collegiate level and presented workload as hours per week or 
frequency of practices per week.  The high l evels of variability amongst collegiate 
swimmers make comparison and finding a consensus very challenging .

 2.10 Link to the Next Chapter  
Chapter one  provide d a broad outlook on the key concepts involved in this body of 
research . It outlines swimming as a competitive sport  and describes the injury and illness 
profile of competitive swimmers as described in the research. It also summarises the 
concept of trainin g load monitoring and outlines the most up to date consensus statements 
in injury and illness surveillance.  Crucially, Chapter one  identifie s key gaps and 
recommendations  as set out in the literature . Chapter two further  investigate d this gap 
within the research  and established a deeper understanding of the relationship between 
training load and pain, injury,  or illness. The findings of this study highlighted the reliance 
on external training load measures to monitor training load in competitive swimming 
research. It also emphasised methodological inconsistencies in the research and low 
adherence to the most recent FINA and IOC injury/illness surveillance consensus 
statements. Chapter three aimed to investigate the training load monitoring practices 
within  the practical competitive swimming environment. The goal was to deepen the 
understanding  of training load monitoring practices in the a pplied setting and better 
comprehend  how they related to the findings with Chapter two.  In sum, this study sought 
to examine if  the methods of training load monitoring used in a research context were the 
methods used in an applied setting.

 3.1 Abstract   
Introduction:  Competitive swimming has typically been associated with large training 
demands.  Coaches strategically fluctuate training load and recovery to push the limits of 
adaptation and avoid overtraining, injury or detraining . Training load monitoring in 
swimming has traditionally been seen to be reliant upon coaches’  previous experience 
and intuition.  
Aims:  The purpose of this study is to identify the training load monitoring practices 
employed in real -world competitive swimming environments. The study explores data 
collection, analysis,  and barriers to  training load monitoring.  
Methods:  Employing a cross -sectional design, an online sur vey was distributed to 
international practitioners working in competitive swimming environments. Methods of 
data collection, analysis, level of effectiveness and barriers associated with training load 
monitoring  were explored . 
Results:  Thirty -one responder s working in competitive swimming programmes  
responded . 83.9% of responders acknowledged using  training load monitoring, with 
80.8% of responders using a combination of both internal and external training load , in 
line with current consensus statements. Swim volume (mileage) (96 .2%) and session rate 
of perceived exertion (sRPE) (92 .3%) were the most frequently used, with athlete 
lifestyle/wellness monitoring also featuring prominently. Thematic analysis highlighted 
that “stakeholder engagement”, “resource constraints” or “functionality and usability of 
the systems” were shared barriers to  training load monitoring amongst responders.  
Conclusions:  Findings show there is a research -practice gap. Future approaches to  
training load monitoring in competitive swimming should focus on selecting methods that 
allow the same  training load monitoring system to be used across the whole programme, 
(pool -based training, dryland training and competition). Barriers associated with athlete 
adherence and coach /National Governing Body engagement should be addressed before 
a training load systems implementation.

 3.2 Introduction  
Swimming competitions are scheduled over several days and typically incorporate heats, 
semi -finals, and finals. While the majority of events last no longer than two minutes and 
twenty seconds, the traditional training practices of competitive swimmers are high in 
volume (m/km/min) (Nugent et al., 2019) . Careful planning and periodization are at the 
forefront of achieving success at elite performance  levels (Hellard et al., 2019) . Coaches 
strategically f luctuate training load and recovery to push the limits of adaptation and avoid 
overtraining, injury or detraining (Hellard et al., 2019) . The popularity of  training load 
monitoring in sport has grown considerably in recent years (Newton et al., 2019)  and has 
been the focus of much interest in the scientific approach to training and recovery (Hamlin 
et al., 2019) . This is primarily due to increased sports science support (Foster et al., 2017) , 
technological developments (Hauer et al., 2020)  and professionalisation of sport (Gabbett 
2016) .  
Training load  monitoring is multi -dimensional, often incorporating measures of tr aining 
frequency, intensity and duration, monitoring heart rate alterations, neuromuscular 
function,  biochemical/hormonal/immunological markers and subjective wellness 
measures (Halson 2014) . Training load  can be divided into internal and external load 
(Bourdon et al., 2017) . External load is most commonly collected and includes objective 
measures of the work performed by the athlete ( e.g., power output, speed and distance). 
Internal loads are the relative biological stressors imposed on the athlete (e.g. heart rate, 
rate of perceived exertion (RPE), session rate of perceived exertion (sRPE) and blood 
lactate) (Bourdon et al., 2017) . There is a consensus that both internal and  external loads 
should be considered congruently , however, no one marker has been validated to identify 
a maladaptation to training and thus , a holistic approach to  training load monitoring is 
needed (Soligard et al., 2016) .  
The pursuit of best practice related to  training load monitoring has caused an exponential 
increase in empirical and applied research (Bourdon et al., 2017) . Much of this research 
has focused on land -based sport, as opposed to Olympic aquatic sports ( i.e., diving, open -
water swimming, pool swimming, synchronised swimming and wate r polo). Three 
systematic reviews have been published in recent years, investigating the relationship 
between training load , injury, illness or soreness in a broad range of sports (Drew and 
Finch , 2016; Jones et al., 2017; Eckard et al., 2018) . Of the 160 studies reviewed, just six 
studies included aquatic -based populations. A recent narrative review summarised the 
52 
 monitoring strategies used to quantify a swimmers  training load within sports medicine 
research (Feijen, Tate, Kuppens, Barry, et al.  2020) . The review (28 studies) highlighted 
that external  training load (19/28) was frequently monitored through the collection of 
swimming volume (average distance, duration swam per week o r year) and dryland 
volume (hours per week). The use of internal  training load (23/28) was also investigated 
with blood lactate concentration testing and heart rate monitoring being commonly 
employed. However, in this research context, both heart rate and blood lactate were often 
used as a criterion value to determine the validity and reliability of other markers in 
estimating the internal training load . RPE , sRPE (8/28) and psychological 
parameters/scales (3/28) were used to a lesser extent within the rese arch investigated. 
Collette et al., (2018) and Zera et al., (2015) did investigate psychological parameters in 
more detail and found that psychological variables have high inter/intra individual 
differences and can fluctuate throughout a season to align wi th periods of high and low  
training load (Zera et al., 2015; Collette et al., 2018)  
Even with the increased popularity and i mplementation of  training load monitoring in 
professional sport, research into  training load monitoring in competitive swimming is 
growing but not widespread. This narrative review (Feijen, Tate, Kuppens, Barry, et al.  
2020)  presents a clear picture of the monitoring strategies being employed in sports 
medicine research. However, as the findings rely on monitoring strategies used within a 
research context , it may not truly reflect the practices employed in a real -world context. 
Therefore, this study aimed to identify the  training load monitoring practices being used 
in competitive swimming environments, w hile also exploring how data collection and 
analysis are being implemented and what measures are considered effective. Finally, 
barriers and facilitators to  training load monitoring were also examined.  
3.3 Methods  
3.3.1 Experimental Approach to the Problem  
A survey was designed to explore the  training load monitoring practices of high -
performance support teams in competitive swimming.  The overarching research question 
was deliberately designed using interpretive methods, rather than a leading hypothesis. 
An o pen survey was self -administered through an online platform (Qualtrics.com). The  
training load survey consisted of thirty -eight questions including open and closed 
questions , and used branch, display,  and skip logic functions to tailor the content 
dependin g on the specific responses. The study is reported in line with the Checklist for 
53 
 Reporting Results of Internet Surveys (CHERRIES) (Eysenbach 2004) . A copy of the 
survey is available online ( appendix 3.1) along with the CHERRIES checklist ( appendix 
3.2) authors used to ensure a complete description of this web -based survey was provided 
(Eysenbach 2004) .  
3.3.2 Participants  
The survey w as circulated globally, using swimming National Governing Bodies (NGBs) 
from Ireland, Great Britain & Northern Ireland, Spain, Australia,  and New Zealand, as 
well as a number of  coaching associations (International Swim Coaches Association, 
World Coaches Swimming Association, UK Strength and Conditioning Association). In 
addition, coaches,  and practitioners from the NGBs were asked to circulate the survey to 
relevant contacts wit hin the swimming community. It was requested that the individual 
whose primary responsibility was  training load monitoring within their swim programme, 
irrespective of their job title, w ould be  invited to complete the survey. A total of 58 
responses were c ollected, with 31 complete responses being included. The remaining 27 
responses were excluded due to not reaching a completeness rate >85% on primary 
questions (excluding branch logic and optional open -ended questions). Ethical approval 
was granted by the University’s Ethics Committee ( 2019_10_09_EHS ). Participant 
information sheets (including a GDPR statement) (appendix 3.3) were circulated with the 
questionnaire and each participant had to agree to an online informed consent form to 
participate in the res earch.   
3.3.3 Procedures  
The online survey  was circulated primarily by email, but also through social media 
platforms (LinkedIn, Twitter). The aims, objectives and duration of the survey were 
included with each email, along with a participant information sheet.  Data were collected 
from March 2020 to July 2020.  Data gathered were identified using a code number and 
unnecessary personal details were not recorded or used in any part of this project. All data 
were stored in a locked filing cabinet in the principal r esearcher’s office or password -
protected/encrypted based on the data type. Unique responses were identified using the 
IP address of the participant. IP addresses were crosschecked for duplications in 
Microsoft Excel during analysis and not used if found to  be a replication. The survey 
consisted of five blocks: (1) informed consent; (2) demographics; (3) training load 
monitoring practices; (4) barriers to training load monitoring; and (5) open -ended 
questions. Open -ended questions sought to give the responde r the option of providing 
54 
 additional information on the links between  training load monitoring and additional 
aspects of their programme and the barriers experienced with accurate  training load 
monitoring. Participants could review questions, go back, and change answers throughout 
the survey. The survey was pilot tested, refined and redrafted in consultation with two 
academic colleagues with a background in survey design, as well as two multi -sport high -
performance support staff who regularly use  training l oad monitoring systems in a 
practical setting. Modifications of the survey in line with these consultations came in the 
form of improved technical terminology, clarity on the phrasing of the questions and 
removal of irrelevant questions. Finally, the surve y was sent to two support staff working 
in a high -performance swim programme who completed the survey for a trial analysis.  
3.3.4 Statistical Analyses  
Responses were typically analysed using frequency analysis within Microsoft Excel. 
Absolute frequencies and pe rcentages were most commonly used to report the data. 
Where data were qualitative, a thematic analysis was used (Braun et al., 2016) . The 
them atic analysis employed a six -step process, including data familiarisation, coding, 
theme selection, refining themes, defining themes and finalising the report (Braun et al., 
2016) . Line by line coding was applied to the answers to the open -ended questions by one 
author (LB). Themes were then developed from these codes by two authors (LB, KM). 
Representative quotations were extracted and presented for each theme.  
3.4 Results  
A total of  31 responders participated fully in the survey. The result sections 
“demographics” and “barriers to  training load monitoring” includes responses from all 31 
responders. Five responders reported not using  training load monitoring practices and 
therefore, s ections reporting on  training load monitoring practices only includes the 
remaining 26 responders.  
3.4.1 Demographics  
Out of 31 responders, 58 .1% were swim coaches, 7 7.8% of whom had greater than ten 
years’ experience in competitive swimming. The remaining resp onders included sport 
scientists (19 .4%), strength and conditioning (S&C) coaches (1 2.9%), physiologists 
(6.5%) and physiotherapists (3 .2%). Academic and industry -specific qualifications were 
common aspects of the responders’ education. Almost all responde rs (96.8%) had some 
level of academic qualification, while most (90 .3%) had an industry -specific 
55 
 qualification. Most responders (87 .1%) coached athletes across a range of abilities. 
Practitioners of national standard athletes were most frequently represent ed (87 .1%), 
followed by international level (77 .4%) and club level athletes (4 1.9%).  
3.4.2 Training Load  Monitoring Practices  
Out of 31 responders, five (16 .1%) declared that they did not employ  training load 
monitoring practices in their swim programme. These five responders consisted of three 
swim coaches (60%), one S&C coach (20%) and one physiologist (20%).  The remaining 
26 responders (8 3.9%) who did employ  training load monitoring practices were asked to 
rank the top three goals of their  training load monitoring practices. The frequency at 
which each goal was ranked at (one, two or three ) is presented in Table 3-1. The goal to 
“monitoring athlete’s resp onse to training” was ranked most frequently at number one 
which was closely followed by “improve athlete performance”.

Responders were asked to outline the methods they used to monitor  training load within 
their programmes and to highlight the types of variables they collected. A small 
percentage ( 7.7%) of responders only collected internal  training load markers, with some 
responders (11 .5%) collecting external  training load markers exclusively. A substantial 
number of responders (8 0.8%) collected both internal and external  trainin g load markers. 
Several responders (69 .2%) used two or more methods to collect and record their  training 
load data. The most widely used method was Microsoft Excel or similar software 
(44.7%), followed by a specifically designed software package (2 3.7%), p en and paper 
(15.8%) and a generic web -based tool such as Google Docs (13 .2%). The responsibility 
of recording the data was predominantly split between the swim coach (46 .2%) and self -
reported by the athlete (3 4.6%). S&C coaches ( 7.7%) and sports science support staff

collection/reporting.  
56 
 (11.5%) were also reported to be responsible for data collection. Data were generally 
recorded immediately post -session (6 1.5%) or within the first hour (1 1.5%). Data were 
recorded within twenty -four hours’ post -session i n 26.9% of ca ses. Some data was 
recorded once a week (11.5%).  
Responders were asked to outline the type of variables collected as part of their  training 
load practices. Training volume (mileage) (96 .2%) and sRPE (92 .3%) were the primary 
data variables collected, close ly followed by subjective ratings of lifestyle/wellness 
(73.1%), heart rate (69 .2%) and total load (RPE x Duration) (69 .2%). Sleep duration and 
quality (7 8.9%) were variables collected as a key lifestyle/wellness metric. Psychological 
questionnaires (Profi le of Mood States Questionnaire, Daily Analysis of Life Demands 
Questionnaire, Recovery -Stress Questionnaire for Athletes, Multicomponent Training 
Distress Scale) (42 .1%) and energy, fatigue, and soreness Likert scales (21 .1%) were also 
frequently utilised  under this category.   
Biomarkers (2 6.9%) and objective measures of fatigue (19 .2%) featured less often in the  
training load practices of the responders. Of those who did monitor fatigue, assessments 
such as a swim specific set were reportedly used (71 .4%) as well as countermovement 
jumps (57 .1%), handgrip strength (57 .1%) and self -reported questionnaires (57 .1%). 
Similarly, responders who monitored biomarkers highlighted that cardiovascular status 
(e.g., Serum Ferritin, Haemoglobin) (6 6.7%), muscle status  (e.g., IGF-1, Cortisol, 
Creatine Kinase) (33 .3%), metabolic status ( e.g., Glucose, Lipids, HbA1c) (33 .3%), 
salivary biomarkers (1 6.7%), as well as hydration status ( e.g., Urine Specific Gravity, 
Osmolality) (1 6.7%) were used in  training load monitoring practices.  
Responders were also asked how  training load data were sub -categorised during data 
analysis and how data were reported. Responders sub -categorised the data into multiple 
groups in 50% of the responses, with 6 1.5% of th ose categorising both swim and dryland  
training load separately. Categorising swim sessions by session target (speed, aerobic, 
race pace) was also popular (38 .5%). A  large portion  (92.3%) of responders used two or 
more methods in combination to report the data, with the hierarchy of methods being 
presented in  Figure 3-1.

Figure 3-1 The percentage of selected  training load analysis categories used by 26 
responders (responders could select multiple options).  
When asked who made the key decision s based on the  training load data, responders 
indicated that either a head coach (61 .5%) or a swim coach (2 6.9%) were largely 
responsible. Ninety -six per cent of responders  indicated that they provided  training load 
information back to the athlete after analysis. Fifty -eight per cent of those always 
provided feedback, while 38 .5% provided feedback in a specific circumstanc e. The 
responders were provided with the opportunity to give further information on the 
circumstances where they would provide feedback to the athlete, which is presented in 
the qualitative data below.  
Responders also contributed information on the effect iveness of their  training load 
monitoring practices in key situations ( i.e., improving performance, preventing injury, 
informing training prescription and enhancing training adaptations). Figure 3-2 shows 
the breakdown of the responses. Monitoring  training load was seen as very effective in 
terms of improving performance and enhancing training adaptations but only moderately 
effective in  relation to preventing injury and informing training prescription.   8569623131151515124

3.4.3 Barriers Preventing Training Load Monitoring  
Five responders (16 .1%) stated that they did not employ any  training load monitoring 
practices. The barriers that prevented them from employing  training load monitoring 
practices were cited as “limited time” (5 0%) “lack of support from coaching team” (25%), 
“insufficient funding available” (12.5%) and the “age/experience level of their athletes” 
(12.5%).  
3.4.4 Open -Ended Section  
Responders were asked if they found a specific  training load variable or metric most 
effective in helping to prevent injury. The open -ended responses highlighted the use of 
specific  training load metrics, wellness markers and physiological assessments. Many of 
the responders cited specific  training load monitoring metrics that they felt we re helpful, 
such as the acute chronic workload ratio (ACWR) which is a method of quantifying 
fitness and fatigue by using the most recent  training load (acute) with the athletes’ recent 
history of  training load (chronic) (Hulin et al., 2014) .  Internal versus external load was 
also highlighted and is a method of quantifying fitness and fatigue status based on 
different variables used (i.e. total distance: TRIMP) (Akubat et al., 2018) . Variables such 
as monotony and strain were mentioned as being helpful. Training monotony is a measure 
of day -to-day training variability, while training strain is a value that represents the 
overall stress that the athlete was exposed to (Comyns and Flanagan 2013) . Finally, 
training impulse (TRIMP) which i s a method of quantifying physical effort using training 4

 duration and heart rate during exercise (Halson 2014)  was also referred to.  The word 
cloud below ( Figure 3-3) highlights the interactions of the keywords within the 
responses. This word cloud was developed through a frequency analysis, where phrases 
or themes within the responses were counted. The s ize of the word or phrase within the 
word cloud is adjusted based on the frequency seen within the responses ( i.e., the larger 
the word, the more frequently it was mentioned). In this instance three sizes (Font size 
20, 40, 60) were used, the smallest word s were mentioned once,  and the largest words 
were mentioned three times.  
 
Figure 3-3 Word cloud representation of the specific variables, which are deemed  to be 
most effective in preventing injury.  
A thematic analysis was conducted  for the open -ended questions. Three higher -order 
themes were prevalent across all questions and are presented below. Table 3-2 highlights  
the higher -order themes, along with representative quotations from responders.  
3.4.4.1  Stakeholder Engagement  
Stakeholder ( i.e., athlete, coach, support staff, NGB) engagement was a major recurring 
theme across all open -ended questions. Responders were asked to report on the situations 
where  training load feedback was given to the athlete. Feedback was often provided when 
the athle tes' data were showing abnormalities or when trying to generate athlete 
engagement. Feedback was provided to educate or reassure the athlete, ensuring the 
athlete would see personal value in the information. This theme was also prominent when 
stakeholders were asked about barriers to accurately monitoring training load. Training 

60 
 load monitoring was made difficult due to a lack of compliance from the athletes. This, 
coupled with a coach’s reluctance to engage with the information and an unwillingness 
to make  adaptations based on the information were considerable barriers. When asked 
how training load monitoring could be made easier, the role of the stakeholder was 
frequently highlighted. It was suggested that a top -down approach to the application of a  
traini ng load monitoring culture within the system would be of benefit.  
3.4.4.2  Resource Constraints  
Resource constraints were another determinative factor in the application of  training load 
monitoring. When asked if any links between  training load variables warranted further 
investigation, logistical issues in handling the data tended to hamper progress. This theme 
carried over directly into the barriers of  training load monitoring, where resources such 
as support, finances and time were highlighted as major barriers. Additional personnel, 
undertaking separate data collection and analysis roles, was seen as a potential solution 
to these issues. This opinion was echoed when responders were asked what they felt may 
be important in effectively monitoring and recording  training load at an elite level. It was 
suggested that an experienced sport science support practitioner within the system would 
be vital to effective monitoring and recording at an elite level.  
3.4.4.3  Functionality and Usability  
The function ality of the technological systems involved in  training load monitoring were 
consistently highlighted across the responses , particularly when the barriers and solutions 
to training load monitoring were discussed. It was emphasised that technology, includin g 
software and hardware systems, need to be more user -friendly, sport -specific, reliable,  
and cost -effective. Responders remarked that standard  training load monitoring systems 
may not always be specific to swimming and the information can go against a coa ch’s 
perceptions. Responders also commented that at an elite level, the data analysis must be 
more sensitive to additional factors outside of training load . External factors such as 
lifestyle stress and sleep need to be accounted for while the need for det ailed 
biomechanical analysis is also greater, as the technical efficiency of swimming needs to 
be quantified.

 3.5 Discussion  
This study aimed to identify  training load monitoring practices in competitive swimming 
and is the first to explore these concepts concertedly in this population. The survey 
explored how data collection and analysis is implemented, what metrics a re being utilised 
and their perceived effectiveness. The barriers and facilitators to  training load monitoring 
were also investigated. The findings show that swimming coaches are primarily 
responsible for  training load monitoring, while physiotherapists an d S&C coaches were 
represented to a lesser extent and tended to work in swimming for the least amount of 
time. The lower responses from support staff may be linked to the relatively new influence 
of these practitioners in competitive swimming. The majority  of responders worked with 
multi -ability groups, highlighting the need for a  training load monitoring system to be 
age/ability appropriate. The key finding that 8 3.9% of responders participated in some 
level of  training load monitoring is higher than amate ur rugby (Griffin, Kenny, Comyns 
and Lyons 2021)  and highlights how swimming has  incorporated the implementation  of 
sports science support.  
The hierarchy of  training load monitoring goals ( Table 3-1) illustrates that responders 
were more driven towards performance outcomes than  injury prevention. While 
historically,  training load monitoring was performance -orientated (Foster et al., 2017) , its 
utilisation for injury risk mitigation has increased considerably (West et al., 2020) . 
Research suggests that using  training load monitoring as a predictor for injury is not best 
practice and may encourage a  risk-averse culture of protecting athletes rather than 
preparing them for the  training load needed to promote physical adaptation (Impellizzeri 
et al., 2020) . The primary role of  training load  monitoring should be t o act as a safeguard 
for the coaches’ periodization strategy. It can be used to assess if the athlete trained as 
planned or coped as expected. This allows both the art and science of coaching to work 
in harmony. Based on these goals, monitoring the athlete s’ perception of effort, as well 
as the amount of work completed is essenti al.  
The widespread implementation of both internal and external  training load markers is in 
accordance with the consensus statement recommendations on  training load monitoring 
(Bourdon et al., 2017) . The high prevale nce of sRPE as an internal  training load measure 
is in agreement with other sport disciplines. The popularity of monitoring external  
training load as the weekly or daily volume (m/km/min) is a common theme in endurance -
based sports, particularly in swimmin g and running where it is easily quantified and 
63 
 prescribed (Casado et al., 2019) . Nevertheless, caution is needed as training stress can be 
underestimated using training volume  (m/km/min) in isolation (Paquette et al., 2020) . 
The addition of an internal  training load metric such as sRPE or total load (RPE x 
Duration) provides a more complete quantification of an athlete’s overall  training load 
stress. The use of volume (m/km/min) or mileage as a key external  training load measure 
was anticipated. However, the high prevalence of subjective internal  training load (sRPE) 
is more surprisi ng. The use of sRPE was seen to be limited in a recent systematic review 
examining pain, injury and illness in competitive swimmers (Barry et al., 2021) . This 
review conclude d that monitoring  training load in competitive swimming research often 
did not include a measure of both internal and external training load , while the use of 
sRPE needed more extensive inclusion in the sport of swimming. These findings are in 
direct contr ast to the findings in this paper, showing a research -practice gap.  
Heart rate was another  training load measure frequently employed by responders (69 .2%), 
which is in agreement with other research (Feijen, Tate, Kuppens, Barry, et al.  2020) . 
Environmentally, the swimming arena provides logistical challenges to accurately 
monitoring heart rate. However, ne w technologies have made it possible to accurately 
track heart rate in real -time during a session (Olstad et al., 2019) , allowing  training load 
monitoring methods such as TRIMP to be utilised. TRIMP was reportedly used by 15 .4% 
of the responders within this survey. This method has received some criticism for its use 
of a total session mean heart rate, encompassing both “wor king” and “resting” intervals 
during the session, possibly underestimating the total stress of the session (García -Ramos 
et al., 2015) . It also has difficulties in monitoring all aspects of a sw im programme. 
Swimming training typically comprises of pool -based training, with a variety of session 
targets (speed, aerobic, anaerobic etc.) and dryland training. The use of a  training load 
measure relying on mean heart rate may not be accurately transfe rable to all types of 
training activities (Hellard et al., 2006) . The responders of this survey tended to separate 
the swimming and dryland -based  training loa d in most cases, while others categorised  
training load by session target. It would seem appropriate to use a measure of  training 
load that accurately depicts all aspects of a modern training regime and break the  training 
load into sub -categories such as t otal training load , swim  training load separated per 
session target and dryland training load .  
In addition,  training load measures including subjective ratings of lifestyle/wellness were 
often collected by responders and primarily involved the collection of sleep duration and 
quality. Sleep quantity and quality have been linked to performance and is seen as an 
64 
 essential aspect of an athlete’s physical preparation (Surda et al., 2019) . Swimmers have 
been shown to suffer from significantly poorer sleep profiles than their fellow athletes 
(Biggins et al., 2020) . This is thought to be a result of the early morning training cultur e 
(Sargent et al., 2014) .  Sleep disturbances have also been linked to increased  training load 
(Taylor et al., 1997)  and are prevalent amongst “dual career” student -athlete swimmers, 
particularly during periods of high academic stress and competition periods (Astridge et 
al., 2021) . This suggests that the collection of subjective wellness data, in combination 
with training load and sleep quantity and quality are appropriate for a swimming 
population and are particularly necessary for stud ent-athletes.  
Monitoring  training load is used to determine the individual athletes’ response to training 
and to regulate the training stimulus to improve the effectiveness of training, without 
increasing the risk of maladaptation (Bourdon et al., 2017) . Responders indicated that  
training l oad monitoring was very effective in improving performance and enhancing 
training adaptations. Responders also found  training load monitoring to be moderately 
effective in terms of injury prevention and moderately effective in terms of informing 
training p rescription. The prediction of performance or injury has been a major debate 
topic in recent times (McCall et al., 2017) . Despite this, research has yet to conclusively 
cite training load monitoring as a definitive predictive tool (Akenhead and Nassis 2016) . 
This is primarily due to the multifactorial nature of sport and quantifying  training load 
alone is not sufficient to accurately predict performance (Mitchell et al., 2020)  or injury 
(Impellizzeri et al., 2020) . Considering the lack of predictive qualities,  training load 
monitoring should be used in combination with the practitioners’ experience, allowing an 
informed decision -making process to occur.  
A key goal of this survey was to investigate t he barriers to  training load monitoring and 
three fundamental themes emerged; 1) stakeholder engagement; 2) resource constraints 
and 3) functionality or usability of the systems available. Athlete adherence to providing 
the information, the coaches’ reluct ance to engage with the information provided, and a 
lack of sufficient financial, personnel or technological support from NGBs, are all 
interlinked barriers to  training load monitoring. Successful implementation of  training 
load monitoring is strongly rela ted to end -user buy -in (Neupert et al., 2019) . Athletes 
have reported that feedback on their  training load data is a significant factor in their 
adherence (Neupert et al., 2019) . Nearly all responders in this survey indicated that they 
provided  training load information back to the athlete after analysis, with some of those 
only doing so when the athlete needs reassurance or when ensuring the athlete would see 
65 
 personal value in the information. As athlete feedback is a key consideration in creating 
a culture of buy -in, the method of feedback needs consideration.  A training load report 
sent to the athletes may not be sufficient as the athlete’s understanding of the information 
cannot be assumed. Practical, periodic face -to-face discussions may be better received, 
allowing the athlete to ask questions in real -time.   
The coaches’ reluctance to engage with the information was another frequently cited 
barrier. Saw et al., (2017) noted that the decision to implement a  training load monitoring 
system should be dependent on a commitment to the process from the coaching te am and 
the NGB . This stakeholder engagement process can be improved through formal or 
informal education of those involved, including clear protocols on how the system is used, 
data responsibility and how it will benefit the sports organisation/individuals (Saw et al., 
2017) . 
The NGB can also play a substantial role in barriers surrounding “stakeholder 
engagement” and “resource constraints”. A recent study on the complexities of 
implementing a  training load monitoring system highlighted that while stakeholder buy -
in was important, this importance needs to translate into the applied setting (Duignan et 
al., 2019) . An example of this would be a situation where an athlete, who does not 
adequately adhere to  training load monitoring practices within a squad, continuously gets 
“rewarded” through NGB funding or support systems. This diminishes the importance of  
training load monitoring within the system and may disrupt  global athlete engagement in 
the process.  
Responders also emphasi sed logistical issues, time and resources and lim ited workforce 
as being major contributing factors. The NGB can play a strong role in this aspect of the  
training load monitoring process. The implantation and success of such a system relies 
on its feasibility in the applied setting (Saw et al., 2017) . If the available resources do not 
meet the demands of the monitoring process, then it may be necessary for the NGB to 
support the process through financial investment, staff recr uitment or redeployment of 
skilled labour. The investment of technology may help offset the cost of practitioner hours 
by automating the  training load monitoring process (Saw et al., 2017)  Our findings 
showed that a sole staff position dedicated to the role of  training load monitoring and 
sport science services would be of great benefit. Amplified support from the NGB in the 
form of providing a skilled and knowledgeable practiti oner may consequently improve 
the decision -making processes by reducing the lag time to process and analyse the data. 
66 
 The accuracy of the data collected may also improve, thus improving the insight gained 
from the training load monitoring system. The influ ence of the NGB in reinforcing a 
training load monitoring culture from the top down is also of utmost importance.  
While it is imperative to quantify training load , the assessment of competition load is of 
equal importance. An athlete’s load cannot be accurately reviewed and acted upon unless 
all elements are considered (Mujika 2017) . There is some research to suggest the 
reporting of competition loads are difficult, given the influence of the environment and 
psychological state of the athletes (Griffin, Kenny, Comyns and Lyons 2021) . The ability 
to quantify competition loads can be hampered by the method used. Using  measures such 
as live heart rate i s not a viable option in the competition environment, while using 
external measures such as volume (m/km/min) may severely under -report the stress of 
maximal exertion in the athlete over shorter distances. Those using a subjective rating of 
internal  traini ng load (e.g., sRPE), alongside an external measure (e.g., duration) may be 
best placed to gather an accurate representation of the competition stress. The sRPE 
method can be applied to all elements of activity during the competition process, 
including on -deck mobility, priming activities, swim -based  warm -up, racing and cool 
down.  
3.6 Limitations  
The survey was circulated globally (1) to NGBs from Ireland, Great Britain & Northern 
Ireland, Spain, Australia and New Zealand (2) to a number of coaching associatio ns and 
(3) through social media outlets. However, t he nature of circulating a survey 
internationally through specific contact points within an NGB resulted in two limitations 
to this study. The first is the inability to track non -respondents as well as tho se who 
completed the survey in full, outside of the initial contact point.  Consequently, the 
response rate (as defined by  Phillips et al. , (2017)  cannot be calculated and presented . It 
is also not possible to confirm the degree of international representation of the data.  
3.7 Practical Applications  
Those wishing to implement a  training load monitoring system should consider 
stakeholder buy -in and financial, personnel and technological res ources. The NGB needs 
to be invested in the  training load requirements of the programme, while the coaching 
staff also need to create a culture of importance on the collection and utilisation of  training 
load data. This can be done by having a dedicated me mber of staff for  training load 
67 
 monitoring services. Once the system is in place, athlete adherence to reporting the data 
can be improved through the feedback of individual athlete  training load information.  
Findings showed that practitioners primarily us ed training load data to monitor the 
athlete’s response to training and to improve performance, while injury prevention was 
less of a priority. This would suggest that  training load data needs to be specific to the 
individual athlete and reviewed with trai ning and competition performance in mind.  
Much of the research into competitive swimming relies heavily on external  training load 
and rarely features the use of sRPE (Barry et al., 2021) . However, the findings of this 
survey highlight that both internal and external  training load are frequently collected by 
practitioners. The frequent use of sRPE as a  training load measure is a welcome finding, 
it does highlight that there is a gap between research and real -world application. Those 
wishing to design a  training load monitoring system for competitive swimming should 
prioritise the use of sRPE. sRPE is beneficial in competitive swimming as it can trans cend 
all aspects of a modern -day swim programme. Dryland activities, competition and swim  
training load can be quantified utilising the same method, allowing for an accurate 
measure of total training load . The reporting of  training load data can be done by  splitting 
swim and dryland activities and potentially further sub -categorising the  training load into 
swim sessions by session target (speed, aerobic, race pace). Lifestyle and wellness data 
should also be considered an important aspect of the monitoring process with sleep quality 
and quantity used as key metrics, especially for student -athletes.

 3.8 Link to the Next Chapter  
The aim of this study  was to identify the training load monitoring practices employed in 
real-world competitive swimming environments . It also explored the data collection and 
analysis process as well as identified barriers to training load monitoring in competitive 
swimming. Chapter three found that in an applied setting , training load monit oring 
practices were reliant on both internal and external training load metrics which contrasts 
with the finding of Chapter two. Chapter t hree also highlighted the frequen t use  of the 
sRPE method which was  not reflected in the literature. Wellness measures,  such as sleep 
duration and quality were also commonly monitored within a competitive swimming 
environment . The findings of this study  identified  that practitioners and coaches utilise 
training load monitoring with a view to impacting performance, whereas injury 
prevention was less of a priority. Barriers to training load monitoring included 
stakeholder engagement, resource constraints and system functionality. This chapter 
highlights key aspect s of the monitoring system design and alongside Chapter two creates 
a basis for the design and implementation of a training load m onitoring system. Relatedly , 
a similar investigation into the injury surveillance practices of real -world competitive 
swimming environments  needs to be completed to make an informed decision on the 
design of the injury surveillance monitoring aspect of the system. Chapter four 
investigates the injury surveillance practices of practitioners and coaches working within 
competitive sw imming.

 4.1 Abstract  
Introduction:  Swimmers  typically  train and compete with persistent health problems , 
with more injuries occurring during training than in competition. Injury preventio n in 
swimming is a crucial aspect of the sport to maintain consistent training practices and 
prevent unnecessary performance decrements. Injury surveillance is a critical step in the 
injury prevention process.  
Aims:  The purpose of this study was to identify the injury surveillance practices being 
used in competitive swimming environments. It explored the nature of the data collected, 
the injury definitions used and the perceived effectiveness of injury surveillance. Finally, 
this study also examined barriers to injury surveillance.  
Methods:  Employing a cross -sectional design, an online survey was distributed to 
international practitioners working in competitive swimming environments. Injury 
surveillance methods, data collected, perceived level of effe ctiveness and barriers 
associated with injury surveillance  were explored . 
Results: Twenty -two responders working in competitive swimming  responded to the 
survey. Fifteen responders participated in injury surveillance, with 13 responders using a 
recognised definition for injury. Ten responders did not use any sports injury 
classification system. Ten responders found injury surveillance to be very effective at 
identifying injury trends, while previous injury history and training load data were 
perceived to be  influential in preventing injury. Limited time, funding and compliance 
were common obstacles, while poor  staff communication and engagement were  barriers 
to the effective implementation of  injury surveillance.  
Conclusions:  The implementation of injury sur veillance is related to the system 
objectives,  competitive level of those under surveillance and the resources available. This 
implementation  requires the balance of adhering to the principles outlined in prominent 
consensus statements and overcoming the barriers associated with implementing a system 
effectively.

 4.2 Introduction  
The sport of swimming began its Olympic journey in 1896 (Hill et al., 2021)  and was 
most recently featured at the 2020  Olympic Games where a record total of thirty -seven 
events were contested. Despite recreational swimming being categorised as suitable for 
all ages and genders (Trinidad et al., 2021) , competitive swimming at the elite level has 
a well -established risk of i njury (Wanivenhaus et al.  2012; Feijen, Tate, Kuppens, Claes, 
et al.  2020; Barry et al.  2021; Trinidad et al.  2021; Hill et al.  2022) . A competitive 
swimming seaso n typically involves large training demands that can be highly repetitive 
and is a year -round process. (Hill et al., 2015) . Recently, an updated review of the 
epidemiology of swimming injuries described the incidence of injury (2.6 -3.0 injuries per 
1000 hours of exposure) as “relatively low risk” compared with other upper limb sports 
(Trinidad et al., 2021) . Overuse, non -contact injuries (Boltz et al., 2021)  are most 
prevalent in swimming, with a significantly higher incidence of injury in training 
compared to competition (Soligard et al., 2017) . Injuries in the sport are often non -time 
loss (Boltz et al., 2021)  or time -loss with low absence rates from training (Prien et al., 
2017) . The shoulder is most frequently injured followed by the knee and lower back 
(Wanivenhaus et al., 2012) . Injury burden, including the subsequent inconsistent training 
period and impacted performance, can have a significant influence on a competitive  
swimmer’s career (Mitchell et al., 2021) . Many swimmers train and compete with 
persistent health problems (Prien et al., 2017)  and often use medication as a form of pain 
relief (Hibberd and Myers 2013 ; Tessaro et al.  2017) . Chronic pain in this population , 
therefore , can often lead to disability or retirement from the sport (Ristolainen et al., 2009; 
Tate et al., 2012; Trinidad et al., 2021) .  
Injury surveillance in sport provides critical information on th e injury prevention 
practices needed to reduce the overall burden of injuries and, subsequently, improve 
performance (Tabben et al., 2020) . Injury prevention practices are a key aspect of a swim 
programme and are underpinned by a clear understanding of the associated risk factors 
(Johnson et al. , 2003)  and high -quality epidemiological data (Ekegren et al., 2014) . The 
development of a successful injury prevention programme is dependent  on reliable, valid, 
consistent and population -representative injury surveillance data (Ekegren et al., 2014) . 
Consistent and valid injury surveillance practices allow for the comparison of injury 
burden from season to season and can determine the effectiveness of an injury prevention 
intervention (Tabben et al., 2020) . Gender, previous injury history, movement 
biomechanics, musculoskeletal deficits and training load have been identified as risk 
72 
 factors in a variety of swimming populations (youth, adult, club, varsity, elite, 
international,  masters) through injury surveillance (Johnson et al.  2003; Abgarov et al.  
2012; Tate et al.  2012; Wanivenhaus et al.  2012; Harrington et al.  2014; Hill et al.  2015; 
Feijen, Tate, Kuppens, Claes, et al.  2020; Barry et al.  2021; Trinidad et al.  2021) . 
However, it has been  noted that the systematic collection of injury data is f ar from 
widespread outside of professional sport (Ekegren et al., 2016) .  
In 2016, a consensus statement on the methodology of injury and illness surveillance in 
aquatic sports was published by the Fédération Internationale de Natation (FINA) 
(Mountjoy et al., 2016) . The objective of the consensus statement was to develop an 
injury and illness surveillance protocol that provided clear aquatic -specific definitions for 
the terminology and metrics used in aquatic injury and illness surveillance (Mountjoy et 
al., 2016) . This was then followed by the International Olympic Committee (I OC) 
Consensus Statement, which sought to improve the consistency in data collection injury 
definitions and research reporting (Bahr et al., 2020) .  Despite the publication of both 
consensus statements, substantial methodological and reporting gaps remain in recently 
published injury surveillance research (Trinidad et al., 2021) .  A similar finding was 
echoed by Barry et al., (2021), who highlighted methodological inconsistencies in 
training load monitoring in competitive swimming through a systematic review of the 
published literature. However, in a subsequent publication, the same authors discovered, 
through an international survey of training load monitoring practices in competitive 
swimming environments, that the training load monitoring consensus guidelines 
(Soligard et al., 2016; Bourdon et al., 2017)  were being followed at the practitioner level 
(Barry et al., 2022a) . The inconsistent findings between the systematic review and the 
survey investigation highlighted a research -practice gap within training load monitoring 
literature in competitive swimming. To this end, it is imperative to investigate the injury 
surveillance practices being implemented in pract ical competitive swimming 
environments and discover if a similar research -practice gap exists. This investigation can 
also provide insight which may refine future injury surveillance guidelines in competitive 
swimming environments. Therefore, this study ai med to identify the injury surveillance 
practices being used in competitive swimming environments, along with the nature of the 
data collected and the injury definitions being used. In addition, the perceived 
effectiveness of injury surveillance was invest igated. Finally, this study examined barriers 
to injury surveillance.  
73 
 4.3 Methods  
4.3.1 Experimental Approach to the Problem  
A cross -sectional survey was designed to investigate the injury surveillance procedures 
and practices in competitive swimming. Competitive sw imming was defined within the 
survey as, “competitive swimming, where the primary purpose of the sport is competitive 
performance, not participation”, while injury surveillance was defined as, “the method of 
habitually collecting data relating to the occur rence of an injury and the risk factors 
associated with it”. An open, thirty -seven -question survey was self -administered through 
an online platform (Qualtrics.com). The survey included open and closed questions, and 
used branch, display,  and skip logic fun ctions to tailor the content depending on the 
specific responses.  The reporting of the survey is in line with the Checklist for Reporting 
of Internet Surveys (CHERRIES) (Eysen bach , 2004) . A copy of the survey is available 
online ( presented in appendix 4.1 ), along with the CHERRIES checklist ( appendix 4.2 ).  
4.3.2 Participants  
The survey was initially circulated globally to practitioners within swimming National 
Governing Bodies (N GBs) from Ireland, Great Britain, Spain, Australia,  and New 
Zealand and subsequently to a number of coaching associations (International Swim 
Coaches Association, World Coaches Swimming Association, UK Strength and 
Conditioning Association) in order to inc rease participant recruitment. Practitioners were 
initially identified through NGB websites or professional contacts. In addition, coaches,  
and practitioners from the NGBs were asked to circulate the survey to relevant contacts 
within their swimming commun ity to generate a snowball sample. It was requested that 
the individual who had the primary responsibility for injury surveillance within their 
swim programme complete the survey. Ethical approval was granted by the University’s 
Ethics Committee ( 2019_10_0 9_EHS ). Participant information sheets (including a 
GDPR statement)  (appendix 3.3)  were circulated with the questionnaire and each 
participant provided informed consent before participation in the research.  A total of 
twenty -two responses were collected.  
4.3.3 Procedures  
The online survey was circulated primarily by email, but also through social media 
platforms (LinkedIn, Twitter) to maximise the survey’s visibility. The aims, objectives 
and duration of the survey were included with each email, along with a part icipant 
74 
 information sheet. Data were collected from March to July 2020. Data gathered were 
identified using a code number, unnecessary personal details were not recorded or used 
in any part of this study and all data were stored using password -protection/e ncryption. 
Unique responses were identified using the IP address of the participant. IP addresses 
were crosschecked for duplications in Microsoft Excel during analysis and not used if 
found to be a replication. No duplications were found. The survey was de signed to allow 
participants to review questions and change answers throughout the survey if needed. The 
survey consisted of five sections: (1) informed consent; (2) demographics; (3) injury 
surveillance practices; (4) injury surveillance effectiveness; and (5) barriers to injury 
surveillance. The survey was pilot tested, refined and redrafted through a three -stage 
process. Stage one involved disc ussing the optimal survey question flow to reduce 
respondent burden. It also involved improving question phrasing to ensure respondents 
interpreted the questions correctly and were not influenced by the order of the questions. 
Stage two included testing th e survey with two academics with a background in injury 
surveillance research. Modifications of the survey in line with these consultations came 
in the form of improved technical terminology, further clarity on the phrasing of the 
questions and removal of irrelevant questions. The final stage involved a pilot test and 
trial analysis with two multi -sport high -performance support staff who regularly use 
injury surveillance in a practical setting. Pilot testing, outside of the academic sphere 
ensured the admin istration technique (email) was appropriate and that the terminology 
used transferred to the target population. Pilot testing, outside of the academic sphere 
ensured the administration technique (email) was appropriate and that the terminology 
used transfe rred to the target population. Post pilot testing, an individual debrief was 
conducted and highlighted areas of the survey that may have been problematic for the 
user (skipped questions, questions answered incorrectly or misunderstood). The 
individual debr ief led to the re -ordering of questions and additional clarity of terms used 
such as “professional accreditation” and “questionnaires”. The addition of contextual 
examples and set definitions where also added to terms including “incidence”, “severity”, 
“injury/illness burden”.  
4.3.4 Statistical Analyses  
Collated data were analysed using frequency analysis within Microsoft Excel. Absolute 
frequencies were predominantly used to report the data. Where data were qualitative, 
thematic analysis techniques from Braun et al., (2016) were employed. The thematic 
analysis employed a six -step process, including data familiarisation, coding, theme 
75 
 selection, refining themes, defining themes and finalising the report (Braun et al., 2016) . 
Line by line coding was applied to the open -ended questions by one author (LB). Themes 
were then developed from these codes by two authors (LB, KM). Representative 
quotations were then extracted, agreed by both authors,  and presented for each theme.  
4.4 Results  
4.4.1 Demographics  
A total of 22 responses were collected. A range of professionals (swim coach (n=9), 
physiotherapist (n=9), strength and conditioning (S&C) coach (n=3), athlete health lead 
(n=1) responded to the survey as the  primary staff member responsible for injury 
surveillance practices. Responders had either a bachelor’s  degree (n=8), master s degree 
(n=12) or PhD (n=2), and many (n=17) had a complementary discipline -specific 
qualification ( e.g., UK Strength and Conditio ning Association, Level two/three Swim 
Coaching Accreditation, CORU  (Irish Health and Social Care Regulator)  Registration). 
Responders often (n=12) worked with swim squads containing multiple performance 
levels (international n=17, national n=12, club n=10 ), with group sizes ranging from 5 to 
350 athletes.  
4.4.2 Injury Surveillance Practices  
A total of 15 responders acknowledged using injury surveillance practices, with the 
remaining seven citing limited time (n=4), lack of sufficient funding (n=2) and/or a lack 
of compliance from athletes (n=1) as being the key barriers that prevented them from 
employing injury surveillance practices. Responders highlighted the primary goals of 
injury surveillance within their programme were, “to keep a record for insurance 
purpo ses” (n=7), “to analyse in relation to other training factors” (n=5), “to inform 
appropriate athlete training prescription” (n=4) and/or “to highlight trends in injury 
occurrence” (n=2).  
When asked about the detail of their injury surveillance practices, responders noted that 
either the FINA (n=6) (Mountjoy et al.  2016)  or IOC (n=6) (Soligard et al.  2017)  
definition for injury was predominantly used, with one responder using the Australian 
Institute of Sport ( AIS) definition (2014). One responder used a combination of both the 
IOC and FINA definitions and one relied on a custom definition which noted an injury 
had occurred if it related to any modification of swim training. The majority of responders 
(n=14) not ed that they sub -categorised injuries, with all responders gathering additional 
76 
 injury or athlete specific detail during the recording process. The Table 4-1 below 
illustrates the information gathered.

 Primarily, injuries were recorded by a physiotherapist (n=6), swim coach (n=3), sports 
therapist (n=2), S&C coach (n=2), sports scientist (n=1) or by the athlete (n=1). In most 
cases (n=12), injury diagnosis was confirmed by a doctor or physiotherapist before it was 
recorded and s pecific software (n=6) or a spreadsheet (n=5) was used to store the 
information. Where an injury classification system was used (n=4), the Orchard Sports 
Injury  and Illness  Classification System (OSI ICS) was employed. However, a large 
portion of responders  (n=10) used no formal classification system (one responder was 
unsure of the system used). All but one responder highlighted recording additional 
training or athlete data in conjunction with their injury data  as presented in Figure 4-1.

Once data were collected, eight of the responders performed further analysis. Where 
further analysis was performed, injury prevalence (proportion of athletes affected by a 
specific condition at a defined period) (n=8), injury incidence (number of new 
occur rences of an injury in relation to the number of athletes at risk during a given period) 
(n=6), injury per training exposure (number of injuries recorded per training hours) (n=5) 
and injuries related to primary swimming stroke/distance (n=5) were most com monly 
used.

(n=1).  
Out of the remaining 15 responders who did employ injury surveillance  practices, 11 
acknowledged having barriers associated with conducting an effective injury surveillance 
system. Five overall themes were identified, with three of them being similar to those 
who did not employ injury surveillance practices (a lack of fundi ng, time and 
compliance). In addition to these, poor communication,  and a lack of engagement from 
the whole multidisciplinary team (MDT) were seen as significant barriers to conducting 
an effective injury surveillance system and are outlined with represent ative quotations in

 4.5 Discussion  
The objective of this study was to identify the injury surveillance practices being used in 
competitive swimming environments, along with the nature of the data collected and the 
injury definitions being used. The perceived effectiveness of the ability of injury 
surveillance to highlight risk factors of injury, injury trends, informing injury prevention 
strategies and reducing the overall occurrence of injury was investigated. Finally, this 
study also examined barriers to injury surveillance.  
4.5.1 Injury Survei llance in Competitive Swimming  
A key finding of this study was that 68 .2% of responders employed injury surveillance 
practices within their swim programme. This number is lower than that of both amateur 
rugby clubs (91%) and schools rugby teams (86%), that  did employ injury surveillance 
practices (Yeomans et al., 2018; Leahy et al., 2020) . It is also lower than other forms of 
monitoring (training load) commonly used in competitive -level swim programmes 
(83.9%) (Barry et al., 2022a) . Injury surveillance is the first stage within the Translating 
Research into Injury Prevention Practice (TRIPP) framework and is highlighted as a key 
stage to inform all other aspects of the injury prevention paradigm (Finch  2006) . This 
discrepancy in uptake between swimming and rugby may be due to the higher risk of 
injury in a sport like rugby (King et al., 2019; Leahy et al., 2019)  where the demand for 
systematic injury surveillance in contact sp orts may be higher than in non -contact sports. 
This may also be related to the nature of injuries sustained in swimming, which could be 
deemed as manageable. The majority of swimming -related injuries are non -time loss 
(Powell and Dompier 2004)  and may have a gradual onset (repetitive) (Trinidad et al., 
2021) . This often leads to swimmers training and competing with symptoms of inj ury, as 
outlined by Mountjoy et al., (2015), who reported that 70% of athletes attending the 15th 
FINA World Championships had symptoms of injury or illness in the weeks preceding 
and during the competition (Mountjoy et al., 2015) . Despite these swimmers being 
compromised, they participated in training and competition but stated their performance 
was affected (Mountjoy et al., 2015) . Swimming is a full -body sport, therefore specific 
modifications can be made to adapt the training programme to maintain a level of 
consistent training stim ulus. In the event of non -time loss injury, many adaptations in the 
form of reduced training load, alteration of swimming biomechanics and the use of 
kickboards or pull -buoys can be introduced. The ability to manage a high proportion of 
injuries, while mai ntaining a full training programme in this manner may underestimate 
83 
 the burden of injuries in a swim programme. This may reduce the perceived need for 
injury surveillance in the sport of swimming, as demonstrated by the proportion of 
responders using injur y surveillance in this study. However, an increased percentage 
uptake of injury surveillance practices in competitive swimming would lead to the 
improved design of injury prevention strategies as outlined in the TRIPP framework 
(Finch 2006) .    
4.5.2 Injury Definition  
The injury definition used within an injury surveillance system can have a large impact 
on the reported outcomes (Bahr 2009; Tabben et al. , 2020) , while the variability of 
definitions used across injury surveillance can limit the ability to compare outcomes 
(Bahr et al., 2020) . A key goal of this study was to discover if the methodological 
inconsistencies highlighted in research also exist in a practical setting. The findings of the 
current study showed that the majority of responders  used either the FINA (Mountjoy et 
al., 2016)  or IOC (Soligard et al. , 2017)  definition of injury. Additionally, one responder 
used the 2014 AIS injury definition, one responder used a combination of both the IOC 
and FINA definitions and one relied on a custom d efinition. Previous epidemiological 
research has shown that methodological variation between studies limits the 
transferability of the findings (Trinidad et al., 2021) . The call for a standardised injury 
definition to be used in injury surveillance is, without question, an essential requirement 
in a research context. Our findings show that the methodo logical inconsistencies seen 
previously are also present in the practical environment.  However, the responders within 
this study highlighted that their primary goals of injury surveillance were, “to keep a 
record for insurance purposes”, “to analyse in re lation to other training factors”, “to 
inform appropriate athlete training prescription” and/or “to highlight trends in injury 
occurrence”. The goal, “research purposes” was selected as a tertiary goal by only one 
responder. As research is not a goal in th ese environments, the research -practice gap may 
not be as significant as initially thought. In the practical environment (where research is 
not the goal), the injury definition needs to be consistent longitudinally to allow the injury 
surveillance outcomes  to be compared season on season and between co -operating 
training centres/athletes. Long -term consistency in the selected injury definition will aid 
in the ability to evaluate the effectiveness of injury prevention strategies over subsequent 
seasons. If t he injury definition were to change the data would not provide a reliable 
picture of the effectiveness of the interventions employed (Tabben et al., 2020) .  
Similarly, a practitioner would need to be aware of t he definition they are using to select 
84 
 an appropriate epidemiological study to compare their results to (Meeuwisse and Love 
1997) .  
The definition selected by a practitioner must also be sport -specific and capture all the 
relevant issues affecting that programme. In a sport like swimming where non -time loss 
injuries are dominant, a time -loss injury definition would severely underestima te the true 
injury burden (Bahr 2009) . All 15 respon ders who participated in injury surveillance 
employed an injury definition that would capture non -time loss injuries adequately. 
However, the use of the IOC definition (selected by six responders), which includes the 
need for an injury or complaint to rece ive medical attention for it to be deemed a 
recordable event, may not be suitable. Even though a medical attention -based definition 
is preferred to the traditional time loss (Bahr , 2009; Bahr et al., 2020)  as it captures a 
wider array of injuries and improves the quality control of recording, it still has its 
challenges (Toohey and Drew 2020) . The main limitation is the need for consistent and 
adequate access to a clinician who is briefed on the injury surveillance protocols. A 
suitable clinician may not always be available to assess an injury, particularly at all p ool 
and gym training sessions, during international camps or competitions.  
The findings of this study showed the role of recording the injuries primarily rested with 
the physiotherapist; however, the responsibility also fell on the swim coach, sports 
therapist, S&C coach,  or the athlete. The World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines 
for injury surveillance (World Health Organization 2001)  state that ideally, a member of 
the medical staf f treating the injury should complete the injury surveillance record. 
However, they do acknowledge that administrative duties can add an unnecessary burden 
to medical staff and therefore a trained third party may also fulfil the role. This was 
deemed to be  the case with many of our responders where a variety of staff recorded the 
data, but the majority had the injury diagnosis confirmed by a doctor or physiotherapist 
before being recorded. It is important to note that the FINA guidelines have broadened 
the scope of who can assess a medical attention injury. The guidelines state that a 
qualified clinician, including but not limited to a physician, physiotherapist, nurse or a 
physician assistant can be involved in the health care (not related to performance 
enhancement) of an athlete (Mountjoy et al., 2016) . This better suits an applied 
environment where medical staff can often be contracted or part -time.  
85 
 4.5.3 Method of Data Collection  
The protocols and procedures of data collection have been shown to influence the  
outcome of sports injury surveillance in research (Bahr et al., 2020) . The findings of this 
study showed that 13 responders used some form of electronic method to collect the data, 
whilst a relatively low number of responders used a formal injury classification system. 
The means of logging the information by use of pen and paper, electronica lly or online 
all have their merits and can be selected based on the specific context of the injury 
surveillance system, resources, level of implementation and objectives (Bahr et al., 2020) . 
This point, however, is directly linked to the recommendation that a location, type and 
diagnosis of injury should be recorded (Mountjoy et al., 2016) , allowing the grouping of 
data into higher -order classifications making reporting the data easier (Bahr et al., 2020) . 
The recommended use of sport -specific classification coding systems (e.g., Sports 
Medicine Diagnostic Coding System (SMDCS), OSI ICS, etc.) wo uld typically require an 
electronic database to ensure the effective and easy use of the system. However, in a less 
well-resourced setting, the use of pen and paper would suffice with the FINA consensus 
statement offering an alternative reporting method wi th less detailed options (Mountjoy 
et al., 2016) .  
The FINA consensus guidelines also provide detail on additional injury data which should 
be recorded. This additional detail allows the comprehensive classification of injuries into 
reoccurrences, re -injuries,  and exacerbations. Many additional data were collected by our 
responders during the recording process. The most frequent sub -categorisation of injury 
was an “overuse injury”. This is not a surprising result based on the frequent  publication 
of epidemiological data highlighting that an overuse style injury is most common in 
swimming (Wanivenhaus et al., 2012) . Despite the FINA guidelines presenting a user 
definition for sub -categorising injuries as either overuse or traumatic, they note that 
defining injuries u sing one or the other can be challenging. The categorisation of injuries 
according to their acute or repetitive nature and sub -categorising by sudden or gradual 
onset would provide more nuanced detail (Bahr et al., 2020) . The addition of further detail 
according to the level of contact (direct, indirect and non -contact) would also give more 
context to the data. All responders in this study noted that they recorded additional details 
including date of injury and body location. The majority of responders collected 
mechanisms of injury, the impact of injury and injury diagnosis/type. The survey d id not 
explore the categorisation of injury by the level of contact.  
86 
 4.5.4 Data Analysis  
In sport, the era of collecting “big data” is now common and often involves routinely 
collecting biodata or training metrics, storing it longitudinally but not necessarily using it 
acutely (Arnold and Sade 2017; Osborne and Cunningham 2017) . This was deemed to be 
the case in this study where only half  of the responders conducted further analysis on the 
data after collection and the majority of responders highlighted the primary reason for 
recording the data was for insurance purposes (creating a medical record of the injury, 
documentation for medical c osts etc.).  This gives the impression that the data are being 
collected and stored, lest it is needed. Where further analysis was conducted, injury 
prevalence, injury incidence, injury per training exposure and injuries related to stroke or 
event were mos tly employed. This is in keeping with the FINA consensus statement 
where the method of assessing exposure is outlined as either the calculation of incidence 
or prevalence and/or reported by stroke type or event distance (Mountjoy et al., 2016) . 
The use of prevalence is the preferred method of expressing risk in a sport like swimming 
where chronic or gradual onset conditions are more frequent. (Bahr et al., 2020) . In this 
study, injury prevalence was the most frequently used method of expressing risk, closely 
followed by injury incidence.  
In a non -academic/ non-research setting, th e basic reporting of incidence and prevalence 
may suffice, particularly when disseminating the information to coaches and athletes. As 
the objectives of the injury surveillance system are elevated to investigate 
epidemiological trends more comprehensively,  the level of detail would need to increase 
to reflect the outcome. Additional information to support the injury surveillance data were 
gathered by almost all the responders, highlighting its perceived importance. Such  
information included musculoskeletal screening, injury history, training load and 
wellness data. Neither the FINA nor IOC consensus statements include in -depth 
guidelines regarding the integration or implementation of athlete training load, wellness 
or biomechanical monitoring in parallel to the primary injury surveillance system. In a 
research context, training load or wellness monitoring are often tracked alongside injury 
surveillance (Eckard et al., 2018)  and this is clearly common practice in a prac tical 
environment as found in the current study. The publication of guidelines on how to best 
integrate multiple monitoring systems in a practical environment may not only improve 
the standard of injury surveillance findings but also potentially improve th e accuracy of 
injury prevention interventions.  
87 
 4.5.5 Goals of Injury Surveillance  
Responders recorded  that one of the primary goals of their injury surveillance was “to 
highlight trends in injury occurrence” and noted that they found injury surveillance to be 
very effective for this purpose. This finding is reinforced by a comprehensive study 
published in 2019 which investigated injury occurrence in the Japanese national swim 
programme over 15 years (Matsuura et al., 2019) . The study highlighted an increase in 
knee joint injuries in the middle of the project which coincided with a change in start 
block dimensions (globally) leading to a potential increase in joint load. Longitudinal 
injur y surveillance projects like Matsuura et al., (2019) can provide data to inform injury 
prevention interventions designed and employed in the practical environment .  
Responders also highlighted that injury surveillance was very effective at informing 
injury  prevention practices and moderately effective at highlighting risk factors 
associated with injury. This is also highlighted by Matsuura et al., (2019) where disc 
degeneration and spinal cramps of the lumbar region were identified as being common 
issues am ongst Japanese swimmers. Once the issue was identified, a “Lumbar Injury 
Prevention” project was designed and implemented, resulting in a decrease in lumbar 
injury incidence during the intervention period. They identified key risk factors for injury 
during  the surveillance period which included female gender, older age and increased 
years of swimming, and have targeted intervention programmes at young female 
swimmers to mitigate future injury in this population (Matsuura et al., 2019) .  
4.5.6 Barriers to Injury Surveillance  
The successful implementation and effective use of an injury surveillance system are 
reliant on maintaining high standards in all aspects of the data collection and analysis 
procedures (Ekegren et al., 2014) . In a sports setting where injury surveillance is not 
necessarily mandatory, upholding such high standards can be challenging (Ekegren et al., 
2014) . The barriers to injury surveillance in a practical swimming environment were 
identified during this study. A third of responders did not employ injury surveillance 
practices in their environment largely due to limited time, funding,  and compliance. 
Simil arly, two -thirds of responders who did employ injury surveillance practices also 
acknowledged that limited time, funding,  and compliance were barriers they experienced. 
This finding is similar to that within amateur rugby where player adherence, time 
commi tments, available medical professionals and system technical issues were cited as 
88 
 the key barrier to implementing injury surveillance at the amateur level of the sport 
(Yeomans et al., 2019) .  
Poor co mmunication amongst, and a lack of engagement from, the whole MDT were also 
cited as key factors in conducting an effective injury surveillance system by responders. 
Responders noted that poor communication and adherence at the coaches/practitioner 
level w as a challenge. In the primary training venue, poor communication amongst 
“home” staff was a barrier. This was also seen in non -centralised training centres or 
during competitions or camps where external coaches or practitioners may be employed.  
Poor comm unication amongst the MDT was also key findings in elite football across an 
eighteen year UEFA Club Injury Study (ECIS) (Ekstrand et al., 2019) . The study found 
that levels of internal communication within an MDT was associated with injury rate and 
player availability. More specifically, poor communication quality betwe en the head 
coach and the medical staff resulted in 6 -7% lower player availability and 50% higher 
injury burden compared with teams with moderate to high communication quality. A 
similar study investigated the  role of the head coach further and found that  coaches with 
a democratic leadership style, and who supported and encouraged staff development were 
linked to a lower severe injury rate. (Ekstrand et al., 2018) . This investigation into football 
and the similar themes found within this study highlight the importance of quality multi -
disciplinary communication within the injury surveillance/prevention paradigm (Ghrairi 
et al., 2019) . Based on this finding, it would be practical to suggest improved education 
on the importance of injury surveillance for all staff within the swimming programme 
(Ekegren et al., 2014) . It may also be pertinent to present injury prevention strategies to 
a head coach in the guise of performance improveme nt. The relationship between injury 
burden and a team’s success has been documented in elite football where athlete 
availability was associated with league rankings (Hägglund et al., 2013) . In an individual 
sport context,  a loss of training time due to injury was shown to be a determining factor 
in the obtainment of an athlete’s performance goals in athletics (Raysmith and Drew 
2016) . Studies of this nature may help educate and engage technical staff in the injury 
surveillance and prevention process.  
4.6 Limitations  
The survey was circulated globally through NGBs, coaching associations and social 
media outlets. This form of distribution limited the ability to track non -respondents and 
subsequently the response rate (as defined by (Phillips et al.  2017) ) could not be 
89 
 calculated or presented. This also limits the ability to confirm the degree of international 
representation of the data. Additionally, as with all survey -based research, the presence 
of selection and response bias may have been present in this study. The authors opened 
the survey up to multiple avenues of distribution; however, it is likely that those who 
employ injury surveillance were m ore likely to engage with the survey than those that do 
not. Therefore, this may have inflated the data favourably towards those who do employ 
injury surveillance in their swim programme. The survey was also largely distributed 
through NGB channels, with a  high proportion of responders working with international 
level athletes. The survey data may be more reflective of the upper  echelons of the sport 
with higher levels of resources to conduct injury surveillance. This may result in the data 
being less repre sentative of the global landscape of injury surveillance in competitive 
swimming, particularly within grass -roots swim programmes. An additional limitation 
was omitt ing a survey question related to the categorisation of injuries by level of contact. 
As thi s is a recommendation of the FINA and IOC consensus statements it could have 
provided valuable detail but was not included in the survey. This is something that can be 
addressed in future research.  
4.7 Practical Application  
The implementation of injury surveillance in a sporting context is related to the objectives 
of the system, the level of those under surveillance and the resources available. Where 
the injury surveillance outcomes are to be translated into research, it is imperative that 
strict use of the consensus guidelines is employed. The findings of this study showed that 
while many practical environments are collecting sufficient data (injury location, type,  
and severity) , the inconsistent use of injury definition and  low engagement of 
classification coding systems limits the transferability or comparison of the findings.  
However, where research is not the objective, as discovered in the majority of cases, the 
requirement is to have a consistent and sport -specific inj ury definition longitudinally 
within the swim programme. In a sport like swimming where non -time loss injuries are 
dominant, a time -loss injury definition would severely underestimate the true injury 
burden (Bahr 2009) . To this end, the use of either the FINA or IOC injury definitions is 
appropriate. Howeve r, the inclusion of “medical attention” (as in the IOC definition) 
within the definition should only be considered when a consistent, trained medical 
professional is available to all aspects of the programme.  
90 
 Similarly, the method of data collection is al so resource -driven. Ideally, an electronic 
system could be used to reduce the time burden of injury surveillance and to improve the 
level of detail gathered. Preferably, a classification system would be employed with the 
date of injury, body location, mech anisms of injury, the impact of injury and injury 
diagnosis/type all being recorded. The categorisation of injuries according to their acute 
or repetitive nature and sub -categorising by sudden or gradual onset would provide more 
nuanced detail (Bahr et al., 2020) , particularly in a repetitive sport like swimming. The 
collection of previous in jury history and additional training load data were deemed to be 
very influential concerning preventing injury, potentially highlighting the need for it to 
be collected in parallel with the injury surveillance system.  
4.8 Conclusion  
Sixty-eight percent  of responders employed injury surveillance practices within their 
swim programme with 53% of those performed further analysis on the data once it was 
collected. Injury surveillance is the first step in the TRIPP framework and the 
implementa tion of such a system requires the balance of following the sound principles 
outlined in consensus statements and overcoming the barriers associated with an injury 
surveillance system. The loftier the injury surveillance system objectives the more the 
guidelines need to be followed to maintain strict protocols and uphold the accuracy of the 
data. However, in a practical setting, it may be more prudent to tackle the “how” of 
implementing a system including roles and responsibilities of the MDT, the 
communica tion pathways, staff engagement and education on the necessities and benefits 
of injury surveillance. Those who do not partake in injury surveillance cite limited time, 
resources,  and funding as key barriers. The first step in increasing the uptake of inju ry 
surveillance in a swimming environment requires that these intertwined issues are 
addressed together. Injury surveillance models, where the implementation and integration 
are driven by the governing body, can be very successful in easing these barriers by 
providing tailor -made systems to domestic clubs and providing incentives for their 
participation (Yeomans et al., 2019) . Additionally, providing staff education (Ekegren et 
al., 2014)  as to the benefits of injury surveillance has been shown to improve coach 
engagement, particularly where the benefits are outlined with improvements to 
performance outcomes.

A common th read on the need for  a consistent methodological approach to the collection 
of both training load and injury/illness surveillance data has been present from Chapter 
one through to Chapter four. Each chapter has identified that the training load and 
injury/illness monitoring p rocess would be made more robust and effective by being 
informed by the most recent FINA and IOC consensus statements. Chapter two also 
highlighted the need for publi shed research  to reflect best practice as regards the 
collection of both internal and external training loads . Similarly, Chapter three and four 
provided valuable insight into the practices of coaches and practitioners working in 
competitive  swimming, including the metrics being collected and the barriers whi ch are 
needed to be considered in the design and implementation of such a system. Chapter five 
has collated the findings and recommendations from the previous chapters . The chapter 
outlines the design of a training load monitoring system which employs the use of internal 
and external training load metrics in the form of swim volume (km) and sRPE -TL. The 
chapter also presents the design of a consensus statement led injury /illness surveillance 
system . The procedures involved in the implementation of the syste m are described in 
detail, while the evaluation of the system as per recommendations from the World Health 
Organisation is also presented .

 5.1 Abstract  
Introduction:  Quality injury/illness surveillance is a crucial aspect of injury/illness 
prevention, whilst training load pre scription has been considered as an influencing 
factor. The ability to monitor training load in parallel with injury/illness surveillance 
may provide a clearer  understanding of the aetiology and risk factors associated with  
injury /illness.  
Aims:  To design and evaluate an integrated training load monitoring and injury/illness 
surveillance system in a competitive swimming environment.  
Methods:  Employing a descriptive/mixed methods approach a training load monitoring 
and injury/illness surveillance system was designed, implemented,  and evaluated. System 
satisfaction, usefulness and burden were evaluated , while b arriers to the implementation 
and effectiveness of the system were explored.  
Results:  Fourteen competitive athletes and seven coaches/medical data collectors 
participated in the evaluation process. Most athletes were ‘extremely’ or ‘very’ satisfied 
with the data collection process and als o found it ‘extremely’ or ‘very’ useful in the 
training centre environment. All practitioners were ‘extremely satisfied with the system 
and found it to be either ‘ extremely’ or ‘very’ useful  in their role. Process constraints  and 
data access and control  were significant themes related to the athletes, while practitioners 
highlighted communication and cooperation amongst stakeholders , layering context to 
the data, maintaining data integrity  and the coach’s influence in the monitoring process  
as being importa nt to the monitoring/surveillance process.  
Conclusions: Training load monitoring and injury/illness surveillance are necessary to 
elevate the standard of prospective injury/illness prevention research. Integrated systems 
should be designed in line with key consensus statements, while also being implemented 
in a way that counteracts the challenges within the real -world training environment.

 5.2 Introduction  
A competitive swimming season is a year -round process where  training stimuli and 
recovery are carefully intertwined to allow the athlete to push limits of performance whilst 
avoiding overtraining, injury or detraining (Hellard et al., 2019) . Swimming typically 
involves an excess of 1000 hrs of training per year, incorporating 400 -800 sessions 
(Tønnessen et al., 2014) , culminating in peak performance opportunities (Hellard et al., 
2019) . These significant demands lead to a higher incidence of injury during training than 
in competition (Soligard et al., 2017)  and may result in swimmers training and competing 
with persistent health problems (Prien et al., 2017) .  
Injury prevention in sport requires collaboration (Impellizzeri et al., 2020)  and a robust 
framework to act within (Finch 2006) . The Translating Research into Injury Prevention 
Practice (TRIPP) framework outlines the necessity of high -quality surveillance data 
combined with a clear u nderstanding of the aetiology and risk factors of injury (Finch 
2006) . Studies have found associations between muscular length (Harrington et al., 
2014) , core endurance (Tate et al., 2012)  and shoulder pain in division one female 
swimmers, while training loa d has also been found as a contributing factor in national -
level swimmers (Ristolainen et al., 2014) . FINA has published several studies exploring 
in-competition injuries and illnesses with many of these studies recommending out of 
competition prospective injury and illness surveillance (Mountjoy et al., 2010, 2015, 
2016; Engebretsen et al., 2013; Prien et al., 2017; Soligard et al., 2017) . Two studies have 
examined injury surveillance in national level (Matsuura et al., 2020)  and collegiate 
swimmers (Boltz et al., 2021) . Both studies, while robust in design, provide 
recommendations  which include more detailed athlete exposure data (i.e., type or 
intensity of training, distance swam, and cardiovascular/exertional indices) in parallel 
with their injury surveillance procedures (Matsuura et al., 2020; Boltz et al., 2021) . 
Monitoring risk factors such as training load, in parallel with the surveillance data, can 
give insights into the aetiology of injuries and support the translation of the information 
into actionable interventions.   
Training load can be defined as the cu mulative amount of stress placed on the athlete 
(Griffin et al., 2020b)  and can be divided into internal and external loads (Drew and Finch 
2016) . External loads quantify work while internal loads describe the response to that 
work (Drew and Finch 2016) . In swimming, distance, time or speed are habitually used 
to monitor the external  training load, with heart rate or session rate of perceived exertion 
95 
 (sRPE) typically used to monitor internal training load (Garcí a-Ramos et al., 2015; Barry 
et al., 2022a) . Additionally, subjective athlete markers of well -being are commonly 
tracked in swimming (Barry et al., 2022a)  as a method of monitoring psycho social stress 
in the athlete (Saw et al., 2017; Sinnott -O’Connor et al., 2018; Griffin et al., 2020b) . 
Monitoring objective and subjective metrics of this nature is essential to effective 
programme design (Impellizzeri et al., 2020)  and viewed as an influencing factor in the 
incidence of injury (Gabbett 2020) . Monitoring systems should be feasible and 
scientifically grounded (Griffin et al., 2020b) . Barriers such as stakeholder engagement, 
resource constraints and system functionality need to be considered (Barry et al., 2022a)  
while overcoming limited time, funding, compliance and poor staff communication are 
necessary for eff ective implementation (Yeomans et al., 2019; Barry et al., 2022b) . The 
World Health Organisation (WHO) injury surveillance guidelines also recommend that 
an end -user evaluation process should be conducted after at least six months of the system 
being operational (World Health Organization 2001) . The goal of the evaluation process 
is to assess the data collection process and end -user satisfaction, usefulness,  and burden. 
This will aid in the identification of system flaws and opportunities for developme nt and 
maintain system relevance within a dynamic environment (World Health Organization 
2001) .  
Quality injury/illness surveillance is a crucial aspect of injury/illness prevention, whi lst 
the monitoring of potential risk factors in parallel to the injury/illness surveillance period 
is also of critical importance. Despite much research investigating the relationship 
between injury/illness and training load, a causative relationship has y et to be identified 
(Barry et al., 2021) . Thus far, this lack of clarity may be down to methodological 
constraints in both the means of implementing the integrated system or expressing the 
injury/illness incidence relative to accurate training load measures (Matsuura et al., 2020; 
Barry et al., 2021; Boltz et al., 2021; Trinidad et al., 2021) . Therefore, the primary aim 
of this study was to describe the design and implementation of an integrated system 
running concurrently throughou t a competitive swim season. The secondary aim was to 
conduct an end -user evaluation of the integrated system and to make future 
recommendations regarding such systems.  
96 
 5.3 Methods  
5.3.1 Experimental Approach to the Problem  
The nature of the problem centred on the ability to design and implement an integrated 
training load and injury/illness surveillance system to be used within competitive 
swimming. The experimental approach aligned with procedures by Griffin et al., (2020b) . 
Step one consisted of exploring current trainin g load and injury surveillance practices 
which have previously been established (Barry et al., 2022a, 2022b) . Step two was to 
design and implement an integrated system. Step three was participant recruitment and 
familiarisation. Step four was implementing data collection, analysis,  and auditing 
practices. Step five was the end -user evaluation of the integrated system after one year of 
data collection.  
5.3.2 Design and Implementation  
The integrated system was built on the findings of stage one. It also engaged with the  
FINA  and/or Internation al Olympic Committee (IOC) consensus statements (Mountjoy 
et al., 2016; Bahr et al., 2020)  and guidance from Soligard et al., (2016)  and Schwellnus 
et al., (2016) . The integrated system was designed with two elements of data collection: 
1) athlete self -reported data and 2) practitioner -reported d ata. Athlete self -reported data 
were collected through the online application Kitman LabsTM (kitmanlabs.com ), which 
could be accessed through mobile phones. The practitioner data were inputted into a 
bespoke Microsoft Excel worksheet, designed in line with  the Orchard Sports Injury and 
Illness Classification System (OSIICS) (Orchard et al., 2020) . 
5.3.3 Athlete Self-Reported Data  
Athlete self -reported data were divided into two categories: 1) well -being data; and 2) 
training load data. All streams of data collected are outlined in  Figure 5-1. Subjective 
measures of well -being have been shown to respond acutely and chronically to training 
load and are recommended for inclusion alongside other objective monitoring practices 
(Saw et al., 2017) . In th is case, sRPE –TL and session volume in meters were monitored. 
Athletes rated their perceived exertion on the modified Borg scale (1 -10) (as adapted from 
the Borg CR10 scale (Borg 1998) ) after each session. They were also asked to record the 
session volume in meters and minutes where applicable and select the activity type ( e.g., 
swimming, S&C – strength, racing, S&C – conditioning). sRPE –TL was calculated by 
97 
 multiplying the sRPE by the duratio n of the activity, as outlined previously (Foster et al., 
2001; Wallace et al., 2008; Griffin et al., 2020b) .  
5.3.4 Practitioner Reported Data  
A nominated physiotherapist was assigned to each training venue as the medical data 
collector (MDC). Data consisted of any injury or illness sustained and were defined as 
per Bahr et al., (2020) . Injury and illness were subcategorised as medical attention or non -
medical attention and time -loss or non -time loss. Time -loss and medical attention are 
defined as per Mountjoy et al., (2016) . Injury/illness mode of onset was classified on a 
continuum consistent with Bahr et al., (2020) . Circumstances of injury wer e divided into 
training or competition (Mountjoy et al., 2016)  with a further classification as to the level 
of contact (direct, indirect, non -contact) (Bahr et al., 2020) . Illnesses were sub -
categorised as communicable or non -communicable (Mountjoy et al., 2016) . Subsequent, 
recurrent or exacerbation of injuries/illnesses were classified as described in Bahr et al., 
(2020) .  The severity of the injury/illness was recorded as the duration of time loss (Bahr 
et al., 2020) . Time loss was reported from the date of onset until the athlete was fully 
available for training and compet ition. Fully available was clarified as without 
modification of training prescription, modification of technique or deficits in performance 
directly related to the injury or illness. The OSIICS was employed to determine the 
location, type,  and diagnosis of  injury/illness.  
5.3.5 Participants  
Two of Swim Ireland's (the national governing body for swimming on the island of 
Ireland) National Training Centres were involved in the data collection; National Centre 
Dublin (NCD) and National Centre  Limerick (NCL). A total of 24 athletes trained within 
Swim Ireland’s National Centre programmes during the data collection period. These 
athletes are classified as World Class (n=1), Elite/International Level (n=11) and Highly 
Trained/National Level (n=12 ) (McKay et al., 2022) . These National Centres were 
identified to implement the integrated system and all 24 athletes were recruited. Athletes’ 
education (handbook) and familiarisation began 12 weeks before the start of the formal 
data collection period. The MDC in each centre w as provided with an education session 
and reference handbook on the procedures and definitions to be employed during the data 
collection period. Ethical approval was granted by the University’s Ethics Committee 
(2019_10_09_EHS ). All participants were provi ded with information sheets and 
informed consent forms prior to commencing the study (appendix 5.1).

5.3.6 Auditing Practices  
Auditing procedures included sending daily text reminders to athletes to input their data. 
Athlete data were manually cross -checked weekly to verify the presence or absence of 
data. Absent or suspicious data (excessively high/low) were highlighted, investi gated,  and 
rectified where needed. A biweekly group email was sent out to the MDCs to confirm the 
continuity and completeness of ongoing or resolved cases.  Integrated Monitoring System

 5.3.7 Evaluation  
In line with the WHO’s injury surveillance guidelines (World Health Organization 2001) , 
an end -user evaluation process should be conducted to identify flaws and opportunities 
for improvement. After the first season of implementation, an end -user evaluation was 
carried ou t. Survey reporting was conducted in line with the CHERRIES checklist 
(Eysenbach 2004)  (appendix 5.2) , while interviews and focus groups followed the 
COREQ checklist (Tong et al., 2007)  (appendix 5.3) . The surveys (administered via 
Qualtrics) were designed to evaluate aspects of the integrated system that athletes (N=24), 
coaches (N=4) and MDCs (N=3) were directly involved with, on a daily basis. Athletes 
and coaches evaluated the self -reported data collection process from their unique 
perspectives, while the MDCs evaluated the  practitioner -reported data collection 
processes. Athlete surveys were circulated at the end of the domestic competitive season 
and before the 2020 Tokyo Olympic/Paralympic Games. The survey was circulated 
through email to all participating athletes and re mained open for a two -week period. 
MDC/coaches surveys were followed up with semi -structured online focus group sessions 
(MDCs) or semi -structured interviews (coaches). Additional reporting details of the 
survey, interview and focus group design, circulati on and analysis can be found in 
appendix 5.4 . Interview/focus group scripts and prompts can be found in appendix 5.5. 
Copy of end -user evaluation surveys can be found in appendix 5.6.

5.4 Results  
5.4.1 Athlete Self-Reported Data  
In total, 14/24 athletes responded to the survey. The response rate was potentially affected 
by the close proximity to the end of the domestic competitive season. The majority of 
athletes were transitioning to their off -season, selected at hletes were travelling to Tokyo 
in preparation for the Olympics/Paralympics and 5 athletes had ceased training within the 
National Centres by the time the survey was circulated.  The sample consisted of 10 males Integrated Monitoring System Evaluation Process

 and 4 females, which is a representation of the athlete gender balance of the centralised 
swimming athlete population in Ireland. The majority of athletes noted that they were 
‘extremely’ or ‘very’ satisfied (n=11) with the overall data collection process. Athletes 
reported that the monitoring proce ss was ‘extremely’ or ‘very’ useful (n=12) or 
‘moderately useful’ (n=2) to the training centre. Furthermore, they found the monitoring 
process was ‘extremely’ or ‘very’ useful (n=8) or ‘moderately’ or ‘slightly’ useful (n=6) 
to themselves as athletes. All athletes noted that inputting well -being data were 
‘extremely’ or ‘very’ easy, with the majority echoing the same sentiment for sleep hours 
(n=13), physical complaint (n=11) and training load data (n=12). The remainder of 
responders noted that inputting sl eep hours, physical complaint and training load data was 
‘moderately’ or ‘slightly’ easy. Athletes were also asked how burdensome the process of 
inputting training load data were during competition periods, in comparison to the daily 
training environment. The majority of athletes agreed (n=11) that there was no difference 
between the two environments. However, the remaining responders noted that inputting 
training load in the daily training environment was ‘moderately’ burdensome in 
comparison with ‘moderat ely’, ‘very’ or ‘extremely’ burdensome in the competition 
environment. Athletes highlighted the measures they felt best represented their ability to 
train as planned were energy (n=8), followed by physical complaint (n=2), muscle 
soreness, sleep quality, s wim volume and willingness to train (all n=1).  
A thematic analysis was conducted on the open questions, with the higher -order themes 
of ‘data access/control’ and ‘process constraints’ featuring consistently amongst the 
responses.  
Athletes noted that “ we can’t see if we’ve filled something already ” (R1) or “ recalling if 
I have filled out every piece of detail as required ” (R5) were barriers related to their access 
and control of the system. Athletes highlighted solutions by noting, “ If you could see what 
forms you've filled out…….. If you made a mistake, you could delete the volume or a 
session yourself… ” (R1). The athlete’s ability to see and track their recorded information, 
be able to modify it and take ownership of its consistency and accuracy wou ld be of great 
benefit to the overall system.   
The logistics of the monitoring process also increased the burden on the athlete. Athletes 
noted several instances where the usability of the system was seen as a barrier; for 
example, “ the number of different  places to go in the app to fill out the data can be 
tedious .” (R5) or “ typing in data, clicking buttons works well but putting numbers in can 
101 
 be slow” (R13).  Athletes also suggested that the student -athlete and early morning culture 
of the sport heightene d the burden, “ the only issue is you have to do it in the early 
mornings when I’m half asleep ” (R3) and “ especially during college weeks, it can be hard 
to stay on top of data ” (R7). Finally, athletes proposed solutions to these issues through 
small adjust ments to the reporting process. For example, “ I would like the volume and 
RPE to be on the same page instead of having to go to different places within the app ” 
(R4) or “ Have a box for sleep hours during the day for nap times ” (R8).  
5.4.2 Practitioner Reported D ata 
Head coaches noted that their primary roles in the monitoring process ranged from 
decision making on the data provided, making data inferences, and information 
dissemination. Assistant coaches also noted decision making in relation to the data 
provided  was a primary aspect of their role, but included liaising with athletes for 
inputting data, analysing data or data cleaning. All coaches rated how satisfied they were 
with the integrated system with both head coaches noting ‘ extreme satisfaction’  and 
assistant coaches being either ‘somewhat’ or ‘moderately’ satisfied. Each coach also  rated 
the system as being ‘extremely useful’  or ‘very useful’  to them in their role and noted that 
analysing athlete’s data was either ‘slightly’  or ‘not at all’  burdensome. Coaches 
highlighted the measures they felt best represented the athletes’ ability to train as planned 
were sleep quality  (n=2) and sleep duratio n (n=2).  
MDCs unanimously stated the system was either ‘extremely’  or ‘somewhat’  good in 
terms of their overall satisfaction with the system. They also agreed that the system was 
gathering sufficient injury/illness surveillance information and was a ‘very  accurate’ 
representation of the actual injury and illness profile sustained over the season. The 
MDCs noted that the system was either ‘extremely’  or ‘somewhat’  good in terms of ease 
of use, time taken to record data, visual appeal,  and suitability of the  data fields.  
5.4.3 Focus Group and Interviews  
Four themes were identified from the analysis of the interviews with coaches and the 
focus group with the MDCs:  
1) Communication and co -operation amongst stakeholders.  
2) Layering context to the data.  
3) Maintaining data integrity.  
4) The coach’s influence in the monitoring  process.  
102 
 5.4.3.1  Communication and Cooperation Amongst Stakeholders  
This theme outlines key situations where the integrated system was a fundamental driver 
of multidirectional communication betw een the athlete, support staff and coaches. Firstly, 
participants described how the system provides a medium for the athlete to communicate 
indirectly with the coaching staff, particularly where they might find face -to-face 
communication difficult.  
“it cr eates that conversation rather than them having to come to us going. “Hey look, 
I've got a problem”. I think they find that quite difficult to communicate” ( R6) 
Meanwhile, it a lso improved the coaches’ ability to have targeted conversation with the 
athletes about their wellbeing:  
“I'm looking at…..if anyone got a niggle, has everybody slept well?....and all they do is 
allow, when we come out the office to say, Morning! Everythi ng OK? Oh yeah, just slept 
terrible but I’m fine” (R4)  
The system also provides opportunities for the coach to have more informed 
conversations with the wider multidisciplinary team, allowing them to highlight specific 
areas of concern and seek appropriate  interventions:  
“…communication across the staff in terms of how we as staff interact and then we can 
use that information to say, right? Well, there's obviously an issue here. Do we need to 
modify things…” (R5)  
5.4.3.2  Layering Context to the Data 
Many participa nts felt that while the primary action of collecting the raw information is 
useful, adding a layer of context to the data is necessary for optimum understanding and 
decision making. One such layer of context was ensuring the accuracy and integrity of 
the raw data before taking action:  
“(the system) gives you snippets of information, but it doesn't then lead to a knee jerk 
decision. It leads to a conversation, is everything okay?.... actually, I just pressed the 
wrong button” (R4)  
Participants also noted th at they would cross -check their understanding of the data with 
the athlete to ensure their corresponding reaction is appropriate:  
103 
 “if we have had reduced sleep or quality of sleep and we might be able to modify (the 
session), but we only really do that onc e I spoke to (the athlete) to see really how they 
were feeling”(R5)  
A key layer of information is the athletes’ chronic reporting patterns. Participants noted 
that the athlete’s reporting history is taken into consideration before taking action:  
“…..if it' s consistently bad or consistently good, at least it's consistent and we then start 
to get a gauge of where (the athlete) score themselves”(R4) or “(This athlete) always 
reports his mood as one so it doesn't really matter”(R4)  
5.4.3.3  Maintaining Data Integrity  
Data compliance and accuracy lead to data integrity and should take priority within the 
process. Maintaining data accuracy requires strict adherence to the consensus guidelines; 
however, maintaining data compliance requires a more flexible approach in the pr actical 
environment. Participants highlighted that getting a full, but not perfect, picture was 
deemed sufficient in their environment when it came to data compliance.  
“You’re inevitably never going to have everyone do it perfect all the time, so nearly 
perfect most of the time is quite good”(R7)  
A lack of staff time and resources were two barriers to good data accuracy and compliance 
that were highlighted during the eva luation process.  
 “It's just a time to go check it up and make sure that it's all there ….”(R7)  
 “How resourced medicine is across the board in all the high -performance sports in 
Ireland. It's so poor”(R2)  
Athlete status or performance level (tier) was se en to impact data compliance. How 
established the athlete is within the training environment may lead to flexible levels of 
accountability in using the system consistently. Coaches noted that younger athletes who 
are not fully compliant, should receive edu cation on monitoring practices and benefits to 
change their reporting habits.  
“if they are teens or youth athletes……I think that's absolutely a question around why 
they need to value this, and an explanation of how you need to value it because this is 
what  we do for you” (R4)  
104 
 However, established athletes may require a more individualised approach which can 
affect data compliance.  
“…..if I was to have a conversation with them regularly about (maintaining data 
collection)….I would then lose the opportunity to maybe get another meaningful message 
across to them…..I just decide the data is just irrelevant…”(R4)  
Athlete status within the high -performance system can have a significant impact on the 
threshold of medical attention, thus affecting data accuracy.  
“…some athletes get different treatment and preferential treatment than others and that's 
just a nuance of high -performance sport”(R2)  
One responder summarised:  “high -performance sport is elite and it isn't equitable”(R2)  
Finally, individual beliefs and att itudes also impacted how MDCs respond to athletes and 
therefore can have an effect on injury/illness surveillance accuracy.  
“some athletes…….are used to getting stuff escalated and then others are not….it's not 
necessarily related to the presentation that 's in front of you…”(R2)  
 “….one person who might have a little sore shoulder who swims through it…..somebody 
else who's like, I can't swim….and you know it’s the exact same presentation”(R1)  
5.4.3.4  The Coach’s Influence on the Monitoring Process  
Coaches’ level of engagement with the system and its outputs can have a significant 
impact.  Participants noted that coaches who are more data driven tend to interact with 
the system in a greater way.  
“I think if you’re not quite as data driven, you wouldn’t see the benefit of it. I know there’s 
some coaches that struggle to read it, but they’re also the ones that are not data 
driven”(R4)  
A clear aspect of this theme was that coaches interacted with asp ects of the system they 
found to be useful irrespective of scientific rigour surrounding the measure.  
“I’m not massive on RPEs, I’m not massively driven by how someone scores it and then 
it related to a training week and load”(R4)  
105 
 All coaches highlighted that sleep (quality or quantity) was a key metric that they tracked 
closely in the athletes; however, they framed its importance as performance consistency 
and enhancement.  
“certain  athletes not getting enough sleep…that then means that their ability to recover 
from one session to the next is going to be hampered. So the quality of the next session is 
going to be impacted in a negative sense”(R5)  
5.5 Discussion  
The primary aim of this st udy was to describe the design and implementation of an 
integrated system running concurrently throughout a competitive swim season. The 
secondary aim was to evaluate the integrated system after a full season of data collection 
and to make future recommend ations regarding such systems. The design and evaluation 
of such a system can guide the competitive swimming community in training load and 
injury/illness surveillance best practice. The TRIPP model highlights that only research 
that is adopted by applied practitioners will be successful in preventing injuries (Finch 
2006) . Accordingly, the design of this integrated system had to not only comply with b est 
practice but also be adopted effectively in a real -world setting. In compliance with stage 
one of the TRIPP framework, the system was designed prospectively, across two separate 
training venues and in conjunction with injury/illness surveillance consen sus guidelines 
(Mountjoy et al., 2016; Bahr et al., 2020)  and training load monitoring bes t practice 
(Schwellnus et al., 2016; Soligard et al., 2016; Bourdon et al., 2017) . The adherence to 
key consensus guidelines maintains methodological consistency, allows accurate 
comparison of studies (Bahr et al., 2020)  and replication in a practical setting. 
Additionally, the integrated system sought to comply with stage two of the TRIPP m odel. 
This stage corresponds with the need to provide an aetiological understanding of the 
injury/illness surveillance data. In the absence of stage two, epidemiological researchers 
and practitioners are left with exemplar injury/illness (frequency/pattern ) data (‘What is 
Epidemiology?’ 2016)  but no understanding of the determining causes or risk factors 
(Finch 2006) .  
The optimal implementation of a monitoring system is underpinned by its simplicity and 
acceptability (World Health Organization 2001) . Subsequently, the system needs to 
minimise burden and place the user at the centre of the design, evaluation,  and 
improvements. This system was evaluated with these principles in mind. High levels of 
satisfaction in the overall system design from both the athletes and coaches/MDCs were 
106 
 found. Additionally, the system’s usefulness and ease of use were rated positively with a 
low perception of burden within the monitoring process. Despite these positive findings, 
during the end -user evaluation, it was found that athletes highlighted some constraints 
within the monitoring process. Athletes noted that exam periods (where student -athlete 
workload increases) and early mornings were the most one rous or challenging periods. 
This is a key finding as academic stress has been related to the incidence of injury 
(Hausken -Sutter et al., 2021)  thus elevating th e need for monitoring during such a high -
risk period.  
Barriers to the implementation of monitoring systems have been well documented in 
recent years with stakeholder compliance and engagement being significant determinants 
for success (Yeomans et al., 2019; Griffin et al., 2020b) . Athlete evaluation of the system 
showed that data access and control is a key aspect of maintaining data compliance. 
Athletes noted that having access to their inputted data, with the ability to review, edit or 
delete data i n real -time would improve data compliance and accuracy. Interestingly, the 
coaches/MDCs also highlighted data compliance and accuracy as a significant aspect of 
the monitoring process. Coaches/MDCs commented that a “nearly perfect”  dataset was 
sufficient, as compliance across the whole group longitudinally was unrealistic. 
Diminished compliance is a common theme regarding monitoring in the research 
(Neupert et al., 2019) , and while there are strategies to improve compliance through 
education , there is also a practical solution to addressing the “inevitable”  occurrence of 
missing data (Griffin, Kenny, Comyns, Purtill, et al.  2021) . Griffin et al., (2021) outlined 
a method to a ddress missing data. However, this method needs to be investigated further 
within an individual sport environment. Practically , it is useful to have both interventions 
working in conjunction throughout the season. Long -term education of the athlete is 
necessary for improved compliance. However, in the short term, the ability to address 
missing data effectively is also pertinent for practitioners.   
Coaches/MDCs also highlighted that data compliance is related to athlete status. In the 
practical environment,  non-compliant younger athletes may receive an educational 
intervention into the benefits of the system. However, more established athletes may 
receive more flexibility within the process. Athletes within this study received education 
through an athlete ha ndbook and a 12-week  familiarisation process. These findings show 
that more continuous athlete education and feedback throughout the season may be 
necessary to maintain higher levels of engagement and compliance. Support staff who 
take an individualised ap proach to athlete compliance should consider the cost/benefits 
107 
 of this strategy. Duignan et al., (2019) found athlete -specific education was a key aspect 
of improving engagement but also noted that inequity between adhering and non -adhering 
athletes dimini shed motivation and created interpersonal distrust and disharmony 
(Duignan et al., 2019). An inequitable athlete environment was also highlighted within 
our findings where athlete status (tier level, funding, etc.) would have an impact on the 
level of medical attention received. Athletes in the upper tiers of the system would 
typically get access to medical attention at an earlier stage or a lower symptom threshold 
than an athlete of a lower tier. This, despite adherence to research -based consensus 
guidelines, could create hidden nuances when reporting medical attention data. Given this 
individual variation, grouping data by tier level may be the most valid (or accurate) 
representation of the data.  
Stakeholder communication is one of the most commonly cited uses of a monitoring 
system (Saw et al., 2015) . In this instance, coaches/MDCs highlighted that the system 
provided a communication pla tform for athletes to identify any issues which they might 
not otherwise verbally communicate. This placed the responsibility on the coaches/MDCs 
to initiate a conversation with the athlete regarding their wellbeing disclosures. It also 
fostered a more tar geted approach by the coaches/MDCs within the multidisciplinary 
team (MDT) by allowing them to attend to specific athletes with concerns in a more 
directed manner. This potentially reduces the time between wellbeing disclosure and 
intervention which is ide al in a performance environment. This communication pathway 
also allows for a layer of context to be generated. Coaches/MDCs noted that in many 
cases the acute response was not a ‘knee jerk’  decision and action should not be taken 
until after a conversatio n has taken place. The context of knowing the athlete and their 
chronic reporting trends is also a key aspect of the information. Before acting, a coach 
can mediate their response based on their prior knowledge of the athlete’s reporting 
history or persona lity traits. This response was echoed by Saw et al., (2015) where they 
described interpreting the athlete’s data based on knowing the athlete’s circumstances and 
personality traits as being the ‘art’ of coaching. Keeping this in mind, coaches/MDCs 
should b e aware that when implementing a monitoring system, there should be an inbuilt 
lead time where data is collected consistently, observed for trends,  and understood in 
relation to the individual athlete before being used as a decision -making tool.  
Previous research has shown that coaches not engaging with or acting upon athlete data 
was a significant barrier within the monitoring process (Griffin et al., 2020b) . In this 
instance, coaches highlighted many ways in which they engaged with the system; 
108 
 however, it was clear that a coach’s personal opinions of c ertain metrics dictated the 
degree of engagement. It was noted that coaching style may be an influencing factor with 
one coach stating those who are less data -driven will not see the benefits in the system. It 
was also mentioned the use of sRPE was not a p riority based on the coach’s own opinions 
of the metrics and not based on a scientific argument (validity, reliability, etc.) A key 
mismatch between the athletes’ and coaches’ perception of what key metrics they felt best 
represented their ability to train  as planned also exists. Coaches very specifically value 
the sleep duration and quality metrics, while athletes largely prioritised the energy rating. 
This conflict of beliefs could lead to a degree of athlete mismanagement where coaches 
may not react as r eadily to a poor energy rating versus a poor sleep rating based on 
personal bias. A multidirectional feedback loop, where coaches and athletes engage in 
open conversation about the expectations and beliefs on the monitoring process should 
occur regularly t o reduce this disparity.  
Finally, the collection of accurate illness information was seen as a challenge. The 
qualitative findings highlighted that potentially the under -resourcing of medical support 
meant that in the practical environment MDCs were not r eceiving adequate information 
to create an accurate diagnosis record. In the absence of a sports medicine doctor attached 
to a training centre, athletes went to their home General Practitioner for medical attention , 
resulting in the subsequent diagnosis bei ng relayed back to the MDCs by the athlete. 
Similarly, for an illness which did not require medical attention but was affecting the 
athlete ( “stuff above the throat…head cold, or maybe some mild GI symptoms”),  MDCs 
often relied on a coach to relay a diagno sis which was not deemed to be an appropriate 
reporting pathway. These barriers to reporting illness information may lead to an under -
reporting of medical attention illnesses and an inaccurate reporting of non -time loss, non -
medical attention illnesses in particular. Going forward, a system of this nature should be 
tailored to suit the available resources. In the absence of adequate medical support, 
symptom -based  reporting by the individual athlete may be the preferred reporting avenue. 
Despite the inherent  bias, athlete self -reported measures can broaden the scope of 
injury/illness surveillance and can be implemented in conjunction with a valid and 
reliable questionnaire (e.g. Health Problems Questionnaire) (Clarsen et al.  2014; Toohey 
and Drew 2 020). 
109 
 5.6 Limitations  
A key strength of this study is also a weakness. Research into elite sports continuously 
face discord between the inherent small population to draw from and the unique viewpoint 
that the population can offer. To this end, limiting the research design to so lely include 
two of Swim Ireland’s National Training Centres resulted in a small participant sample 
size. Future research may overcome this by adjusting the study design to increase the 
number of data points (continuous evaluation over the season rather th an cross -sectional) 
(Skorski and Hecksteden 2021)  or expanding the study design to cooperating elite training 
centres internationally (Impellizzeri , 2017) .  
5.7 Conclusions  
The integration of training load monitoring and injury/illness surveillance is necessary to 
elevate the standard of prospective injury/illness sur veillance research in competitive 
swimming. The design of the integrated system provided for research -based data 
collection processes, which received positive apprais al. However, the design must be 
complemented by an effective implementation process to ach ieve robust and accurate 
data collection. A continuous end -user evaluation process is a necessary step which 
allows for the evolution of the system to meet the dynamic demands of a sporting 
environment. One key finding of the evaluation process highlighted  that the resources 
available should align with the needs of the integrated system, allowing for improved 
collection of all data. Findings also highlighted that the implementation should occur 
gradually allowing for a period of uninterrupted data collectio n where staff can gain a 
deeper understanding of individual athlete reporting habits. Once accomplished, coaches 
should use the system as an “alert” to potential issues, allowing the coach to instigate 
communication with the athlete. Considering all inform ation, including the athletes 
reporting history and personality traits before taking decisive action is advised . 
Furthermore, the continuous collection of accurate and consistent data should be 
prioritised particularly during periods of high external d emands ( e.g., exam periods). 
Athletes should receive additional attention to maintain compliance or coaches should 
employ different monitoring strategies during these periods ( e.g., increased verbal 
communication/objective markers). Athlete education into the benefits and uses of the 
monitoring process is necessary to maintain high levels of athlete compliance, however 
this education needs to occur early in the monitoring process and be continuous 
throughout the season. Similarly, coaches need to be educate d on the cost/benefits of 
110 
 treating higher tiered athletes differently within the monitoring process than their lower 
tiered counterparts. Despite creating a flexible and individualised approach for certain 
athletes, there is a high risk of developing an ad verse athlete culture leading to larger and 
subsequent challenges. Future design and implementation of integrated systems needs to 
adhere to best practice through consensus guidelines, while also working to counteract 
these real -world challenges .
111 
 5.8 Link to the Next Chapter  
Chapter five has collated the findings and recommendations from the previous chapters  
and outlined the design and implementation of an integrated training load monitoring and 
injury/illness surveillance syst em. Also, the system was reviewed after one season using 
an end -user evaluation process as per recommendations from the World Health 
Organisation. The system outlined in Chapter five was employed in a longitudinal and 
prospective data collection process as  recommended in Chapter two. This 104 -week 
observation period was used to collect training load and injury/illness surveillance data 
from Swim Irelands National Centre athletes (n=34). Chapter six presents a crucial study 
in this programme of research whic h utilises the data collected during the observation 
period to investigate the relationship between training load, or its aggregate measures and 
medical attention injuries and illnesses. Chapter one and two highlighted the need for 
longitudinal, prospective  studies which utilised the sRPE  method. The chapters also 
advocated for studies to align with the most recent injury/illness surveillance consensus 
statements. Finally, it was deemed important to provide clarity on the level of participants 
used within th is research. These recommendations were embraced in the design of the 
integrated system in Chapter five and has elevated the impact of the findings of Chapter 
six which otherwise may have been interpreted under the cloud of methodological 
limitations highlighted  in previous research. This study adds to the body of research 
discussed in Chapter two and addresses the paucity of information  highlighted in the 
previous chapters.

 Chapter 6  An Exploration of the Relationship between 
Training Load and Injury  and Illness in Competitive 
Swimming
113 
 6.1 Abstract  
Background:  Training load monitoring has been seen as a method to reduce the risk of 
injury and illness in competitive sport. Traditionally, the practice of monitoring training 
load in swimming has been seen as overly reliant on external training load measures. The 
use of the sRPE method has been found to be an ecologically valid method of monitoring 
training load in competitive swimmers.  
Aims:  The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between  training load 
monitoring, using the sRPE method, and injury and illness in competitive swimmers.  
Methods:  Data w ere collected using a prospective, longitudinal study design. Data 
included sRPE -TL (AU), session swim volume (km) and medical attention injury and 
illness surveillance data. Data w ere gathered from  32 athletes centralised in two (Limerick 
and Dublin) of Swim Ireland’s National Centres  over 104 -weeks.  
Results:  Training load monitoring showed the  average weekly volume was 33.5 ± 12.9 
km. The weekly total training load (AU) averaged 3,838 ± 1,616.1 AU . A total of 60 
medical attention illness events and a  total of 58 medical attention injury events were 
recorded . A multilevel logistic regression was used to analyse the association between 
sRPE -TL and medical attention injuries or illnesses. The analyses  found no association 
between the results of this study , show ing that Weekly Pool Volume (km), 4 -week 
Rolling Pool Volume (km), Weekly Total Load Training (AU), 4 -week Rolling Total 
Training Load (AU)  and ACWR  were not associated with medical attention injur ies or 
illnesses  in this cohort of athletes.  
Conclusions:  The findings suggest that using a single training load metric in isolation 
cannot decisively inform when an injury or illness will occur. Instead, coaches should 
utilis e these monitoring tools to id entify the competition loads for athletes and help 
coaches prepare for them adequately. Future research should strive to investigate the 
relationship between additional risk factors, in combination with training load and 
injury/illness in competitive swimm ers.

 6.2 Introduction  
Athlete health and performance are intimately linked and have been the focus of much 
research examining their relationship with the goal of promoting athlete or team success 
(Drew et al. , 2017). In team sports, lower injury incidence, lower injury burden a nd higher 
match availability have been associated with positive performance outcomes (Hägglund 
et al. , 2013; Williams et al. , 2016). Similarly, in individual sports, the likelihood of 
achieving performance goals has been shown to significantly increase thr ough 
minimising injury and illness -related training interruptions (Raysmith and Drew 2016). 
In competitive swimming, a similar association has been reported where mild illness ha s 
a harmful effect on male athletes’ performance (Pyne 2005). Competitive swimm ers often 
continue to train and compete with health issues (Matsuura et al. , 2020), while swimming 
has been shown to have a higher incidence of injury in training than in competition 
(Soligard et al. , 2017).  Training demands in competitive swimming can inv olve 
completing 18,000 m daily with a high frequency of sessions across a training week 
(Feijen et al. , 2021). These demanding training regimes require stringent planning, 
monitoring and assessment to minimise any potential time lost from training (Pollock  et 
al., 2019).  Training load monitoring is commonplace in elite sports (Mitchell et al. , 2020) 
and is used to support training practices (Hellard et al. , 2017) and inform the relative risk 
of injury and illness (Mitchell et al. , 2020).  
Preventing injury  and illness is a multifactorial process (Impellizzeri et al.,  2020). 
However, according to Gabbett (2016), training load  related injuries and illnesses are 
preventable. Training load  monitoring practices in competitive swimming research 
typically involve swim volume (i.e., meters, kilometres,  or hours), heart rate or blood 
lactate (Feijen et al.,  2020), while the use of session rate of perceived exertion (sRPE) in 
a practical training environment is common (Barry et al.,  2022). The relationship between 
training load  and injury and illness in a wider sporting context has been frequently 
researched w ith poorly managed training load  increasing the risk of injury and illness 
(Schwellnus et al.,  2016; Soligard et al.,  2016). In a review investigating the relationship 
between training load  and injury, illness and soreness in multiple sports, Drew & Finch 
(2016) found moderate evidence indicating a dose -response  relationship between the 
amount of training load  and injury, while there was conflicting evidence to support the 
relationship between training load  and illness. More specific to competitive swimming,  a 
systematic review by Barry et al.,  (2021) found limited evidence of a relationship between 
training load  and injury,  and illness. However, the review highlighted a large variety of 
115 
 training load  methods being employed in the research, with only one stud y monitoring 
training load  using sRPE. The review concluded that future research should focus on 
longitudinal prospective studies, utilising the sRPE monitoring method and investigating 
the applicability of Acute/Chronic Workload Ratio (ACWR) through the e xponentially 
weighted moving average (EWMA) method. The review also determined that due to a 
host of methodological limitations and a clear lack of consistency in reporting, further 
rigorous investigation into the relationship between training load  and inj ury and illness in 
a competitive swimming population was needed. This finding has been echoed by 
Trinidad et al.,  (2021) who also found a lack of consistent methodological approaches 
whilst reviewing the epidemiology of swimming injuries.  
The primary aim o f this research was to explore the association between training load  and 
medical attention injury and illness (time loss/non -time loss) in competitive swimmers. 
This prospective research will build on the aforementioned recommendations, include 
internal and  external load monitoring using the sRPE method and aligns with the 
Federation Internationale de Natation (FINA) (Mountjoy et al.,  2016) and International 
Olympic Committee (IOC) (Bahr et al.,  2020) injury and illness consensus statements.  
6.3 Methods  
6.3.1 Study d esign  
This prospective cohort study was conducted in two of Swim Ireland’s National Training 
Centres over two seasons, a 104 -week period from September 2020 to September 2022.  
Data collection consisted of three separate data -streams. Athletes self -reporte d subjective 
training load data, including sRPE and session duration in minutes allowing for the total 
session load to be calculated (sRPE -TL), National Centre head coaches reported 
individual attendance records and training load  data (session Pool Volume (km)) and 
medical data collectors (MDCs) collated injury and illness surveillance data. These data 
reporting processes were introduced to the National Centres at the end of the previous 
season allowing for an extensive period (12 -weeks) of familiarisation with the process to 
occur. MDCs were provided with an injury/illness surveillance handbook prior to the start 
of data collection and an online briefing meeting was held to discuss the process of data 
collection.  
116 
 6.3.2 Participants  
A total  of 34 athletes centralised in two (Limerick and Dublin) of Swim Ireland’s National 
Centres were registered to take part in the study over the two -year period. All participants 
were provided with a study information sheet and an informed consent form. All athletes 
at each National Centre agreed to participate resulting in 100% recruitment of the 
available population. Athletes were assigned an ability level presented in Table 6-3 based 
on the framework of McKay et al. , (2022). This framework was designed to practically 
classify the activity level and athletic ability of individual athletes, allowing for 
uniformity wit hin participant demographics in research. The framework has six tiers 
spanning from Tier 0 (trained/developmental) to Tier 5 (World Class) (McKay et al. , 
2022).  Two athletes were removed from the final analysis.  One athlete retired from 
swimming within ei ght weeks of the start of data collection due to COVID -19 training -
related restrictions, while the second athlete had a pre -existing congenital disorder, which 
may have influenced their individual data. The participant breakdown over the two 
seasons is ill ustrated in Figure 6-1. This study was approved by the University Ethics 
Committee (2019_10_09_EHS).

 6.3.3 Data Collection  
The data collection system and procedures have been previously outlined in Barry et al. , 
(2023). Athletes self -reported subjective training load  data through the online application 
Kitman LabsTM (kitmanlabs.com ), which could be accessed through a mobile ph one. 
Athletes were asked to rate their perceived effort for the entirety of a given session on the 
modified Borg scale (1 -10) (as adapted from the Borg CR10 scale (Borg , 1998)) on the 
same day of completion. They were also asked to record the session durat ion (minutes) 
of the activity and select the activity type (i.e., swimming, S&C – strength, S&C – 
conditioning or racing). sRPE –TL was calculated by multiplying the sRPE by the 
duration of the activity, as outlined previously (Foster et al.,  2001; Wallace et al.,  2008; 
Griffin et al.,  2020a). Athlete self -reported data were audited for completeness on a 
weekly basis. Individual athletes were contacted regarding missing or suspicious data, 
with any omissions or errors being clarified. Coaches within each Nat ional Centre 
provided individual session -by-session athlete swim volumes and attendance records 
through a report emailed to the lead researcher. These data were cross -checked against 
the athlete self -reported data and any queries were taken to the relevant  coach and 
addressed where necessary.  
The injury/illness surveillance system had three MDCs on the project. MDCs were 
chartered physiotherapists based within each National Centre. Each MDC had sole 
responsibility for a set group of athletes allowing for a  manageable workload.  MDCs 
inputted injury/illness data into a bespoke Microsoft Excel worksheet, designed in line 
with the Orchard Sports Injury and Illness Classification System (OSIICS) (Orchard et 
al., 2020). Injury and illness were defined as per Bah r et al. , (2020). MDCs were emailed 
biweekly with a reminder to input any injury/illness information. A monthly follow up 
video call to audit the data inputted was also conducted. Injury and illness were 
subcategorised as medical attention, time loss or no n-time loss. Time -loss and medical 
attention were defined as per Mountjoy et al. , (2016). Time loss was reported from the 
date of onset until the athlete was fully available for training or competition. Fully 
available was clarified as without modification  of training prescription, modification of 
technique or deficits in performance directly related to the injury and illness. Illness or 
injuries were also defined by severity as per Mountjoy et al. , (2016). Additional 
information collected also included mode  of onset, circumstances of injury, injury/illness 
classification, location, type,  and diagnosis as described in Barry et al. , (2023). To include 
119 
 the most robust injury and illness surveillance data for analysis, medical attention injury 
and illness were selected for analysis. Table 6-1 outlines the key definitions used.  
Table 6-1 Definitions of key term s used within the injury/illness surveillance system.   
Term  Definition  
Injury  Tissue damage or other derangement of normal physical function, resulting from 
rapid or competitive transfer of kinetic energy  (Bahr et al.  2020) . 
Illness  A complaint or disorder, experienced by an athlete, not related to injury. Illnesses 
include health related problems in physical ( e.g., influenza), mental  (e.g., depression) 
or social well -being, removal or loss of vital elements (air, water, warmth)  (Bahr et 
al. 2020) . 
Medical 
Attention  A physical complaint where a qualiﬁed clinician has assessed the athlete’s physical 
complaint or medical condition. A qualified clinician is anyone who is involved in 
the health care of athletes, reviews medical or physiological information, and/or 
implements an action plan to improve the athlete’s health, where health is considered 
in a broad sense but must be more than performance enhancement  (Mountjoy et al.  
2016) . 
Time Loss  A health problem which leads to the athlete being unable to take full part in FINA 
activities. If the athlete misses the rest of the training or competition session but 
returns for the  next training/competition, this should be recorded as a time -loss 
incident  (Mountjoy et al.  2016) . 
Severity  Mild 0 -7 days missed, moderate 8 -28 days missed, severe >29 days missed  
(Mountjoy et al.  2016) .

 6.3.4 Statistical Analysis  
Daily athlete training load  data were accumulated and reported as weekly training load  
data and included the key variables as described in Table 6-2. Medical attention injury 
and illness (time loss/non -time loss) were recorded as a binary variable where  no 
occurrence was noted as 0 and an occurrence was noted as 1. A lag period of 7 days was 
calculated for every training monitoring variable by moving the participant’s variables 
back one week in relation to the incidence of injury or illness events. A sev en-day lag 
period was chosen to overcome the potential of a time loss event creating an artificial low 
load on the week the event occurs and potentially a type II error occurring during analysis 
(Drew and Finch 2016). A time lag was also pertinent as there  has been a suggestion of a 
delayed effect between training load exposure and injury or illness (Gabbett 2016). One 
week prior to injury or illness would also represent the latest period of adjustment a coach 
could make to their pre -planned training week, thus making it practically relevant and 
impactful. All training load data were scaled as shown in Table 6-2. sRPE was scaled as 
per Tiernan et al.,  (2022), with Weekly Pool Volume (km) scaled to the nearest kilometer 
or ten kilometers in the case of 4 -week Rolling Pool Volume (km) . Data w ere scaled to 
improve the practical application of the findings.  
Exploratory and descriptive analyses were undertaken using Microsoft Excel (V. 
16.0.5378) and IBM SPSS (V. 26). Descriptive analysis included calculating the 
maximum, minimum, mean, standard deviation and  variance for both within and between 
participant groups. Key training load  variables (Weekly Pool Volume (km), 4 -week 
Rolling Pool Volume (km), Weekly Total Load Training (AU), 4 -week Rolling Total 
Training Load (AU) and ACWR (EWMA)) were selected for ana lysis. Weekly Pool 
Volume (km) and Weekly Total Load Training (AU) were both selected as they are the 
most frequently used metrics in competitive swimming (Barry et al.,  2022). The 4 -week 
rolling metrics were selected to explore the accumulated effect of training load , while 
ACWR was a key recommendation based on previous literature (Rogalski et al.,  2013; 
Tiernan 2020; Griffin 2021 ; Barry et al.,  2021 ). Descriptive analysis for participants  is 
presented in  
Table 6-4. The data were visually inspected by plotting all variables using histograms 
and normality was assessed using Shapiro Wilks test with an alpha level set at p<0.05 as 
detailed in Griffin (2021 ). Assumptions for normality were not met and non -parametric 
tests were selected for additional exploratory analyses. Subsequent  analyses included 
122 
 using Spearman’s Rank Correlations to investigate the relationship between medical 
attention injury and illnes s (time -loss or non -time loss) and key training load variables.  
The exploratory analyses summary is presented in Appendix  6.  
Based on the exploratory and descriptive analys es and findings, RStudio.ink (V.4.2.2) 
was used to further analyse the data. Visual  representation of the data through dot and 
violin plots were created to explore the impact of medical attention injury and illness 
(time -loss or non -time loss) on the key training load  variables. A generalised linear mixed 
effects model was employed to est imate both random and fixed effects. A multilevel 
binary logistic regression approach was taken to investigate the relationship between 
medical attention injury and illness (time loss/non -time loss) and key training load  
variables. This modelling was employ ed as the response variable was dichotomous. The 
model would also allow the analysis to assess how well the training load variables 
predicted the odds of an injury/illness occurring but also would provide a summary of the 
accuracy of the “goodness of fit”.  This would help determine the percent of predictions 
made from the model that would return a positive response (Fritz and Berger 2015). 
Analys es were conducted using R packages lme4 (Bates et al.,  2015), reshape2 (Wickham 
2007), sjPlot (Lüdecke 2022), ggp lot2 (Wickham 2016) and dfoptim (Varadhan and 
Borchers 2020). An optimiser (BOBYQA) was employed to support the model. Odds 
ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated to investigate the odds of a 
medical attention injury and illness (time loss /non-time loss) given key training load  
variables. Where an OR was >1, an increased odds of injury was reported, and where an 
OR was <1 a decreased odds of injury was reported (Rogalski et al.,  2013). This analysis 
was repeated for a 0 -day lag period and a  7-day lag period. The probability of the analysis 
reaching statistical significance using the arbitrary cut off of p< .05 was not applied during 
this analysis. As this population was not a randomised sample the assumption that the 
findings could be applie d to a random sample of competitive swimmers could not be met. 
It is also recognised that the context behind these data analys es and results is more 
valuable than a threshold of p<0.05 can ascertain (Wasserstein and Lazar 2016; 
Wasserstein et al.,  2019).  
6.4 Results  
A total of 32 athlete data sets were included for analysis. Participant demographics are 
included in Table 6-3. Participant classification is presented based on  McKay et al ., 
(2022).

 6.4.1 Training Load  
Participants were observed for a total of 104 weeks across two seasons. Athletes  typically 
completed 6 -10 pool sessions per week (12 -20 hours), depending on their specialist event. 
Athletes on average attended a minimum of two S&C sessions per week. Across the two 
seasons, the average weekly volume was 33.5 ± 12.9 km. The weekly total  training load 
(AU) averaged 3,838 ± 1,616.1 AU, with 85% of that load coming from swimming. Due 
to the diverse nature of swimming events and the range of specialist swimmers included 
within the cohort an individual participant summary of the training load  variables is 
presented in Appendix 6. Figure 6-2 illustrates the  mean weekly training total load (AU)  
for the participant group as well as the weekly occurrence of medical attention injury and 
illness (time loss/non -time loss).

 6.4.2 Illness  
A total of 60 medical attention illness events were  recorded during the observation 
period. A total of 84 .4% (n=27) of the participants registered at least one medical 
attention illness event during the data collection period. The majority (93.3%, n=56) of 
illnesses were categorised as time loss. Time loss  illness severity was categorised as 
mild (53.6%, n=30) or moderate (46.4%, n=26) with no illnesses categorised as severe. 
A large portion (76.7%, n=46) of the illnesses were categorised as “acute – sudden 
onset”, with the remainder being categorised as “r epetitive – sudden onset” (8.3%, n=5), 
“repetitive – gradual onset” (6.7%, n=4) or “mixed/other” (8.3%, n=5).  Communicable 
medical attention illnesses were most prevalent (76.7%, n=46), while respiratory 
infections were the most common (70%, n=42) type of  illness recorded. COVID -19 was 
the most common diagnosis (36.7%, n=22) with upper respiratory tract infection being 
the second most common (21.7%, n=13). Figure 6-2 and Figure 6-3 both illustrate a 
sudden and large increase in the frequency of illness during weeks 69 -72. This 
represents a period where , post national competition , both National Centres had a 
cluster of COVID -19 cases where multiple athletes contracted the infectious disease.  
6.4.3 Injuries  
A total of 58 medical attention injury events were recorded with 78 .1% (n=25) of 
participants registering at least one medical attentio n injury event during the data 
collection process. Time loss injuries accounted for 36.2% (n=21) of all events, while 
non-time loss injuries were more prevalent (63.8%, n=37). Time loss injury severity was 
largely categorised as mild (95.2%, n=20), with on ly one injury being categorised as 
moderate and none categorised as severe. “Acute – sudden onset” injuries made up 44.8% 
(n=26) of all events, with “repetitive – sudden onset” (27.6%, n=16), “repetitive – gradual 
onset” (25.9%, n=15) or “mixed/other” (1.7 %, n=1) accounting for the remainder.  The 
majority of injuries were sustained during either swim specific training (46.6%, n=27) or 
S&C/dryland training (34.5%, n=20). Non -contact injuries were most common (79.3%, 
n=46) while direct contact with an object  (e.g., making contact with equipment) was also 
a factor (19%, n=11). The shoulder (24.1%, n=14), lumbar spine (17.2%, n=10) and ankle 
(12.1%, n=7) were the locations most injured. However, additional injured areas included 
the knee (8.6%, n=5), groin/hip (8.6%, n=5), thoracic spine, neck,  and hand (all 5.2%, 
n=3), foot (3.4%, n=2), wrist, upper arm, lower leg, head, forearm,  and abdomen (all 
1.7%, n=1).

 6.4.4 0-Day Time Lag  
A total of 20 logistic regression analyses were completed to explore the association 
between key training load  variables and the incidence of medical attention injury and 
illness (time loss/non -time loss). Table 6-5 outlines the results of these analyses.  Figure 
6-4 illustrates  a forest plot of the results  providing a visual representation of the point 
estimate and its measure of effect in relation to the null hypothesis (OR=1). Confidence 
intervals are also presented (horizontal whiskers) for each analysis.  The results in the 
main presented odds ratios of 1 or close to 1, resulting in no association between the 
training load  variable and the odds of an injury and illness (time loss/non -time loss) 
occurrin g. The analysis between ACWR (AU) and non -time loss injury suggested that 
there was a negative association  between the two variables (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.79 – 
1.00). However, the confidence interval including 1 suggest that the finding is not 
significant. Si milarly, time loss illness was negatively  associated with both Weekly Total 
Load Training (AU) (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.93 – 0.96) and Weekly Pool Volume (km)  (OR 
0.94, 95% CI 0.92 – 0.96). These results whilst statistically significant  include OR’s of 
0.94 mean ing the effect size of the result is small (Sullivan and Feinn 2012) .

 6.4.5 7- Day Time Lag  
A further 20 logistic regressions were completed to explore the association between key 
training load  variables and the incidence of medical attention injury and illness (time 
loss/non -time loss) when a 7 -day time lag was present. Table 6-6 outlines the results of 
these analyses.  Figure 6-5 illustrates a forest plot of the results providing a visual 
representation of the point estimate and its measure of effect in relation to the null 
hypothesis (OR=1). Confidence intervals are also presented (horizontal whiskers) for 
each analysis.  The results in the main presented odds ratios of 1  or close to 1, resulting in 
no association between the training load  variable and the odds of an injury and illness 
(time loss/non -time loss) occurring.  The analysis between ACWR (AU) and non -time 
loss illness suggested that there was a negative association between the two variables (OR 
0.85, 95% CI 0.59 – 1.21). However, the confidence interval including 1 suggest s that the 
finding is not statistically significant.

 6.5 Discussion  
The aim of this study was to explore the association between training load  and injury and 
illness in competitive swimmers. Building on previous literature recommendations, the 
exploration of the relationship between training load  and injury and illness was carried 
out in line with both the FINA (Mountjoy et al. , 2016) and IOC (Ba hr et al. , 2020) injury 
and illness consensus statements. It was  also grounded in best practices for training load  
monitoring by employing the use of internal and external training load  monitoring 
methods with a particular focus on sRPE and key aggregate m easures. Fundamentally, 
numerous analyses examining the association between training load  variables and 
medical attention injury, or illness (time loss/non -time loss) returned odds ratios of 1.0 or 
approaching 1.0. This occurred irrespective of a 0 -day or 7-day lag time. These findings 
suggest that there was no association between the training load metric and medical 
attention injury and illness. Also, many of the confidence intervals coupled with the odds 
ratio crossed 1.0 or reported a lower or higher conf idence interval equalling  1.0 
suggesting the findings were not statistically significant. The primary variables included 
in these analyses were Weekly Pool Volume (km), 4 -week Rolling Pool Volume (km), 
Weekly Total Load Training (AU) and 4 -week Rolling Tot al Training Load (AU)  and 
ACWR (AU) .  
Typically, Weekly Pool Volume (km), an external training load  metric, has been most 
commonly used  by swim coaches to plan and design a swim programme periodisation 
strategy and monitor athletes’  response to training (Barry et al.,  2022). However, using 
training load  monitoring for injury reduction purposes has been reported as less common 
(Barry et al., 2022). This is despite previous research suggesting that  repetitive overhead 
arm movements  in swimming, combined with laxity, strength deficits and fatigue,  are 
linked with  shoulder injury and pain (Weldon and Richardson 2001). However, in 
research to date, the relationship between pool volume and injury rate has been described 
as “questionable” (Lippincott 2018). Tate et al.,  (2012) highlighted that swimming 
exposure was a factor in shoulder pain, dissatisfaction,  and disability in competitive 
swimmers, while supraspinatus tendon thickness was affected  by the number of 
competitive years within an athlete’s swimming career (Sein et al.,  2010). More specific 
to swim volume (km ), Walker et al.,  (2012) found no association between shoulder injury 
and training mileage (km). Much of the ambiguity surrounding a consensus on the 
relationship between these variables has been attributed to methodological 
inconsistencies and limitations . This study sought to address these methodological 
135 
 inconsistencies through the use of sport specific consensus guidelines, participant 
classification strategies and appropriate training load monitoring methods. Consequently , 
the strong methodological foun dations of this study design should allay these issues.  
Potentially, one finding that would require further investigation was the relationship 
between Weekly Pool Volume (km) and time loss illness without the 0 -day time lag  (OR 
0.94, 95% CI 0.92 – 0.96). This result indicated that the odds of a time loss illness 
decreased by 6% with every one -kilometre  increase in Weekly Pool Volume (km). This 
finding may suggest that those who swam a higher weekly pool volume were less likely 
to develop  a time loss illnes s. It has previously been found that swimmers of a higher 
ability (international) were at a lower risk of URTPI  when compared to their lower level 
(national) peers (Hellard et al. , 2015). It could be assumed in this case that those typically 
swimming highe r weekly volumes were prescribed the increased workload due to their 
advanced ability. However, analysis was not segregated by athlete level and therefore this 
cannot be accurately determined. Hellard et al. , (2015) also found that periods of high 
loads ac cumulated over several weeks resulted in an increase in upper respiratory tract 
infections (Hellard et al. , 2015). This shows that investigating accumulated training load  
is warranted. The chronic effect of external training load was investigated using an 
accumulated measure of Weekly Pool Volume (km) (4 -week Rolling Pool Volume (km). 
The findings of this study suggest that the four -week accumulated pool volume had no 
association with injury and illness (time loss/non -time loss). This may be related to the 
fact that this metric only considers the chronic impact of external training load  and does 
not incorporate internal training load .  Hellard et al. , (2015) suggested that t here was an 
increased risk of illness during intensive periods of training. These intensive periods were 
characterised by increased loads in all training modalities, including in -water and S&C 
sessions. Employing training load  metrics using external traini ng load alone which does 
not quantify S&C training load  is not suitable for monitoring the effect of total load on 
these athletes. A more appropriate metric would be sRPE derived metrics as they 
incorporate a combination of both internal and external training load  and can be used to 
quantify all aspects of the training programme (Barry et al. , 2022). The investigation of 
the sRPE derived metrics Weekly Total Load Training (AU) and 4 -week Rolling Total 
Training Load (AU) was a crucial aspect of our study ana lyses. The results of th ese 
analys es showed similar finding s to Weekly Total Load Training (AU)  and Weekly Pool 
Volume (km)  and time loss illness. The findings indicated that the odds of a time loss 
illness dec reased by 6% with every 100AU  increase in Weekly Total Load Training (AU) . 
136 
 However, t his result was not found  for the 7 -day time lag or when the 4-week Rolling 
Total Training Load (AU)  was considered.  
These findings contrast with previous literature in other sports which have found a 
positive relation ship between training load metrics and injury and illness . Gabbett (2004) 
found a reduction in absolute training load  (sRPE -TL) resulted in a corresponding 
reduction in injuries (Gabbett , 2004), while Rogalski et al.,  (2013) found that an increase 
in the 1–2-week  accumulated training load  resulted in a higher risk of injury in elite 
Australian Footballers (Rogalski et al. , 2013).  It is very difficult however, to compare 
these studies as not only are the sports vastly different, so too are the weekly training  
loads accumulated. This issue is acknowledged by Drew and Finch (2016) who noted that 
endurance -based sports typ ically display training load  with a longer duration at lower 
intensity, meanwhile other sports tend to have higher intensity training with lower 
duration making comparisons difficult. This is a common issue with much of the research 
examining training load  and injury and illness using the sRPE method. Much of the 
research is on team/field -based sports (Drew and Finch 2016; Griffin et al. , 2020b; 
Maupin et al. , 2020) where the training load  and mechanisms of injury and illness are 
considerably different to th e sport of swimming. As previously highlighted , swimming 
studies employing sRPE methods to monitor training load  are not readily available for 
comparison (Barry et al. , 2021). Tomar and Allen (2019) did use the sRPE method to 
investigate the relationship be tween training load  and injury. This study found no 
significant relationship between a variety of training metrics (weekly load (AU), 
monotony (AU), strain (AU) and ACWR (AU)) and injury (Tomar and Allen 2019). The 
authors did acknowledge that their study had a very low sample size (12 participants), 
short observation period (7 weeks), a very low number of injuries (3 injuries) and low 
absolute training load  (260.97 ± 56.33) in comparison to other studies of this nature. 
Despite the findings of Tomar and Al len (2019) and this current study being similar, the 
robust nature of the study design, lengthy observation period and elite nature of the 
participants within this study strengthens th e current body of research  evidence .  
In a research context, this  study has a ddressed  previous limitations (Barry et al. , 2021; 
Trinidad et al. , 2021) in the investigation of the relationship between training load  and 
injury and illness. Practically, the analyses investigated both absolute and relative training 
load meas ures. The relationship between external training load  measures (swim volume 
(km), combined internal and external measures (sRPE -TL) and ACWR were all 
investigated. The study design presents a strong framework for future research but also 
137 
 for applied practitioners to understand and transfer to their own environments. The 
findings of this study show that despite improving the methodological structure of the 
data collection procedures,  understanding the mechanism for injury and illness is compl ex 
and multifactorial  (Clifton et al. , 2016) . Rarely can the mechanism of injury or illness be 
identified by exploring variables in isolation (Edouard and Ford 2020).  This is 
particularly true of an endurance sport like swimming where the training load  demands 
are often cited as a reason for maladaptation to occur (Mujika , 2017). However, while the 
training demands can be repetitive, they are also very systematic and are planned with 
care and attention in the elite setting. In this case, while there was large variability 
between the participants training load s, the structure of their weekly train ing plan 
remained largely stable,  and the standard deviation of the weekly volume was relatively 
small. T his may indicate that  environmental reasons may be responsible as to  why the 
training load  metrics were not associated with medical attention injury and illness. The 
cohort selected were training in an elite environment with consistent coaching staff and 
support practitioners over the two -year period. This stable and high level of support and 
input  leads  to a robust training culture being impleme nted. This is evidenced and 
supported by the training load  data which is best illustrated in Figure 6-2 and Figure 6-3. 
These data suggest  that the participant training  programmes did not have large 
fluctuations and were balanced  in their prescription when anecdotally compared with 
other swim training environments. Also, the manageable participant numbers in the 
training centres suggest that coaches should be able to combi ne the “art” and “science” 
of coaching to determine when their athletes were at risk of injury and illness through 
external stressors or training load  management. As suggested in Barry et al.,  (2023) 
coaches typically use training load  monitoring systems as  a warning or communication 
tool. Typically, training load  information is used to aid decision making and is used 
alongside all key information from the multidisciplinary team. In this instance, a lack of 
association within this cohort could be as a result  of appropriate and intuitive training 
load management from the coaches and an ability to tolerate the training demands by the 
athletes. At this elite level, coaches can observe and plan their athletes training 
programmes  very accurately  creating an  environment where minor adjustments can be 
made regularly throughout the training session, training week, or cycle. This could reduce 
the likelihood of injury or illness occurring or at least reduce the severity of injury or 
illness to a non -medical atten tion issue and may relate to the lack of association found 
within the study analyses. This may not be the case in a less elite environment where the 
training structure is less consistent with less attention on the individual plan of the athlete , 
138 
 potentiall y leading to inappropriate load management.  The use of training load  
monitoring of this nature could be more useful in a club environment where potentially 
the number of athletes to coaches is much greater, session attendance is more variable 
week -to-week and individualised planning is not as commonplace. Despite these fin dings, 
the use of this training load  monitoring system is still of significant benefit to coaches by 
determining the athlete’s individual response to the training stimulus. Based on these 
findings, coaches could limit attempts to predict injury and illness through intensive 
monitoring practices and increase their focus on individualised monitoring for improved 
training and performance outcomes. They can also modify any risk adverse training load  
strategies that may have been implemented based on previous res earch conducted in other 
sports (Gabbett 2016). Individualised training load  management and performance 
improvements were seen as the principal reasons coaches used training load  monitoring 
in a recent survey of international swim coaches (Barry et al. , 2022). In the practical 
environment, training load  monitoring can be successfully used  as part of  good training 
load management practices. Ultimately, utilising these monitoring tools to identify the 
competition loads for athletes and help coaches prepare for them a dequately is a 
significant benefit. They can also be employed to compare the planned versus actual loads 
the coaches prescribed against  what the athlete experienced and t hus creat ing more 
individualised plans for athletes (West et al. , 2020).  
6.6 Limitations  
A lim itation of this study based on the findings could be the participant sample size. 
Future research should look to increase the sample size or the number of subsequent 
seasons of observation. However, it must be noted that in an elite sporting context 
conduc ting research over two seasons on a sample size  of 32 athletes is atypical and 
should be seen as a strength of this study. To further expand the number of injuries and 
illnesses collected , the definition could be expanded to include non -medical attentio n 
events. This could increase the number of events and potentially strengthen the logistic 
regression models conducted. However, the inclusion o f non-medical attention injuries 
increase s the burden on the MDCs or coaches  to collect greater amounts of data and 
decrease s the accuracy of the event diagnosis on record. The transferability of this study 
is also a potential limitation that must be acknowledged. The principles of the study 
design are transferable, but only to environments where the resources are a vailable (e.g., 
training load  data collection system, MDCs , etc.) It must also be noted that the findings 
139 
 are less transferable to a population of lower or higher ability, or to training programmes 
who employ vastly different training programme philosophies.    
6.7 Practical Application  
This study highlights the practical application of a training load  monitoring and 
injury/illness surveillance system in a competitive swimming environment. The methods 
applied illustrate to researchers and p ractitioners how to accurately implement such a 
system but also highlight the challenge in  solely using training load  monitoring to help in 
the prevention of medical attention injury and illness. The results of this study show that 
using training load  metri cs such as Weekly Pool Volume (km), 4 -week Rolling Pool 
Volume (km), Weekly Total Load Training (AU), 4 -week Rolling Total Training Load 
(AU)  and ACWR will not definitively inform decision making when trying to prevent 
medical attention injury and illness. With this in mind, coaches should acknowledge that 
preventing injuries and illness is a multifactorial process and no single metric can predict 
an adverse event. Instead, coaches should rely on these metrics to plan and prepare 
athletes’ training programmes as effectively as possible. It also suggests that coaches can 
streamline their training load  monitoring data outputs to include metrics which h elp them 
compare, organise,  and plan training load  prescription and periodisation with a more 
holistic and athlete centred mindset. Practitioners in youth or development setting should 
look to embrace these training load  monitoring practices, particularly when coach to 
athlete ratios are not optimal or during high-risk training scenarios such as integrating a 
new athlete or transitioning from a club to collegiate programme. This was highlighted in 
Wolf et al.,  (2009)  the collegiate swimming population are at increased risk of injury in 
the first twelve months of joining a varsity swim team . This is likely due to the transition 
from high -school or club swimming coupled with a sudden increase in training demands, 
followe d by acclimatisation in those that do not drop out of the sport. In these cases,  if 
both club and collegiate settings had sRPE based training load monitoring methods in 
place the athlete could transfer from one setting to another with a training load passp ort. 
This training load passport would detail their training load history and infor m future 
coaches of their training load capabilities, reducing the risk during the transition period. 
Future practitioners should look to integrate these training l oad monitoring practices to 
safeguard for healthy and evidence -based training prescription and periodisation 
programmes and adopt these processes where training prescription and athlete 
management is a concern.

Applications, and Conclusions

 7.1 Discussion  
The aim s of this programme of research w ere to  (1) explore best practice in monitoring 
training load , injury,  and illness surveillance in competitive swimming environments  and 
(2) Investigate the relationships between training load and injury and illness in 
competitive swimmers.  The research also sought to explore  the barriers and limitations 
associated with monitoring training load and conducting injury/illness surveillance in this 
population and  in real-world training environments.  Consequently, it was essential to 
implement a research -driven  prospective data collection process  which was immersed in 
best-practice  research . Ultimately, this programme of research  provide s a basis for 
inform ing future injury/illness prevention guidelines  and training load and injury/illness 
surveillance practices within competitive swimming.  
This c hapter s ynthesises  the key findings of this programme of research . The construction 
and direction  of this body of research are discussed  in relation to three prominent themes . 
The themes:  methodological considerations and recommendations, the relationship 
between training load and injury and illness and the importance of illness surveillance  
are presented and discussed  individually but are intricately linked . This chapter also  
presents the strengths of the research and highlights the limitations involved. The 
practical applications and recommendations for future research are also  outlined .   
7.1.1 Methodological Considerations and Recommendations  
Conducting a systematic review of the  literature related to  training load and pain, injury 
and illness was a crucial initial step in the design of this body of research. Despite the 
relationship between training load, injury and illness being the aim of this programme of 
research, the inclus ion of pain within the systematic review was a critical component. 
This decision was fundamentally based on previous research, the nature of the sport and 
the design of the systematic review search strategy. Previous research has included 
broader terms wit hin systematic reviews to account for the nature of prevalence -based 
definitions for overuse injuries which are recorded using athlete -reported symptomology 
(Drew and Finch 2016) . In the case of Drew and Finch (2016) the term ‘soreness’ was 
included in the search strategy to include studies with a less traditional injury definition. 
This ideology relates strongly with the recording of overuse injuries in endurance sports 
where pain may be the primary symptom with secondary impairment and disability (Bahr 
2009) . The inclusion of studies f ocusing on overuse injuries or pain in this research was 
a vital element and therefore adding the term pain, alongside injury and illness was a 
142 
 prudent decision. Exploratory searches conducted using solely injury and illness terms 
yielded a narrow view of the research involved. The addition of the term pain (and its 
synonyms) broadened the search and gave a more extended view of the topic under 
investigation. This decision proved essential when the final results showed that pain was 
most frequently explored  out of the 15 studies included in the original analysis.  
The systematic review highlighted that pain was a key term used within swimming 
research. It also discussed pain in an applied setting where it was found to be a common 
condition in the training en vironment (Hibberd and Myers 2013) . A study investigating 
shoulder pain in club swimming found t hat 72% of swimmers use pain medication to 
continue training (Hibberd and Myers 2013) . With this in mind, the systematic review 
noted that using a traditional time loss injury definition may mask and under -report the 
true impact of such pain/injuries (Bahr 2009) . A key recommendation from the systematic 
review highlighted the need for research of this nature to be aligned with injury and illness 
consensus guidelines. Creating consistency in the study designs by aligning with the 
FINA/IOC consensus guidelines was an important thread throughout this pro gramme  of 
research. An integral step in the process was  selecting the most appropriate injury and 
illness definition. Encompassing an injury definition which would be sport specific to 
swimming and attend to the complexities surrounding the overuse injuries and the 
common presence of pain was of paramount importance. Both the FINA (Mountjoy et 
al., 2016)  and IOC (Bahr et al. , 2020)  injury definitions were considered at great length. 
Importantly, both definitions include d terminology which would allow overuse injuries 
and general physical complaints from the athlete to be captured adequately. However, the 
very specific nature of the FINA definition (Mountjoy et al. , 2016)  which directed that 
the physical complaint or observable damage to the body had to occur during participation 
in training or competing in aquatic disciplines was thought to be a limitation. Employing 
this definition would narrow the type of injury capture d to those which specifically 
occurred during training or competition and would neglect to capture those that reportedly 
occurred outside of this environment but were considered to be a direct result of training 
load. Subsequently, the decision was made to  incorporate  the IOC injury definition which 
was described as a more inclusive definition  in Bahr et al.,  (2020)  and could be further 
subcategorised as medical attention, time loss or occurring (directly, indirectly or not at 
all related) due to participat ion in training or competition (Bahr et al. , 2020) .  
A secondary recommendation from the  systematic review , which was directly tied to the 
FINA consensus statement , was the use of symptom -based reporting through the OSTRC 
143 
 questionnaire. The consensus statement highlighted that the use of a health problems 
questionnaire would help with prospec tive monitoring of athletes out of competition 
environments. This questionnaire has been validated for use with swimming populations 
(Clarsen et al. , 2014)  and is designed to allow for  athlete self-report ing of health problems 
as well as  detailed information on the injury and illness  (Mountjoy et al. , 2016) . This 
recommendation was trialled during the prospective data collection familiarisation period 
where the athletes were directed to complete the OSTRC questionnaire at the end of each 
training week. However, the athletes reported th at having an additional questionnaire to 
complete alongside their daily monitoring system ( Kitman LabsTM), was overly 
burdensome and the NGB, supported by the coaches and athletes requested it not be 
included in the prospective injury and illness surveilla nce process. This decision was 
made with consideration to the findings in Chapters three and four. Both chapters 
explored the barriers associated with implementing a training load monitoring and injury 
surveillance system. Engagement from the NGB, coaches and wider MDT were all 
discernible barriers when implementing an effective training load and injury surveillance 
system. Chapter two highlights that the successful implementation of a training load 
monitoring system is directly associated with end user eng agement (Neupert et al., 2019) , 
with the goal of reducing the level of burden on those within the data collection processes.  
A key discussion point withi n the systematic review was the type of training load metrics 
being employed within competitive swimming research. A large focal point of the 
discussion centred on the over -reliance o n external training load metrics to monitor and 
present training load. Mu ch of the research discussed external training load in terms of 
session duration, session distance or session frequency. Despite the common thread of 
external training load being utilised, the metrics were expressed in a wide variety of 
ways /units  (hours/w eek, km/week, hours/session, km/session, practices/week, km/year, 
hours/year).  This lack of consistent reporting rendered the ability to make comparisons 
between the training load presented in each study difficult and negated the ability to 
conduct a meta -analysis to support the systematic review. Subsequently, the systematic 
review put forward  several future study recommendations. Firstly, as per the consensus 
guidelines on training load monitoring in athletes (Bourdon et al. , 2017) , a combination 
of internal and external training load should be employed. This is crucial when exploring 
the athlete’s response to training load as only an internal training load variable can 
provide the necessary information. It is also of critical import ance when investigating the 
relationship between training load and injury and illness. Bourdon et al., (2017) 
144 
 summated that an integrated approach to training load monitoring is important as no 
single marker of an athlete ’s response to load can consistently  predict maladaptation 
(Soligard et al., 2016) .  Therefore , internal and external  training  load should be monitored 
in combination to provide greater insight (Bourdon et al., 2017) . Bourdon et al.,  (2017) 
also recommended that objective and subjective tools should be employed to ensure an 
equal balance between athlete perception and quantifiable practice. Based on these 
recommendations, the systematic review discussed the use of the sRPE method of 
monitoring training load. Th is method combines an external and objective measure of 
training load (session duration in minutes) and the internal and subjective metric sRPE to 
create a numeric representation of the overall load of the session (sRPE -TL). Each  chapter 
outlined the value  of sRPE in training load monitoring and have summarised the many 
ways it has been employed in the research across different  sports. However, the 
systematic review uncovered its underutilisation in competitive swimming res earch as 
only one study (of low quality) (Tomar and Allen 2019)  used this method. This finding 
was subsequently explored in more detail,  and it was hypothesised that while the sRPE 
method was underutilised in competitive swimming research, it may be more frequently 
employed in a pr actical setting. Chapter three was designed to explor e how data collection 
and analysis are being implemented and what measures are considered effective  in a 
practical setting . The barriers and facilitators to training load monitoring were also 
examined. A key finding of Chapter three was the widespread implementation of both 
internal and external training load marker s and the high prevalence of sRPE as an internal 
training load measure . This is in direct contrast to the findings of Chapter two. These 
oppos ing findings highlighted a research - practice gap where it is evident that research 
practices in competitive swimming need to follow best practice and applied practices in 
relation to training load monitoring.  
Additionally, the systematic review highligh ted the need to investigate the links between 
training load and the incidence of injury and illness in an elite swimming population using 
sRPE in a longitudinal prospective cohort study. This recommendation is directly tied to 
the need to adhere to strong methodological study designs and the consensus guidelines. 
The systematic review highlighted that similar to the large variation in training load 
methods employed, the operational definitions for injury and illness also had substantial 
inconsistencies. Inj ury and illness definitions were often based on the principle of  time 
loss, restriction of training (Tomar and Allen 2019)  or medical attention (Ristol ainen et 
al., 2014) . As discussed previously in Chapter four, w hile the use of this terminology is 
145 
 appropriate and common place in many sports, they have limitations when applied to 
sports such as swimming, where few traditional  time loss injuries occur  (Bahr 2009) . 
Based on previous fi ndings regarding the research practice gap within the monitoring of 
training load, it was imperative that a similar investigation was conducted into the 
collection of injury surveillance data in a practical and competitive swimming 
environment. This was co nducted through an international survey of injury surveillance 
practices as presented in Chapter four. The findings showed that in most cases either the 
FINA (Mountjoy et al., 2016)  or IOC (Soligard et al.  2017)  definition of injury was 
employed, with a small percentage of responders using custom definitions. This was a 
positive finding as it showed that sport specific definitions have largely been employed. 
However , there was still an element of v ariation in the applied setting. The importance of 
this finding was discussed in Chapter four, where responders highlighted that they were 
not collecting this data for research purposes. Given that research is not a priority within 
these environments, an i njury definition that is consistent, and appropriate, over an 
extended period of time, may be more suitable, than what is currently used within the 
literature . The survey did reveal that the goals of injury surveillance were primarily “to 
keep a record for  insurance purposes”, “to analyse in relation to other training factors”, 
“to inform appropriate athlete training prescription” and/or “to highlight trends in injury 
occurrence”.    
The international survey  presented in Chapter four  also highlighted that only half of the 
responders conducted further analysis on the data after collection.  Where further analysis 
was conducted, injury prevalence, injury incidence, injury per training exposure and 
injuries related to stroke or event were mostly employed. Interes tingly, the consensus 
guidelines focused largely on the methodology of injury and illness surveillance and did 
not expand into how to handle the data after the collection phase. The consensus statement 
provided guidelines on how to report data through inci dence and prevalence and briefly 
stated that assessment of risk factors should be included in the injury and illness 
surveillance projects to facilitate the development of preventative interventions 
(Mountjoy et al. , 2016) . The objective of the statement was to enhance athlete health and 
performance through improved quality of injury/illness surveillance data collection and 
to aid the development of preventative measures. Based on these findings, it seems that 
those within a practical environment would benefit from additional guidance on how best 
to progress from the data collection phase. Additional detail on how to collect and analyse 
the data in relation to additional risk factors and subsequently monitor and inform injur y 
146 
 prevention strategies would be beneficial. Chapter four highlighted this key finding and 
suggested that  the publication of guidelines which outlined  how to best integrate multiple 
monitoring systems in a practical environment may not only improve the sta ndard of 
injury surveillance findings but also potentially improve the effectiveness  of injury 
prevention interventions .  Chapter five and six sought to address this recommendation by 
describing the design and implementation of an integrated monitoring sys tem and 
subsequently using the system for a two -year training load and injury/illness observation 
period. The system was designed and implemented with specific attention to the barriers 
and facilitators  highlighted by practitioners working within competiti ve swimming  and a 
crucial end -user evaluation process being performed after year one as recommended by 
WHO (200 1) and Yeomans et al., (2019). An key finding within the end -user evaluation 
was that coaches deemed athlete wellbeing ( sleep duration an d quality ) metrics  more 
important than sRPE when trying to understand what key metrics they felt best 
represented their athletes’ ability to train as planned .  This is an interesting finding a s the 
survey findings emphasised that a  significant percentage o f coaches collected sRPE data 
(second only to weekly/daily distance (m or km)). It was also noted that coaches only 
found training load monitoring to be moderately effective in relation to preventing injury 
and informing training prescription.  This identifies a key issue in the training load 
monitoring process. Despite critical data being collected, confidence in its application to 
inform injury prevention and training prescription is apparently low. This may be driven 
by a host of conflicting evidence in other sports as to the accuracy of a relationship 
between training load and injury and illness (Drew and Finch 2016; Eckard et al. , 2018) . 
A pivotal step in this process was to explore the r elationship between commonly used 
measures of training load and the incidence of injury and illness in competitive 
swimming.  
The comparison of injury and illness data to previous research is problematic  as the injury 
and illness operational definitions us ed, and the training load methods employed, are not 
consistent. However, Trikha et al.,  (2022) outlined musculoskeletal injuries and illness 
contracted by NCAA swimmers . Their findings have some similarities , and it can be 
assumed that the population would  be of a similar standard. Trikha et al.,  (2022) found 
shoulders to be the most common body part injured in their study, with  injuries to the  
spine/back and knee also being relatively common. Only 17.3% of the collegiate 
swimmers were impacted by injury at  any point during a season. However, of those that 
did get injured, 50.4% of them occurred in pool training, 13.5% in the weight room and 
147 
 3.9% during competition. This pattern has also been observed by Soligard et al.,  (2017) 
who reported a higher incidenc e of injury in training than in competition. The injury 
profile outlined in Chapter six also found shoulders to be the most common location of 
injury, followed by lumbar and ankle.  Some similarities were evident  regarding the 
distribution of where injuries we re occurring. The pool training environment accounted 
for almost half of the injuries in both instances, but there was a divergence in dryland or 
S&C related activities. In contrast, this programme  of res earch  illustrated a much higher 
occurrence  of injuries during S&C a ctivities and while a comparison on the type, amount, 
intensity of training load being applied in Trikha et al.,  (2022) is not possible, it should 
be a consideration for future seasons in the present cohort.  
The presentation of training load information a longside injury and illness epidemiological 
data is a critical part of broadening the understanding of the aetiology of injury and illness. 
The comparison of Trikha et al.,  (2022) and the findings of the longitudinal study 
highlight that a lack of training load exposure data has limited the context of the 
information available and diminished the transferability of the findings. This was a 
finding also previously discussed , where two injury surveillance studies (Matsuura et al., 
2020; Boltz et al., 2021)  presente d high quality injury data, but limited training load 
exposure data. Matsuura et al., (2019) calculated incidence rates as the number of events 
per competing athlete and per 100 athletes by body part over the course of the whole study 
period. Boltz et al., (2021) did not calculate incidence rates but instead opted for the rate 
per 1000 athlete exposures (AE). Scheduled team practice and competition were 
considered a reportable exposure for analysis. The authors described an AE in this case 
was one athlete p articipating in one exposure event  (Boltz et al. , 2021) . The FINA 
consensus statement has recommended the reporting of incidence rates as the number of 
new injuries/illnesses per 100 athletes, per 1000 athletes exposures, or per 1000 athlete -
days or per 1000 h ours of exposure  (Mountjoy et al. , 2016) . Practically, applying these 
incidence rates or exposure data to a competitive swimming environment is not always 
transferable or quantifiable. Research has presented swimming incidence rates in relation 
to swim distance. Walker et al.,  (2012) stated that  shoulder injury rates occurred at a rate 
of 0.2 to 0.3 injuries per 1000 km of swimming. However, they also presented the data as 
recommended by the FINA consensus guidelines as 0.9 injuries per 1000 hours (Walker 
et al. , 2012) . This method of presenting both pieces of information may be considered 
both academically and practically beneficial for future research. Similarly, with the high 
frequency of training load being expressed a s sRPE -TL in a practical environment as 
148 
 discussed in Chapter three expressing injury incidence rates per 1000AU could be of 
benefit to the applied setting.   
7.1.2 The Relationship between Training Load and Injury and Illness  
An important  aspect  of this research  was exploring  the relationship  between  training  load 
(using the sRPE method) , injury  and illness in a competitive swimming population. The 
final study outlines the analysis of two seasons (104 weeks) of trai ning load and medical 
attention injury/illness surveillance data. The aim of the study was to explore the 
relationship between training load and injury and illness in this cohort. Even though the 
integrated training load and injury/illness surveillance sys tem outlines the collection of 
athlete self -reported physical complaints, non -medical attention injury/illness and 
medical attention injury/illness, it was decided to solely investigate the medical attention 
injury/illness data. Medical attention injury/il lness data was considered the most robust 
data as each diagnosis was confirmed by a physiotherapist. These results are outlined in 
detail in Chapter six . The findings show that the low confidence that coaches have in the 
ability of training load (as suggested in Chapter s three and five) to prevent injury is 
justified. Training load expressed as Weekly Pool Volume (km), 4 -week Rolling Pool 
Volume (km), Weekly Total Load Training (AU) and 4 -week Rolling Total Training 
Load (AU)  and ACWR was found to have no associat ion with either injury or illness. 
This finding is consistent, irrespective of a 7 -day time lag or a 0 -day time lag.  This finding 
could be due to a host of reasons, with particular emphasis on the training environment 
being invest igated. The training load demands of the National Centres investigated are 
presented in Chapter six. The average weekly volume across the two seasons  was 33.5 ± 
12.9 km. Meanwhile, t he weekly total training load (AU) averaged 3,838 ± 1,616.1 AU, 
with 85% o f that load coming from swimming.  Anecdotally, this would be considered a 
very measured training exposure for athletes of a national and international level in the 
world of swimming. This average weekly volume may be influenced by the variety of 
swim event s (distance and stroke) of the included athletes. Largely, the cohort included 
sprinters and middle -distance swimmers, with the majority of the swimmers specialising 
in distances of 400m or less. This distribution of events would suggest the average weekly  
volume may be lower due to the inclusion of sprinters and not long -distance (800 -1500m) 
swimmers. However, despite this observation, it is apparent that the training philosophy 
of the National Centres was not centred on a volume based approach (Nugent et al. , 2017) . 
An abundance of research suggests that the high frequency of training (Weldon and 
Richardson 2001) , as well as the repetitive moti on (Pink and Tibone 2000)  can predispose 
149 
 swimmers to symptoms of overtraining (Khodaee et al., 2016) . Figure 6-2 and Figure 
6-3 illustrate the mean weekly swim volume and mean total training load over the 
observation period. Interestingly, both figures present training patterns which are cyclical 
in nature and have an  undulating form. This may highlight that the planning of the training 
loads in these elite environments are systematic  in nature  and are planned with care and 
attention. Chapter six highlights that  there was large variability between the swimmers’  
trainin g load s. This may suggest a highly individualised approach to planning the weekly 
training loads. At this elite level, coaches can observe and plan their athletes training 
plans very accurately , potentially creating an environment where minor adjustments c an 
be made regularly. This could reduce the likelihood of injury and illness occurring or at 
least reduce the severity of injury and illness to a non -medical attention issue and may 
relate to the lack of association found within th is body of work . 
One aspect  of the findings of Chapter six relates to the exploration of the ACWR and its 
relationship with injury and illness. The findings in Chapter six found no association with 
ACWR and medical attention injury and illness. This finding was consistent regardless 
of a 0 -day or 7 -day time lag. The concept of using ACWR in this population has not been 
well examined with only one study (Tomar and Allen 2019) investigating its applicability 
to injury included in Chapter two. This study has been discussed at length , with the 
discussion highlighting the study flaws related to very low sample size, short observation 
period, a very low number of injuries and low absolute training load  in comparison to 
other studies of this nature.  However, it also must be not ed that the authors chose to 
employ the ACWR rolling average method which has been described as less sensitive by 
Griffin et al.,  (2020a). Collette et al.,  (2018) also investigated the use of ACWR but with 
the more sensitive EWMA approach in a swimming pop ulation but found that it was a 
less valid measure than the Acute Recovery and Stress Scale (ARSS) to monitor the 
recovery – stress continuum in athletes. Unfortunately, this study did not collect 
injury/illness surveillance data. It has been discussed tha t in individual sports, like 
swimming, the use of a measure like ACWR is not as applicable due to the periodisation 
strategies applied to the competition calendar (Boullosa et al. , 2020 ). Team sport 
competition calendars tend to be dense in nature with frequent competitions throughout 
the year resulting in time restricted workload accumulation periods and no true peaking 
events (Boullosa et al. , 2020) . This is contrasted with individual sports where there are 
prolonged periods of loading with less frequent tapering and peaking events. These 
tapering and peaking events are commonly associated with periodisation models and 
150 
 modern elite training environme nts have adopted the multifactorial approach of 
periodising not only training load but also recovery, psychology support, dietetics and 
skill acquisition (Boullosa et al. , 2020) . The se individual sport principles and practices 
have reduced the value of a metric like ACWR being necessary to avoid sudden changes 
in load and subsequent increased risk of injury and illness. This would link directly in 
with the suggestion that the training environment, culture, and philosophies of the 
National Centres could have impacted the association between training load and 
injury /illness  as discussed in Chapter six . This issue has been highlighted previously 
where Carey et al., (2018) suggested that an alysis of this nature needs a higher proportion 
of injury/illness events to non -events to provide a strong model . The study suggested that 
future research needs to increase the number and variety of predictors or greatly increase 
the number of observations  and potential injury data by elongating the observation period 
to greater than ten seasons (Carey et al. , 2018) . However, it  cannot be assumed  that by 
elongating the observation period in elite sporting settings that the proportion of 
injury/illness events to non -events would change.  
7.1.3 The Importance of Illness Surveillance  
The exploration of illness within competitive swimmers was a pivotal aspe ct of this 
programme of research. The illness profile of a swimmer has been less well established 
than the injury profile. The exploration of the influence of training load as a risk factor 
for illness has also not been as well explored in this population. The systematic review 
documented only one study (Hellard et al., 2015)  which investigated the relationship 
between training and illness. This study  quantified training load in meters per week at 
each intensity, determined by a blood lactate step test detailed by Mujika et al., (1996) . 
A positive relationship was discovered with periods of high training loads ( OR 1.10, 95% 
CI 1.01 – 1.19;  p = 0.0244) increasing the odds of illness by 50 -70%. Unfortunately, as 
this odds ratio is related to a small effect size (Sullivan and Feinn 2012)  and was not 
supported by additional literature, the positive rel ationship was characterised as being 
found with limited evidence  and should be interpreted with caution . The review 
highlighted the need for illness to be included in future research, as per the FINA 
consensus statement by Mountjoy et al.,  (2016).  
Research has shown that swimmers regularly tra in and compete with persistent health 
problems (Prien et al. , 2017) . This research  has outlined that significant immune 
deficiencies are not commonplace in swimming, but minor illnesses such as URTIs occur 
151 
 more frequently (Hellard et al. , 2015) . The pulmonary issues in swimming are thought to 
be related to regular exposure of chemical compounds in the swimming environment 
coupled with the training load associated with the sport  (Khodaee et al. , 2016) . The high 
incidence of URTIs was also seen in collegiate swimming at NCAA Division I level 
(Trikha et al. , 2022) . This study analysed the injury/illness surveillance data for 641 
collegiate swim mers over four seasons. The findings showed that 24.3% of all illnesses 
were recorded as URTIs over the observation period and that URTIs were the most 
common non -musculoskeletal issue experienced (Trikha et al. , 2022) . The authors agreed 
with Khodaee et al.,  (2016) and summarised that the high prevalence of URTIs was due 
to intense training in a chlorinated environment, vitamin D deficiency being common in 
this population,  or sustained variations in ventilation during sport , affecting the airway 
epithelium  (Trikha et al. , 2022) . The authors also c oncluded with the recommendation 
that routine screening procedures for these respiratory illnesses should be considered 
which is in line with guidance from Mountjoy et al.,  (2016) . This illness profile was 
similar to what was seen through the 104 -week obse rvation period  within this programme 
of research . A total of 60 medical attention illnesses were recorded  with respiratory illness 
being most prevalent. Taking COVID -19 diagnosis aside, URTIs (21.7%) were the most 
common illness contracted by the swimmers. Seasonal differences were not statistically 
analysed; however, Figure 6-2 and Figure 6-3 showed that the frequency of illness 
increased above two incidences per week on five separate  occasions. Three of these 
occasions were during the winter months (December -February), with one occasion 
occurring in late autumn (October -November). One occasion was in week 87 (April) and 
while this was not during the winter months, it was only a one -week spike which was less 
than the rest of the occasions (average of 4.75 weeks). This finding is in accordance with 
Hellard et al.,  (2011), who noted that there was a higher risk of infection during the winter 
period, which they defined as September to Marc h. They concluded that the winter period, 
coupled with intensive periods of training would lower the athletes’ ability to resist viral 
or non -viral pathogens which naturally surge during the winter months (Hellard et al. , 
2011) . This pattern was also echoed by Hellard et al.,  (2015) who found that URTPIs 
were 2.62 times higher during the winter months. The severity of illnesses in the 
longitudinal study was considered generally mild to moderate, which is higher tha n that 
of the injury severity which was largely described as mild. This increased severity of 
illness in comparison to injury adds weight to the need for adequate illness surveillance 
and robust investigation into the risk factors associated with it.  
152 
 The systematic review did not unearth the same methodological limitations for the 
collection and reporting of illness as was discovered with injury. This is due to a lack of 
research as opposed to  the methodological issues being present. The design and 
impleme ntation of the integrated training load monitoring and injury and illness 
surveillance system  has previously been described . The illness surveillance procedures 
within this chapter were largely driven by the FINA and IOC consensus guidelines. The 
system wa s designed to collect time loss and non -time loss illness as well as medical 
attention and non -medical attention illness. Illness was classified as communicable or 
non-communicable, with a series of subcategories to provide additional context to the 
illnes s record as outlined in Chapter five. The evaluation of this system after one year of 
data collection was a critical step in the implementation process. End -users were asked to 
evaluate the system and provide recommendations for its evolution in accordance  with 
the WHO injury and illness surveillance guidelines (World Health Organization 2001) . A 
key finding in the evaluation process was the collection of accurate illness information 
was deemed  as a challenge for the MDCs. The National Centre structures involved did 
not have direct access to a sports medicine doctor for all levels of athletes within their 
tiered system. Athletes of a lower tier often used a personal general practitioner for issues 
needing medical attention  resulting in the subsequent diagnosis being relayed back to the 
MDCs by the athlete. A secondary issue related to non -medical attention illness ( “stuff 
above the throat…head cold, or maybe some mild GI symptoms”). MDCs regu larly 
received delayed and second -hand information from the coach regarding these issues. 
Despite there being more illness recorded than injuries throughout the observation period, 
the MDCs suggested that these barriers may have led to an under -reporting o f illness in 
the first year of data collection. The MDCs recommended that future systems should have 
adequate personnel to diagnose these issues for all levels of athlete or in the absence of 
adequate medical support, symptom -based reporting by the individ ual athlete may be the 
preferred reporting avenue. This action item was considered  for year two of illness 
surveillance, where similar to injury reporting an athlete illness self -reporting option was 
added to their daily monitoring system.   
The longitudinal data collection took place from September 2020 to September 2022 , 
which was throughout the COVID -19 pandemic. The recording of illness during this 
period took an unexpected level of importance in elite sport, which otherwise may have 
been of secondary importance to injury surveillance in previous research. For context, 
during season one (September 2020 -August 2021) a severe  level of restrictions w as in 
153 
 place enforcing significant  athlete isolation from the general population and normal daily  
activities. These restrictions were largely removed in season two and a large por tion of 
the athlete population returned to unrestricted school or college and activities of daily 
living. A total of 122 illnesses were recorded throughout the observation pe riod; however, 
only 26 .2% of them occurred in season one. The remainder occurred during season two 
showing an imbalance in the distribution of illnesses. Two things may have impacted this 
increase in illness incidence. Firstly, the addition of a self -repor ted illness pathway for 
athletes after the end -user evaluation process may have improved the reporting pathway 
and increased the number of reports to the MDCs. Secondly, the government restrictions 
in season one followed by the easing of restrictions in se ason two potentially created an 
initial decrease and then subsequent increase in illness in this population. A similar effect 
was demonstrated in Israel, where social restrictions were associated with a significant 
decrease in infectious diseases, while th e easing of restrictions were met with an increase 
of non–SARS -CoV -2 respiratory  and gastrointestinal  infections  (Amar et al. , 2022) . 
However,  as the illness  surveillance  process  only began  in September  2020  there  are no 
baseline  data to make  a comparison  to in this Irish popula tion. Therefore,  the rational e 
for the imbalanced  distribution  is merely  hypothetical  and provides  further  support  for 
the continuous  and longitudinal  prospective  monitoring  of these  populations.  
Research Summary  
7.1.4 Key Findings  
The key findings of this programme of researc h are presented in depth in each individual 
chapter. These findings are summarised as follows:  
7.1.4.1  Study 1  
A systematic review of the literature found no clear evidence of a relationship between 
training load and pain in competitive swimmers, while there is li mited and conflicting 
evidence to suggest a relationship between training load and injury and illness. External 
training load methods were most frequently employed in the research, with internal 
training load measures rarely featuring. The ability to synth esise the data within the 
review was hampered by study design, inconsistent training load monitoring methods, 
large population classification differences and varying operating definitions of pain, 
injury,  and illness.  
154 
 7.1.4.2  Study 2  
An international survey inves tigating training load monitoring practices used by 
competitive swimming practitioners and coaches found that monitoring practices are 
centred on an athlete’s response to training and improving performance. Injury prevention 
is considered less of a priorit y, with research purposes not being a consideration. 
Practitioners frequently employed both internal and external measures of training load, 
which highlights a disparity  between the methods used within the research environment 
and in an applied setting. To optimise the implementation of a training load monitoring 
system, stakeholder buy -in and financial, personnel and technological resources need to 
be considered and addressed.  
7.1.4.3  Study 3  
An international survey investigating the injury surveillance practices  used by 
practitioners and coaches found that injury surveillance was carried out less frequently 
than training load monitoring in competitive swimming environments. Regarding those 
that did employ injury surveillance practices, only half of them conducted  further analysis 
on the data after it was collected. This is linked to the primary goal of data collection 
which was to keep a record for insurance purposes and like study two, using the data for 
research purposes was a minor consideration.  
7.1.4.4  Study 4  
This study outline d how to integrate both IOC/FINA consensus guidelines into the design 
of the injury/illness surveillance practices. The evaluation of the system found that 
athletes noted periods of high stress were the most challenging to maintain consistent  
reporting practices. Athletes also noted that having access to their reported information 
was key to maintaining compliance and accuracy. Coaches and MDCs highlighted that 
the monitoring system was used as a communication pathway to transfer information 
from athletes to coaches and among the MDT , and that information needs to be considered 
with the athletes reporting history and reporting trends in mind. Finally, the evaluation 
process highlighted that the accurate collection of illness information was cha llenging in 
the absence of a sports medicine doctor being attached to the training environment. 
Symptom -based reporting methods, where the athlete self -reports illness information, 
may be more advantageous where resources do  not match the goals of the illn ess 
surveillance process.  
155 
 7.1.4.5  Study 5  
The prospective study was 104  weeks in duration and the final analysis included 32 
swimmers, ranging from national to world class level. Injury and illness epidemiological 
data were presented showing that illness occurren ce was greater than injury. Training load 
data highlighted that an average of 33.5 ± 12.9 km was swam each week , while swimmers 
had an average total weekly load of 3,838 ± 1,616.1 AU.  Binary logistic regression was 
employed to analyse the association betwe en training load metrics and medical attention 
injury and illness. Results showed that Weekly Pool Volume (km), 4 -week Rolling Pool 
Volume (km), Weekly Total Load Training (AU) , 4-week Rolling Total Training Load 
(AU)  and ACWR  had no association with medic al attention injury and illness. These 
findings were consistent regardless of a 0 -day or 7 -day time lag.  
7.2 Strengths and Limitations  
A significant strength of this research is its grounding in the applied setting. Chapter s 
three to six have outlined  finding s with specific involvement from the swimming 
community. Public patient involvement (PPI) in research is a means of involving people 
in all aspects of the research process as partners rather than just participants. Actively 
involving the target research pa rticipants is seen as a marker of good research practice as 
it leads to improved study design, relevancy and outcomes uptake (Blackburn et al. , 
2018) . This programme of research was designed with a PPI process in mind. The initial 
progra mme of research design was developed with three governing bodies. The 
University of Limerick acted as the academic partner, while the Irish Research Council 
was the primary funding body. Swim Ireland acted as a secondary funding source and 
was a key indust ry partner with collaboration in the research question, project design, 
participant recruitment, facilitating data collection, evaluation processes and joint 
dissemination of the research findings. Major aspects of the programme of research are 
designed wi th the  input and guidance of key stakeholders in Swim Ireland while the 
international survey provided an opportunity for the wider swimming community to share 
their lived experience. The lived experience was also a significant part of t he design, 
implement ation,  and evaluation of the system  where key proponents of the monitoring 
process were engaged in the end -user review process. This is a significant step in 
participant action research where the focus is on creating action through a data collection, 
reflection and action in a corkscrew cyc le (Baum 2006) . 
156 
 The longitudinal and prospective nature of the final study  is a crucial aspect of this 
research and elevates the strength of the body of research. Initial research  highlighted the 
lack of longitudinal, prospective research conduct ed on a truly elite sporting population. 
This was supported by Mountjoy et al.,  (2016) where they echoed the need for out of 
competition prospective injury and illness surveillance. Conducting research at elite level 
is often difficult due to the limited a ccess, numbers of athletes and ability to implement 
good research processes in the practical training environments. However, there is greater 
control and resources available at that level, with less confounding factors affecting the 
results. This study  not only included longitudinal prospective study design but was carried 
out in an elite training environment with high level swimmers and professional coaches 
and support services. This enables a high level of quality control to be maintained 
throughout the o bservation period. This research  has filled a significant gap in the 
research by adding considerable new knowledge  to the body of literature investigating 
the association between training load monitoring and injury/illness surveillance in 
competitive swimm ing.  
A key strength of this research was the stakeholder investment within the data collection 
process. The three MDCs  were all chartered physiotherapists working within Swim 
Ireland’s National Centres and had an invested inte rest in the success of the project. It has 
been shown in previous research (Wik et al., 2019)  that physiotherapists invested in the 
data collection process reported a greater number of non-time loss injuries and injuries 
with a lower severity than their non -invested counterparts. Designing injury/illness 
surveillance data collection processes with the stakeholders at the centre of the research 
design is a significant strength of this pro gramme of research. The consistency of the 
MDCs over both seasons is also a strength of the research. The same MDCs recorded the 
injury/illness surveillance data across both seasons which has been highlighted as a key 
methodological strength in surveillanc e research (Wik et al., 2019) . In a practical sporting 
environment, the turnover of staff season to season within a clinical setting can be 
expected. However, this disruption has the potential to create variability within the data 
collection process which may compromise the outcomes of an otherwise well -designed 
system.  These key strengths to the injury/illness surveillance led to very robust and 
accurate data collection processes and improved the integrity of the data and subsequently 
the research outcomes.  
A significant strength of this research was the use of an ecologically sound form of 
training load monitoring in sRPE (Wallace et al. , 2009) . However, a  limitation of this 
157 
 programme of research may be the lack of an objective internal training load measure in 
parallel with the subjective measure (sRPE) collected. Sessional rate of perceived 
exertion as a training load mea sure should be seen as good representation of the overall 
load placed on the athlete and not the physiological or biomechanical load (Coyne et al., 
2018) . The addition of an objective internal training load measure, such as heart rate 
would  provide an objective measure of the training load and compliment the subjective 
nature of sRPE, allowing quantification of both the internal (physiological) and holistic 
load on the athlete.  
Swim Ireland has a competitive swimming membership of almost 8, 000 athletes. The 
membership gender balance noted at the time of registration highlights a greater 
proportion of female competitive swimmers (58%). At the upper levels of the sport, the 
gender balance shifts towards male athletes, with 68% of centralised a thletes being male. 
As the centralised athletes were the selected population for the study in Chapter six , the 
gender balance within this project was more heavily weighted towards male athletes.  The 
Sex and Gender Equity in Research (SAGER) guidelines reco mmend that data reported 
be disaggregated by sex and gender where possible and relevant (Heidari et al., 2016) . 
Chapter six in this programme of research has not disaggregated the data as the sample 
size and unbalanced nature of the  data (69% male) suggests it would not be prudent to 
further distil down the results.  The gender balance is not seen as a limitation of this study 
as it reflects  the true centralised environment ; however,  the inability to separate the 
findings by gender, in order to  improve  the transferability of the results , could be viewed  
as a limitation.  
Research into elite sport often has to accept  limitations in sample size and the subsequent 
consequences of not detecting an effect of relevant magnitude (Skorski and Hecksteden 
2021) . The sample size  of the longitudinal  study  was impacted by not only the elite status 
of the athletes but the limited number of centralised ath letes within the Irish swimming 
performance system. To overcome this limitation, the study was designed to incorporate 
a two -year data collection which bolstered the number of available data points per athlete 
throughout the data collection.  
The data coll ection period of 2020/2021 season was largely carried out under a host of 
changing government lockdown restrictions, while 2021/2022 season was not impacted 
by government imposed COVID -19 mandates. Recent research has shown that amateur 
athletes had an inc rease in injury incidence after the lockdown period (Tond elli et al., 
158 
 2023) , while professional athletes had no increase after the lockdown period (Waldén et 
al., 2022) . The impact of illness over this time period is less well documented in the 
literature; however, one study highlighted that medical guidance surrounding illness 
during the COVID -19 pan demic created increased time -loss through the return to play 
process (Hull et al., 2022) . This may largely be down to government restrictions dictating 
athlete removal and a set isolation period at the earliest signs of illness and/or me dical 
guidelines highlighting the need for a minimum graded return to play period after 
COVID -19 infection  (Elliott et al. , 2020) . The collection of injury and illness surveillance 
data through the COVID -19 pandemic provides key information during a crucial time 
period in elite sport, however the validity of  extrapolation of the findings to less volatile 
periods i s a potential limit ation of the study .  
The i njury surveillance practices in competitive swimming  were ex plored within this 
programme of research  with the aim of informing the subsequent data collection process 
and system design. However, the authors did not gather information on the illness 
surveil lance practices of practitioners within the competitive swimming community. This 
aspect of the data collection process was largely guided by FINA and IOC consensus 
statements but was not informed through an international survey as was done with training 
load and injury monitoring processes. The addition of practitioner feedback may have 
provided further insight into the illness data collection strategy.  
7.3 Future Research Directions  
It has been shown that a research practice gap in the methods used to monitor  training 
load in competitive swimming exists. Contrary to typical research practice gaps, this 
deficit largely lies within the research associated with training load monitoring and 
injury/illness surveillance in this global sport. This programme of resear ch sought to 
bridge the gap between the academic sphere and the practical environments, however 
future research needs to build on this programme of research and key findings. 
Suggestions for future research include:  
• This programme of research has provided a best -practice framework for sport 
specific training load monitoring and injury and illness surveillance . Future 
research should  conduct similar prospective and longitudinal studies to investigate 
the relationship between training load and injury and illn ess in these competitive 
swimming populations. This would allow for greater clarity and allow for a meta -
analysis to be conducted.  
159 
 • With the benefits of a sport specific injury and illness surveillance consensus 
guidelines document, FINA should l ook to provide its stakeholders with a sport 
specific training load monitoring consensus statement which guides not only the 
training load monitoring process but also illustrates how best to integrate the 
guidelines with their injury and illness consensus statement guidelines. This 
would be of significant benefit to future researchers and help elevate the standard 
of training load monitoring practices in competitive swimming  going forward.  
• The factors that influence both injury and illness are  multifactorial  and therefore 
the scope of investigation into the relationship between training load and injury 
and illness should be broadened to include additional risk factors. This would 
include more holistic athlete data, such as daily well -being, where ear ly signs of 
negative adaption could identify  prior to an injury or illness occurring. Future 
research could also examine the influence of previous injury/illness history would 
have on the relationship between training load and injury/illness.  
• Non-medical attention injuries or illnesses as well as self -reported physical 
complaints , soreness, stiffness, discomfort could present as an early warning sign 
for a subsequent time loss event  as per Whalan et al.,  (2020) . This programme of 
research  aimed t o identify how best to collect both medical attention, non -medical 
attention,  and self -reported p hysical complaints . However, the sole focused on 
medical attention injury/illness was deemed a primary starting point for analysis. 
Future research should build on this by including a separate analysis of non -
medical attention injury/illness and pain which may inform the greater landscape 
of injury/illness incidence and burden in competitive swimming.  
• Collaboration and multicentre research has been recommended as “the 
cornerstone to future high quality sports injury research” (Nielsen et al., 2020) . 
This research has been conducted  in conjunction with key stakeholders in the 
competitive swimming community ( i.e., NGB, physiotherapists, coaches,  and 
athletes), while also integrating the expertise of academics in both sport and 
exercise science s, health,  and rehabilitation. The project  also collaborated with a n 
expert  statistician to understand the most appropriate data analysis and 
interpretation. This programme of research also involved a multicentre data 
collection process which improved the sample size. However, the population 
withi n the two national centres are largely homogeneous and were exposed to a 
relatively consistent training philosophy across both centres. Future research 
should look to expand on this collaboration and multicentre nature of this study 
160 
 to incorporate multiple  training venues with more diverse populations, training 
methods and methodologies. This diversity within the data collection could 
improve the generalisability of the research findings to a larger population of 
competitive swimmers.  
• The gender balance in  this programme of research was weighted towards male 
swimmers (69% male). This naturally occurred due to the overall gender balance 
within Swim Ireland ’s National Training Centres. The inclusion of a wider 
multicentre data collection process, including pr ogrammes outside of the Irish 
system, could potentially improve this and allow the findings to be segregated by 
gender.  
7.4 Practical Applications  
This programme of research has resulted in several findings which can be applied to the 
practical environment, w ith specific focus on both researchers and practitioners working 
in real -world settings. The practical applications are as follows:  
• The methodological considerations exposed and addressed throughout this body 
of research should guide those practitioners ca rrying out training load monitoring 
and injury/illness surveillance in an applied setting. Specifically, those wishing to 
maintain highly consistent data collection processes can use the body of research 
as a framework to act from.  
• Those wishing to implem ent a training load monitoring system should consider 
stakeholder buy -in and financial, personnel and technological resources. The 
NGB needs to be invested in the training load requirements of the programme by 
dedicating a member of staff to these services . This will aid in reducing the burden 
of the data collection process. To increase athlete adherence in the monitoring 
process, frequent, consistent,  and relevant feedback should be provided. Coach 
engagement in the process can be improved through framing the training load 
monitoring process in a more performance orientated manner. The training load 
monitoring system should prioritise the use of sRPE. In competitive swimming , 
sRPE is beneficial  as it can transcend all aspects of a modern -day swim 
programme. Dryland activities, competition and swim training load can be 
quantified utilising the same method, allowing for an accurate measure of total 
traini ng load .  
161 
 • The implementation of an injury /illness  surveillance system should be preceded 
by a strong understanding of the system goals and contrasted to the resources 
available. Where the injury /illness  surveillance outcomes are to be translated into 
resea rch, it is imperative that strict use of the consensus guidelines is employed. 
However, where research is not the objective, the requirement is to have a 
consistent and sport -specific definition longitudinally within the swim 
programme. Either the FINA (Mountjoy et al.  2016)  or IOC (Bahr et al.  2020)  
definitions are appropriate in competitive swimming. Ideally, an electronic sy stem 
for data collection should be employed to reduce the time burden of injury /illness 
surveillance and to improve the level of detail gathered. A classification system 
such as the OSCIIS is of great benefit to accurate injury and illness diagnosis, 
while  the categorisation according to their acute or repetitive nature and sub -
categorising by sudden or gradual onset would provide necessary detail.  
• Once the system has been designed and the resource needs have been met the 
implementation and data collection  procedures require a continuous end -user 
evaluation process . This  allow s for the evolution of the system to meet the 
dynamic demands of a sporting environment . The integration of the system should 
occur gradually allowing for a period of uninterrupted dat a collection where staff 
can gain a deeper understanding of individual athlete reporting habits. The system 
should act as an “alert” to potential issues, allowing the coach to instigate 
communication with the athlete  while always c onsidering the athletes r eporting 
history and personality traits before taking decisive act ion. Athlete and coach 
education into the benefits and uses of the monitoring process is necessary to 
maintain high levels of athlete compliance, however this education needs to occur 
early in the monitoring process and be continuous throughout the season. Coaches 
also need to consider the cost/benefits of treating higher tiered athletes differently 
within the monitoring process. Despite creating a flexible and individualised 
approach for certain athletes, there is a high risk of developing an adverse athlete 
culture leading to l arger and subsequent challenges.  
• The monitoring of illness needs also to be well resourced with the aim of having 
adequate medical support in place for all levels of athlete within the system. 
Where this cannot be achieved , symptom -based reporting by the individual athlete 
may be the preferred reporting option . This can be conducted using basic 
symptom reporting avenues or through the inclusion of the OSTRC questionnaire.  
162 
 • The findings of this programme of research suggest that there was no association 
between Weekly Pool Volume (km), 4 -week Rolling Pool Volume (km), Weekly 
Total Load Training (AU) and  4-week Rolling Total Training Load (AU) and 
ACWR and  medical attention in jury and illness. Practically, this finding suggests 
that those monitoring training load with a goal of predicting medical attention 
injury and illness should allocate their resources elsewhere. However, the 
practical application of this system has strengths  in being used to guide coaches’ 
periodisation plans and to compare the coaches planned training volume and 
intensity against what the athlete is subjectively experiencing. This system is also 
useful in identif ying the competition loads for athletes and he lp coaches prepare 
for them adequately.  
• At this elite level, coaches can observe and plan their athletes’  training plans with 
a high degree of accuracy and with input from the wider MDT. These minor 
adjustments can be made regularly throughout the trainin g session, training week, 
or cycle , potentially reducing  the likelihood of injury or illness occurring . This 
may not be the case in a less elite environment where the training structure is less 
consistent with less attention on the individual plan of the a thlete. The use of 
training load  monitoring could be more useful in a club environment where 
potentially the number of athletes to coaches is much greater, session attendance 
is more variable week to week and individualised planning is not as 
commonplace.  
7.5 Conclusions  
The integration of training load monitoring and injury  and illness surveillance is 
necessary to elevate the standard of athlete welfare, training practices and periodisation  
in competitive swimming.  Previously, the relationship between training load and  injury 
and illness in a competitive sw imming population was unclear due to a host of 
methodological constraints.  This programme of research  found no association  between 
sRPE derived training load  metrics and the incidence of medical attention injury and 
illness in this competitive swimming  population , over a two-year period . This lack of 
association was present , regardless of  a 0-day or 7 -day lag, suggesting  that a well-
controlled  and structured training programme minimise s the likelihood of training related 
injuries and illness.  Importantly , this programme of research  also confirmed  that sRPE as 
a training load monitoring tool  is an appro priate method of monitoring training load in 
this cohort . sRPE can be implemented effectively in a wide array of competitive 
163 
 swimming settings  (beginner  to elite) and can encompass  all the training methods used in 
a modern -day swim programme ( pool training, S&C training , cross training,  and 
competition) . Finally,  this programme of research has also identified  that i njury and 
potentially  more significantly , illness surveillance are a cr itical compon ent to moni tor 
longitudinally . Longitudinal injury  and illness surveillance in conjunction  with training 
load monitoring will pro vide for detailed information on the aetiolog y of injury and 
illness es, safeguarding  against inappropriate loading strategies.
