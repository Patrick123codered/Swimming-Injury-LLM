Introduction: The objective of this paper is to study the research trends in the
sport modality of artistic swimming and to analyse the scienti ﬁc production
regarding this sport.
Methods: Two hundred and twenty articles related to the theme were selected
after a search in the PubMed, SPORTDiscus and Web of Science databases and
some additional records, using the theme “synchronised swimming OR artistic
swimming ”up to December 2022. The variables scrutinized were the following:
(1) title, (2) discipline, (3) type, (4) sample size and (5) sporting level.
Results: The results indicate that (1) 53.6% of the artistic swimming articles were
case studies, (2) 23.2% talked about physiology, (3) 32.7% had a sample of 11 –50
participants, and (4) 30.9% of the sample was elite/international swimmers.
Discussion: Over the years there has been a considerable increase in studies on
artistic swimming; the topics of greatest interest in artistic swimming have beenphysiology, sports performance and injuries. Even so, it seems that for the
moment artistic swimming has little impact, probably due to its status as a
minority sport and it having limited social and economic impact.
KEYWORDS
bibliometrics, artistic swimming, injuries, sport, research
Introduction
Physical activity and sports sciences have experienced a huge rise in recent decades,
becoming one of the scienti ﬁc branches with the highest number of publications per year.
This has made it possible to carry out reviews and meta-analyses that compile the
greatest ﬁndings in each discipline and thus improve different areas of sports training and
injury prevention in most sports disciplines, such as football, basketball or tennis ( 1,2).
However, other sports considered minority ones have not had this level of repercussion
and therefore there is no documentation that describes all the scienti ﬁc literature and help
available to professionals in a sports area as occurs in the sport of artistic swimming.
Artistic swimming is an Olympic sport that involves swimming, dance and ballet.
Swimmers (solo, duet or team) perform a synchronised routine of elaborate movements
in and under the water, accompanied by music ( 3). Its practice requires demanding
advanced skills, such as great strength, stamina, ﬂexibility, grace, artistry and precise
synchronisation ( 3,4), but given the multidisciplinary nature of this sport ( 5), it is
necessary to know exactly the ﬁelds in which scienti ﬁc production develops.
To create a systematic review or meta-analysis on artistic swimming that allows us to
synthesise the results of different empirical studies on the effect of one or more variables
on a precise ﬁnal result, the existence of a signi ﬁcant and representative number of
investigations on the subject is necessary. As it is a minority sport with many aspects to
work on but with few resources in its facilities ( 3), artistic swimming does not arouseTYPE Original Research

great scienti ﬁc appeal and does not allow for revisions with this
level of importance. Despite this, it is an increasingly well-known
sport with a notable growth in licences in some countries, which
has allowed an increase in research in recent years that needs to
be synthesised and compiled. In addition, other tools allow the
analysis of existing research on artistic swimming, such as
bibliometric studies. Knowing and/or being able to quantify the
scienti ﬁc production of a certain area arouses great interest in
the research community, which is why bibliometric techniques
enjoy great applicability by theorists and/or scholars of any
branch of scienti ﬁc knowledge ( 6), in this way, experts in the
area consider bibliometric studies on artistic swimming as the
future result of a scienti ﬁc development that will gradually adapt
to the needs of the sport.
The creation of said documents or scienti ﬁc studies, their
analysis and the criticism carried out by the community itself are
essential to building knowledge about the research activity, thus
making the examiner ’s work credible ( 7). The analysis shows
where the researchers are focused, making clear that the
drawbacks are the main lines of action and research trends ( 6–9).
Given the absence of reviews or bibliometric studies that compile
and describe the existing literature on artistic swimming, the
main objective of this research is to perform a bibliometric
analysis of artistic swimming that allows knowing the research
trends and analysing the scienti ﬁc production regarding this sport.
Methods
Design and procedures
The bibliographic search was carried out in the PubMed, Web
of Science, and SPORTDiscus databases. Subsequently, a search for
additional resources was carried out through Google Scholar or
based on the articles from primary sources. The following
keywords in English “synchronised swimming ”and “artistic
swimming ”and “natación sincronizada ”and “natación artística ”
in Spanish were used and were combined using AND/OR
Boolean markers up to December 2022.
As inclusion criteria, all articles that included a sample of
synchronised swimming or artistic swimming athletes in any
branch of the sport in scienti ﬁc documents were selected. For the
storage and organisation of the selected studies, a database was
generated that can be obtained from the corresponding author.
Data collection and analysis
The initial search returned 537 results identi ﬁed in the PubMed
database, 1,837 results found in the SPORTDiscus database and
574 recognised results in the Web of Science database. Three
hundred and twenty-eight articles from the different platforms
were selected for a detailed evaluation of them ( n= 328). One
hundred and eight of the initial 328 studies were duplicates;
therefore, the ﬁnal study sample was 220 publications: 107 from
PubMed, 81 from SPORTDiscus, 16 from Web of Science and 16from additional sources. The ﬂow diagram of the selection of
studies for the review is shown in Figure 1 .
The following variables were recorded and analysed concerning
5 categories and 40 different subcategories within the theme: (1)
title, (2) main discipline of the study (injuries, sports
performance, physiology, physical analysis, physical analysis for
talent detection, body dissatisfaction and eating disorders,
historical data, artistic swimming technique analysis, training
theory, physical activity and health, biomechanics, doping and
other substances, psychology, nutrition, didactics and/or others),
(3) type of study (correlational, case, experimental, documentary,
longitudinal and/or descriptive), (4) sample size and (5) sporting
level of the sample (initiation, regional, national, elite/
international or several). The classi ﬁcation of the categories
associated with these variables was carried out based on the
category systems used by various authors ( 10–13).
To assess the inter-reviewer reliability of the coding process,
two researchers performed the search and coding process for the
articles. For qualitative variables, Cohen ’s kappa coef ﬁcients were
applied. On average, the Kappa coef ﬁcient was 0.86 (range: 0.81 –
0.97), which can be considered highly satisfactory. Inconsistencies
between the two coders were resolved by consensus, and when
the inconsistency was due to database ambiguity, this was
corrected. Any disagreements were resolved by mutual consent in
consultation with a third review author.
Results
AsFigure 2 shows, three periods are clearly differentiated in terms
of the evolution of the number of publications. In the ﬁrst period, from
1962 to 1979, the number of publications on artistic swimming is very
low. In the second period, from 1980 to 2004 approximately, there is a
slight increase in the number of publications (2 –11 publications per
year). And ﬁnally, in the third period from 2005 to 2022, the level
of production increases in a very notable way, reaching a maximum
level of publications in 2021 (with a total of 43 publications).
Regarding the language of publication, 210 of the 220 papers were
published in English and 10 in Spanish. Of all the information
presented, no study included male subjects.
The results shown in Table 1 show that there is a high
percentage of case studies in artistic swimming in the last almost
60 years, whose purpose is to analyse an aspect of the subject in
a single athlete or a very small sample of them (53.6%). Also
worth noting is the importance of documentary research
(selected publications on a speci ﬁc topic that analyse the
information and present it in a discussion) and conclusions, with
the second highest percentage (16.8%).
Studies on physiology are the main theme of the studies
conducted (23.1%), followed by sports performance (12.2%). A
wide range of other disciplines also provide information on
different topics but with lower percentages, such as injuries,
analysis of artistic swimming technique, physical analysis and/or
historical data ( Table 2 ).
The number of swimmers analysed in each study varies
remarkably ( Table 3 ), with a high percentage of studies that had aRincón et al. 10.3389/fspor.2023.1196144
Frontiers in Sports and Active Living 02 frontiersin.org
sample of 11 –50 participants (32.7%). Likewise, it is worth noting the
studies that do analyse subjects but do not detail how many people
the group is made up of (20% of the total articles collected). There
are few investigations with large samples since only 7.2%
correspond to studies with 51 –100 swimmers or more than 100.
As an exceptional fact, it should be noted that the study with the
largest sample is the one that was conducted by Prien et al. ( 14)
in 2017 with 1,194 participants, which analyses and compares
the results of three FINA World Championships to see the riskof injury in the competition of this sport.
In relation to the characteristics of the analysed sample
(Table 4 ), the studies with elite-level artistic swimmers represent
the highest percentage (30.9%), followed by those with a wide
variety of levels. Studies with national-level samples exist in a
much smaller proportion (7.7%). Likewise, studies with athletes
of a lower level or initiation levels are very scarce. Finally, the
high percentage of publications in which the level of the athletes
is not speci ﬁed is noteworthy.Discussion
The objective of this work was to know the research trends in the
sport modality of artistic swimming and to analyse the scienti ﬁc
production regarding this sport. The number of publications on
artistic swimming in comparison to other sports is still very low
(15,16), which does not allow for large compilations of
information, except for with regard to injuries and physiology,
which help to establish a homogeneous and valid scienti ﬁcb a s ei n
artistic swimming. However, the publication of articles on the
subject has been increasing considerably in recent years (especially
from 2005 to 2022), reaching a maximum level of publications in
2021 (with a total of 43 publications). For this reason, it is
considered a booming sport, and it is necessary to carry out
reviews that collect said information as in this bibliometric study.
It is relevant that the largest numbers of publications on artistic
swimming are case studies or documentary research. This may be
due to the dif ﬁculty of obtaining a high and homogeneous sample.

Even though the number of licenses and participation in international
championships has been increasing in the last decade ( 17), it is one of
the sports with the fewest licenses wo r l d w i d e .F o rt h i sr e a s o n ,i tc o u l dbe speculated that one of the reasons researchers opt for the
development of research with small samples is due to the limited
e x i s t e n c eo ff e d e r a t i v el i c e n s e si na r t i s t i cs w i m m i n gc o m p a r e dt o
other sports modalities, which leads to a possible lack of
participants for conducting a study.
Given the multidisciplinary nature of artistic swimming ( 5), the
ﬁelds in which scienti ﬁc production has been analysed are very
different. Even so, it seems that today the main concerns with
respect to achieving high performance in artistic swimming are
injury epidemiology and physiology. This may be directly
related to the great physiological demands that athletes are
subjected to in a different environment than usual and the

possible injury situations to which athletes are subjected due to
overuse during sports practice ( 5,18). Artistic swimming
requires a large number of hours of daily training that expose
the body to great stress and the joints to great wear ( 5), thus
documenting many injuries at the competitive level, with a high
prevalence of shoulder, knee and lower back injuries among
swimmers due to overuse as well as short-term injuries in
tendon muscles ( 19–22).
Also noteworthy are the studies that analyse the recovery effect
or body changes after several years, due to dedication, demands
and practical execution ( 18,23–25). In addition, topics such as
nutrition, biomechanics or psychology should not be left aside,
and their research should be promoted since their direct
relationship with performance in artistic swimming has beenamply demonstrated ( 26–28).
Regarding the sample, the data found and re ﬂected in the
results are in line with the low number of federated swimmers in
artistic swimming ( 29), which makes access to said sample
difﬁcult. Thus, the main investigations have stood out for the
study of cases or documentary research; for this reason, it can be
afﬁrmed that the creation of new facilities that adapt to the
needs of the sport is necessary and/or that more publicity about
the practice of this discipline should be generated; in this way,
there is the possibility of carrying out investigations with more
than 100 participants (at the moment only 7.27% correspond to
them) as occurs in much more popular sports.
Regarding the performance level of the sample, the percentage of
elite swimmers studied in the literature was higher than in other
swimming categories. This may be because there is a greater
interest within the scienti ﬁc community in high-performance
artistic swimming. Generally, since it is not a common topic
investigated in the scienti ﬁc community, the research groups that
are interested in artistic swimming are made up of members with
former practitioners or are usually related to or involved in the
sport itself, and for this reason, they have access to high-level
samples. Therefore, it would be necessary for researchers to take
into account not only highly competitive swimmers but also other
swimming categories for future studies. This allows the
establishment of sports strategies adapted to each age group.
Finally, a possible weakness of the study that must be
highlighted is the probability of the existence of a publication
bias due to the low signi ﬁcance of the art in certain scienti ﬁc
ﬁelds that causes them to be published in journals of low
scienti ﬁc quality, which are not included in the databases used.
Likewise, most of the studies continue to be heterogeneous,
which makes it dif ﬁcult to combine research by branch. The
main solution to these problems is the promotion and creationof more studies on the subject as well as its corresponding
promotion that would increase the relevance of the subject and
decrease the heterogeneity of the matter.Conclusions
Over the years there has been a considerable increase in studies
on artistic swimming, especially those with smaller samples (1 –50
swimmers) and professional athletes. Besides, the topics of greatest
interest in artistic swimming have been physiology, sports
performance and injuries. Even so, it seems that for the moment
artistic swimming has little impact, probably due to its status as
a minority sport and it having limited social and economic
impact. This study highlights the need to increase scienti ﬁc
research in artistic swimming that allows for reviews that
establish more homogeneous and relevant conclusions for this
sport ﬁeld. Likewise, a greater impulse is needed from the
environment of this sport (federations, organisations, clubs, and
athletes) to improve knowledge about their area; following this
path will achieve an increase in its performance by coaches and
athletes as well as an increase in its social repercussions.
