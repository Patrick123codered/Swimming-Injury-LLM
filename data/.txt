The Bri tish Columbia Injury Research and Prevention Unit (BCIRP U) was established by the Ministry of 
Health and the Minist er’s Injury Prevention Advisory Committe e in August 1997. BCIRP U is housed within 
the Evidence to Innovation research them e at BC Children’s Hospital (BCCH ) and supported by the 
Provincial Health Service s Authority (PHSA) and the University of British Columbia (UBC). BCIRP U’s vision 
is to be a leader in the production and transfer of injury prevention knowledge and the integration of 
evidence-based injury prevention practices into the daily lives of tho se at risk, tho se who care for them, 
and those with a mandate for public health and safety in British Columbia.

SPORT:  Swimming  Target Group:  Competitiv e (high schools and club -level to elite professionals) 
and recreational swimmers  
Injury Mechanisms:  All Injury: Musculoskeletal or concussion injury sustained while swimming (competitive or recreational). Shoulder injury, low er back pain 
(LBP) and knee injury reported separately. Not including submersion or drowning injury.  
Incidence/Prevalence  Risk/Protective Factors  Interventions  Implementation/Evaluation  Resources  
All Injury (competitive)  
Injury prevalence  in elite 
swimmers (all ages)  is reported as 
between 32.2% and 74.6%. The 
shoulder accounts for the highest 
proportion of injury (30.8 -62.4%), 
followed by the knee (12.9 -49.9%) 
and lower back (6.2 -17%). 1–7 
In elite competitive swimmers 
(age 15 -35y), injury incidence  for 
all injury is 2.64 per 1000 AE, for 
acute injury is 1.1 per 1000 AE and 
for overuse injury is 1.48 per 1000 
AE.2 
In collegiate (NCAA) swimmers,  
injury incidence ranges from 1.63 
to 6.06 injuries per 1000 athlete 
exposures (AE) for females and 
from 1.48 to 4.97 i njuries per 1000 
AE for males.4,5,8 
Injury rate during professional 
games  (competition and practice) 
is reported as 5.4% (2012 
Olympics) and ranges from 21.8 to 
60.1 per 1000 athletes in 
swimming and 94.6 to 117 injuries 
per 1000 athletes in open water Previous Injury  
History of any injury  increases 
elite collegiate swimmer's  rate of 
injury (per 1000 AEs) more than 
2.5 times (IRR= 2.74, 95% CI= 
1.18, 6.37) after adjusting for the 
other risk factors (gender, years 
swimming). History of injury to 
the same anatomical site  
increases injury risk almost 2 -fold 
in the adjusted model (IRR= 1.75, 
95% CI= 1.25, 2.45).4 
Being a freshman in elite 
collegiate swimmers  is a risk 
factor for injury. The risk of injury 
significantly decreased with 
subsequent years of eligibility  for 
women (x2, P = .03) and for 
combine d men's and women's 
teams (x2, P = .04).8  
Swimmers specializing in strokes 
other than freestyle  exhibited a 
33% greater risk (RR, 1.33 [1.001 -
1.77]) of injury than swimmers 
primarily specializing in freestyle.8 
 There have been no RCTs or 
other quality studies carried out 
to assess effectiveness of an 
injury prevention program on all 
musculoskeletal injury risk in 
competitive or  recreational 
swimmers. Descriptive reviews 
have pointed to potential 
interventions based on 
biomechanical studies of injury 
risk:  
Careful monitoring of training 
volume, intensity, and duration by 
coaches and physicians will 
minimize overuse injuries and 
identify athletes at risk of 
swimming injury.29 
 
Shoulder Injury  
One RCT30 has assessed a 
prevention program for shoulder 
pain (pain being a secondary 
outcome). Additional 
interventions are based on non -
RCT tested interventions from 
descriptive reviews:  There is insufficient evidence 
for interventions to warrant 
studies on implementation/ 
evaluation.  
One study, measuring the 
attitudes and behaviours 
concerning shoulder pain in 
high school competitive club 
swimmers, found that the 
majority of swimmers believe 
that mild and moderate 
shoulder pain is normal in 
swimming and should be 
tolerated to complete practice. 
This may be a potential barrier 
to implementing an injury 
prevention program. The study 
suggests tha t education 
programs that are focused on 
informing athletes of the long -
term consequences of 
practicing and competing with 
shoulder pain, the dangers of 
long -term pain medication 
usage, and the necessity of 
taking time off when injured 
may be effective in moderating 
their behaviours.33

Championships 2009 and 2013).9–11 
Prevalence  of injury in elite 
Paralympic swimmers  with sight 
restriction is 64% or 0.3 injuries 
per athlete per competition.12 
All Injury ( Recreational)  
A representative sample of US 
emergency department reported 
swimming injury  reported 88,891 
annually or 1 swimming injury 
every 6 minutes.13 In Australia, 
there are 2.2 swimming -related 
trauma or death incidents per 
100,00 participants per year.14 
Shoulder Injury  
In competitive swimmers , point 
prevalence  of shoulder injury 
ranges from 12.3 to 91%, annual 
prevalence  ranges from 23.9 -
25.9%.15–18 Point prevalence  in 
masters swimmers  is 19.4%.17 
Prevalence of shoulder 
impingement in competitive male 
swimmers  is 17% and increases 
with competition level - (state 12%, 
national 20% and international 
swimmers 35%).19 
Exposure -adjusted incidence rates 
for competitive club swimmers  is 
0.2 injuries per 1000 swim km for 
significant interfering shoulder pain 
and 0.3 injuries per 1000 swim km 
for a significant shoulder injury that 
lasted >2 weeks.20 Shoulder Injury  
From a systematic review, there 
is a moderate level of certainty 
that the following are risk factors 
for shoulder injury at all 
competition  levels: clinical joint 
laxity and instability, decreased 
internal and increased external 
shoulder rotation range of 
motion, previous history of 
pain/injury and higher 
competitive level.25 
Knee Injury  
Breaststroke swimmers have a 5 -
fold higher risk of knee pain 
(relative risk, 5.06, CI 2.07 -12.36; 
p=0.001). Swimming for more 
than four times a week has a 
higher risk for knee injuries (RR 
2.06, CI 1.21 -3.52).6 
Protective Factors  
Freestyle has a reduced relative 
risk (0.45, CI 0.27 -0.77; p=0.03) 
for knee pain. Stretching is 
associat ed with a five - fold 
reduced risk for overuse knee 
injuries (RR 0.179; p=0.041).6 
Lower Back Pain  
Butterfly swimmers have an 
increased risk of lower back pain 
(RR, 2.49, CI 1.21 -5.09.36; 
p=0.011).6 
Torso hyperextension during 
front crawl strokes is not a Descriptive reviews suggest that 
coaches should encourage 
increased body roll and scapula 
retraction during forward crawl, 
aiming at normal strength and 
endurance of the cuff and 
scapular stabilizers, as well as 
improving the flexibility of the 
anterior ca psule to prevent 
shoulder injury. This can be done 
through an endurance training 
and strengthening program for 
the shoulder and periscapular 
muscles with emphasis placed on 
the serratus anterior, rhomboids, 
lower trapezius and 
subscapularis.29,31 
An RCT investigating an 8-week 
stretching and strengthening 
programme  targeting periscapular 
muscles in elite collegiate (NCAA) 
swimmers  improved posture over 
the course of the season. 
However, there was no significant 
change in pain and function 
scores following the intervention 
(F(1,26)=0.853; p=0.389; 
1−β=0.145; ES 0.34). These 
participants were not followed 
throughout the season or longer 
to assess to effectiveness of the 
interventio n on prospective injury 
risk.30 
Otorrhea  
In children aged 0 -14 years 
following tympanostomy , an RCT  
Low er Back Pain  
In elite professional swimmers  
(age 16 -25y), there is no difference 
in prevalence  of self -reported LBP 
compared to no sport controls 
(52% vs. 64%; p=0.41).21 
In university swimmers , LBP 
prevalence  is 18.1% (point), 36.1% 
(4-weeks) 34.1% (1 -year), 32.6% 
(sports -life) and 47.8 -76.1% (life -
time). 22,23 Odds ratio of LBP during 
lifetime was 3.26 (CI 1.41 -8.01) 
compared to non -athletes and OR 
of deg enerative disc in swimmers 
was 2.87 (CI 1.31 -6.44) compared 
to nonathletes.23 
In adolescent competitive 
swimmers , swimmers had 
increased odds of LBP prevalence  
OR 1.61 (1.01 -2.57), particularly in 
females OR 2.1 (1.08 -4.06) 
compared to non -swimming 
controls.24 
 biomechanically viable major 
cause of LBP.26 
Glaucoma  
Frequently wearing swim goggles 
does not lead to an increased risk 
of glaucoma over time in adults.27 
Otorrhea  
Children who swim without ear 
protection following 
tympanostomy tube placement 
suffer the same number or fewer 
episodes of otorrhea than 
children who do not swim. 
Pooled RD -5.04 ( -11.6 to  1.5).28 
 found a statistically significant 
reduction in the rate of otorrhoea 
from 1.2 episodes to 0.84 
episodes in the year of follow -up 
(mean difference (MD) -0.36 
episodes per year in th ose that 
wore ear plugs  while swimming. 
The absolute reduction is unlikely 
to be clinically significant and 
equates to an average child 
having to wear ear plugs for 2.8 
years to prevent one episode of 
otorrhea.  
In a second RCT, there was no 
evidence of a reduction or 
increase in the rate of otorrhea 
(1.17 episodes per year in both 
groups; MD 0 episodes, 95% CI -
0.14 to 0.14) in those who 
avoided water  versus those who 
swam as usual.32 
 
There are clear gaps in the 
literature with regards to injury 
prevention interventions in 
swimming. There is a 
requirement for large, high -
quality RCTs to assess the 
effectiveness of injury prevention 
programs based on evidence -
based risk factors for 
musculoskeletal injury.

Review of Sport Injury Burden, Risk Fac tors and Prevention  
 
Swimming  
Incidence and Prevalence  
 
 Swimming is one of the most popular competitive Olympic sports with events in 
backstroke, butterfly, breaststroke, freestyle and individual medley. In addition, swimming is an 
extremely popular recreational sport, with participants across all age groups. D ue to the non -
load bearing nature of swimming, the most common injury type is overuse injuries (Kerr et al., 
2015) . 
 
Elite Swimmers  
 
 The prevalence of in elite swimmers across all ages is reported as between 32.2% and 
74.6%. The shoulder accounts for the highest proportion of injury (30.8 -62.4%), followed by th e 
knee (12.9 -49.9%) and lower back (6.2 -17%) (Chase et al., 2013; de Almeida et al., 2015; Kerr et 
al., 2015; Knobloch et al., 2008; Ristolainen et al., 2010; Sambanis  et al., 2013; Venancio & 
Tacani, 2012) . In elite competitive swimmers (ages 15 -35 years), the incidence of all injury is 
reported as 2.64 per 1000 athletic exposures (AE), acute injury at 1.1 per 1000 AE and overuse 
injury at 1.48 per 1000 AE (Ristolainen et al., 2010) . In collegiate (NCAA) swimmers, the injury 
incidence  range from 1.63 to 6.06 injuries per 1000 AE for females and from 1.48 to 4.97 injuries 
per 1000 AE for males (Chase et al., 2013; Kerr et al., 2015; Wolf et al., 2009) .  
 
 The injury rate during professional games (competition and practice from the 2012 
Olympic games) is reported to range from 21.8 to 60.1 per 1000 athletes in swimming and 94.6 
to 117 injuries per 1000 athletes in open water swimming (FINA World Championships 2009 and 
2013) (Engebretsen et al., 2013; Mountjoy et al., 2010, 2015) . The prevalence of injury in elite 
Paralympic swimmers with sight restriction is 64%, or 0.3 injuries per athlete per competition 
(Silva et al., 2013)  
 
 Shoulder injury is the most com mon site of injury in swimmers. In competitive swimmers, 
the point prevalence of shoulder injury ranges from 12.3 to 91%, and the annual prevalence 
ranges from 23.9 -25.9% (McKenna et al., 2012; Mohseni -Bandpei et al., 2012; Sein et al., 2010; 
Tate et al., 2012) . The point prev alence in masters level swimmers is reported at 19.4% (Tate et 
al., 2012) . The prevalence  of shoulder impingement in competitive male swimmers is reported at 
17% and increases with competition level (state 12%, national 20% and international swimmers 
35%) (Bansal et al., 2007) . Exposure -adjusted incidence  rates for competitive club swimmers is 
0.2 in juries per 1000 swim km for significant interfering shoulder pain and 0.3 injuries per 1000 
swim km for a significant shoulder injury that lasted >2 weeks (Walker et al., 2012) . 
 
 Lower back pain (LBP) is also commonly reported in all levels of swimming. In elite 
professional swimmers (ages 16 -25 years), there was no difference in the prevalence of self -
reported LBP comp ared to no sport controls (52% vs. 64%; p=0.41) (Folkvardsen et al., 2016) ; 
however, in university swimmers, LBP point prevalence is 18.1%, 36.1% at 4 -weeks,  34.1% at 1 -
year, 32.6% for sporting -life and 47.8 -76.1% for life -time prevalence (Hangai et  al., 2009; 
Noormohammadpour et al., 2016) . Compared to non -athletes, the odds of LBP during a 
swimmers lifetime was 3.26 higher (95% CI 1.41 to 8.01) compared to non -athletes and the odds 
of degenerative disc disease in swimmers was 2.87 (95% CI 1.31 t o 6.44) higher compared to 
non-athletes (Hangai et al., 2009) . In adolescent competitive swimmers, swimmers had an 
increased odds of LBP [Odds Ratio (OR)=1.61, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.57], particularly in females 
(OR=2.1, 95% CI 1.08 to 4.06), compared to non -swimming controls (Zaina et al., 2015) . 
 
 Finally, the i ncidence of knee injury in c ompetitive high school male swimmers/divers is 
reported as 1.5 per 1000 AE and in females as 2.5 per 1000 AE (Swenson et  al., 2013) . 
 
Recreational Swimming  
 
 The injury incidence rates for recreational swimmers are more difficult to calculate due a 
lack of reporting or variability in reporting standards. A representative sample of US emergency 
departments treating swimming injuries reported 88,891 injuries annu ally or 1 swimming injury 
every 6 minutes (Pollard et al., 2013) . In Australia, there are 2.2 swimming -related trauma or 
death incidents per 100,00 participants per year (Andrew et al., 2012) . 
 
Risk and Protective Factors  
 
 Many risk factors have been reported for all injury risk in swimmers. In elite collegiate 
swimmers, previous history of any injury increases the risk of injury (per 1000 AEs) more than 2.5 
times [Incidence rate ratio (IRR)= 2.74, 95% CI 1.18 to 6.37] after  adjusting for the other risk 
factors (such as gender and years swimming). Previous history of injury to the same anatomical 
site increases the risk of injury almost 2 -fold (IRR= 1.75, 95% CI 1.25 to 2.45) (Chase et al., 2013) .  
 
 Being a freshman in elite collegiate swimming is a risk  factor for injury. Freshman men 
and women had a mean of 1.20 injuries per swimmer compared to 0.57 injuries per senior 
swimmer (P = .04) (Wolf et al., 2009) . Swimmers specializi ng in strokes other than freestyle 
demonstrated a 33% greater risk of injury [Relative risk (RR)=1.33, 95% CI 1.00 -1.77] compared to 
swimmers primarily specializing in freestyle (Wo lf et al., 2009) . 
 
 Specific risk factors have been reported for shoulder injury in swimmers. A critical 
systematic review on all swimming competition levels reported that clinical joint laxity and 
instability, decreased internal and increased external shoulder rotation range of motion, previous 
history of pain/injury and higher competitive level are moderate risk factors for shoulder injury  
(Hill, Collins, & Posthumus, 2015) . 
 
 For knee injury, breaststroke swimmers are reported to have a 5 -fold higher risk of knee 
pain (RR=5.06,  95% CI 2.07 to 12.36) compared to other strokes (Knobloch et al., 2008) . 
Additionally, swimming more than four times a week was assoc iated with a higher risk for knee 
injuries (RR=2.06, 95% CI 1.21 to 3.52) relative to less than four times a week  (Knobloch et al., 
2008) . Freestyle swimming reduces the risk of knee pain (RR=0.45, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.77) relative 
to other strokes while stretching is reported to be associated with a five - fold reduced risk for 
overuse knee injuries (RR=0.179; p=0.041) compared to no stretching (Knobloch et al., 2008) . 
 
 For back injuries, butterfly swimmers have been found to have an increased risk of lower 
back pain (LBP) compared to other strokes (RR=2.49, CI 1.21 to 5.09) (Knobloch et al., 2008) . 
Torso hyperextension was previously thought to be a risk factor for LBP during front crawl 
strokes; (Du et al, 201 6) however, an experimental study of experienced collegiate swimmers 
reported that hyperextension was not a biomechanically viable cause of LBP, since no swimmer 
extended beyond their active torso range of motion during front crawl (Du et al., 2016) . 
 
 Previous literature has reported concerns regarding swimming and goggle use with eye 
injury. Recent literature has shown that frequent goggles use does not lead to an increased  risk 
of glaucoma in adults (Franchina et al., 2015) . Similar  concerns have been reported for otorrhoea 
(discharge from the ears) in young swimmers; however, children who swim without ear 
protection following tympanostomy  tube placement suffer the same number or fewer episodes 
of otorrhoea than children who do not swim [Pooled Risk difference (RD)= -5.04, 95% CI -11.6 to 
1.5] (Lee et al, 1999) . 
 
 Although impairments associated with injury and pain in swimmers have been studied, 
there is a lack of prospective research identifying the risk factors and protective factors for the 
developmen t of overuse injury. Moreover, it is not clear to what extent these associated factors 
are the cause or effect of the swimmers’ pain or if the impairment is a sport -specific adaptation 
needed for high -level swimming performance (Struyf et al., 2017) .  
 
Opportuni ties for Prevention: Effective I nterventions, Cost-Effectiveness, 
Implementation and Evaluation  
 
 There have been no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or other quality studies carried 
out to assess the eff ectiveness of an injury prevention program on musculoskeletal injury risk in 
competitive or recreational swimmers. The heterogeneity of ‘swimmers’ shoulder’ and the lack 
of knowledge regarding the etiology of swimming injury have reduced the ability to def ine and 
develop successful interventions. Descriptive reviews have pointed to potential interventions 
based on biomechanical studies of injury risk including careful monitoring of training volume, 
intensity, and duration by coaches and physicians. These in terventions are deemed to minimize 
overuse injuries and identify athletes at risk of swimming injury, (Wanivenhaus et al., 2012)  but 
have not been rigorously tested.  
 
 One RCT (Lynch et al., 2010)  assessed a prevention program for shoulder pain (pain as a 
secondary outcome) but did not follow -up with the swimmers at the end of the season. 
Additional interventions are based on non -RCT tested interventions from descriptive reviews. An 
RCT investigating an 8 -week stretching and strengthening programme targeting periscapular 
muscles in elite collegiate (NCAA) swimmers imp roved posture over the course of the season; 
however, there was no significant change in pain and function scores following the intervention 
(F(1,26)=0.853; p=0.389; 1−β=0.145; ES 0.34). These participants were not followed throughout 
the season or longer to assess to effectiveness of the intervention on prospective injury risk 
(Lynch et al., 2010) . 
 
 Descriptive reviews suggest that coaches should encourage increased body roll and 
scapula retraction during the forward crawl, aiming at normal streng th and endurance of the cuff 
and scapular stabilizers, as well as improving the flexibility of the anterior capsule to prevent 
shoulder injury. This can be done through an endurance training and strengthening program for 
the shoulder and periscapular muscl es with emphasis placed on the serratus anterior, 
rhomboids, lower trapezius and subscapularis (Bak, 2010 ; Wanivenhaus et al., 2012) . 
 
 In relation to otorrhoea, an RCT with children ages 0 -14 years following tympanostomy 
found a statistically significant reduction in the rate of otorrhoea from 1.2 episodes to 0.84 
episodes in the year of follow -up [mean d ifference (MD) -0.36 episodes per year] in those that 
wore ear plugs  while swimming. The absolute reduction is unlikely to be clinically significant and 
equates to an average child having to wear ear plugs for 2.8 years to prevent one episode of 
otorrhea (Moualed et al., 2016) . In a second RCT, there was no evidence of a reduction or 
increase in the rate of otorrhoea (1.17 episodes per year in both groups; MD 0 episodes, 95% CI -
0.14 to 0.14) in those who avoided water versus those who swam as usual (Moualed et al., 2016) . 
 
 There are clear gaps in the literature with regards to injury prevention interventions in 
swimming. There is a requirement for large, high -quality RCT s to assess the effectiveness of 
injury prevention programs based on evidence -based risk factors for musculoskeletal injury.  
 
Implementation/Evaluation  
 
 There is insufficient evidence for interventions on swimming injury to permit studies on 
factors that may facilitate implementation and/or evaluation. One study; however, measured the 
attitudes and behaviours concerning shoulder pain in high school competitive club swimmers. 
This study found that the majority of swimmers believe that mild and moderate shou lder pain is 
normal in swimming and should be tolerated to complete practice. This may be a potential 
barrier to implementing an injury prevention program. The study suggests that education 
programs that are focused on informing athletes of the long -term c onsequences of practicing 
and competing with shoulder pain, the dangers of long -term pain medication usage, and the 
necessity of taking time off when injured may be effective in moderating their behaviours 
(Hibberd & Myers, 2013) .
