Abstract 
Background The study aims to update the specific classification of mechanisms of death in swimming and to dem-
onstrate these categories are reasonable, by analyzing more characteristics of death cases, evaluating the available 
evidence and determining their quality.
Methods Original articles were queried from PubMed, Web of Science, Embase databases, Cochrane Library, 
and Scopus. Included studies, which were evaluated as level 4 evidence or higher according to the Oxford Centre 
for Evidence-Based Medicine, discussed hypothesized mechanisms of death in swimming. Parameters analyzed in this 
study included decedents’ characteristics, outcome measures, findings, methodological index for non-randomized 
studies (MINORS), and critical evaluation of each study classified by death mechanism.
Results A total of twenty-five studies were included for further analysis: fourteen were associated with cardiovascular 
diseases, two were about cerebrovascular diseases, two contained respiratory diseases, seven were about hazardous 
conditions and three contained other drownings, which provided evidence for mechanisms of death.
Conclusions It is found that cardiovascular disease is the main cause or contributing factor of death in swimming. 
Respiratory diseases and cerebrovascular diseases are difficult to be definitive mechanism categories due to insuf-
ficient evidence. Hazardous conditions appear to be one of the possible risk factors because there are more cases 
of deaths from unsafe environments in swimming, but further statistics and research are still needed to support this 
view. Our study may have important implications for developing potential prevention strategies for sports and exer -
cise medicine.

Background
Swimming and triathlons have become increasingly 
popular activities. Between 2009 and 2015, annual par -
ticipation in triathlons rose from 120,620 to 196,303 
(63%) in the United Kingdom [1 ]. A 2020 study investi -
gated children’s swimming ability, in which descriptive 
statistics showed that over 50% of children were able 
to perform some basic swimming skills [2 ]. According 
to existing studies, swimming is an exercise modality 
that is highly suitable for health promotion and disease 
prevention, such as cognitive functioning, the treat -
ment of major depressive disorder, cerebral palsy and *Correspondence:

other aspects [3 –6]. But swimming has also been found 
to cause injuries and even death. The majority of the 
deaths (95%) in triathlon competitions occur during the 
swim phase [7 ].
To prevent death in swimming, there have been 
some efforts to summarize the cause of death in swim -
ming. The possible causes of death in swimming have 
been summarized in a study, including exertional heat 
stroke, heart attack, long QT syndrome, pulmonary 
edema, knocked unconscious, and panic attack [8 ]. The 
study did not generalize and classify different mecha -
nisms from the causes of death, and the sample size for 
each cause of death was insignificant. And one study 
published in 2016 summarized possible mechanisms 
as hypothermia/hyperthermia, cardiac arrhythmias/
abnormalities and pulmonary edema, on the basis of 
which, they analyzed the outcome measures, findings, 
and critical evaluation for each case [9 ]. But this sys -
tematic review concluded that limited evidence does 
not support these as common death mechanisms. A 
new study classified the pre-existing medical conditions 
of fatal or non-fatal drowning as diseases of the nerv -
ous system, mental and behavioral conditions and dis -
eases of the circulatory system [10].
The study aims to update the possible classification of 
mechanisms of death in swimming, by evaluating the 
available evidence, whose quality is determined utilizing 
the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Develop -
ment and Evaluation, and analyzing the data of gender, 
age, location of the decedents to demonstrate that these 
categories are reasonable. These works provide a better 
understanding of swimming-related deaths, which may 
have implications in developing potential prevention 
strategies. We hypothesized that death mechanisms in 
swimming are cardiovascular diseases, Cerebrovascu -
lar diseases, respiratory diseases and hazardous condi -
tions, among which, cardiovascular diseases are the main 
mechanism.
Methods
Study selection
Articles were comprehensively retrieved via online 
database searching, a review of reference lists and cited 
reference searches. The online databases used were Pub -
Med, Web of Science, Embase databases, Scopus, and 
Cochrane Library. The retrieved articles were limited to 
human-subject literature published from 1990 to Jan 1st, 
2023. The following search terms were used: (“swim*” OR 
“swimming*” OR “triathlon*”) AND (“death*” OR “mor -
tality*”) AND (“drowning*” OR “pulmonary edema” OR 
“hyperthermia*” OR “hypothermia*” OR “sudden death” 
OR “cardiac arrhythmia*” OR “sudden cardiac death”).Inclusion and exclusion criteria
This study included articles that met the following 
inclusion criteria: (1) studies discussed hypothesized 
mechanism of death in swimming; and (2) level 4 evi -
dence or higher (case report, case series, case control 
studies, retrospective analysis or randomized clinical 
trial) according to the Oxford Centre for Evidence-
Based Medicine.
Irrelevant articles and studies that failed to meet 
inclusion criteria, including (1) articles studied deaths 
in diving and cold-water immersion (if not specifically 
related to swimming); and (2) studies investigating out -
comes of death in baths, were excluded.
Data extraction and analysis
Two authors (YY, LC) reviewed papers identified in 
searches, assessing potentially eligible studies for inclu -
sion and exclusion criteria. Type of article, grade of 
evidence reported outcomes, and available data were 
extracted independently. Any disagreements were 
resolved with discussion and additional review before 
final analysis by the professor (JH). No attempts were 
made to contact any of the authors to request addi -
tional data. Statistical analysis was feasible after sum -
marizing comparable outcomes between studies.
Parameters analyzed in this study included 1) out -
come measures, findings, and critical evaluation of 
each study classified by death mechanism; 2) gender, 
age, location of where the decedent died in swimming. 
And the methodological index for non-randomized 
studies (MINORS) checklist was used to assess the 
methodologic quality of the included non-randomized 
controlled studies (Supplemental Table 1 ).
Patient and public involvement
No patient involved. Neither patients nor the pub -
lic were involved in the design, conduct, reporting, or 
dissemination of the research, as it was not feasible or 
appropriate for this systematic review. Our review had 
registered on PROSPERO and was assigned with reg -
istration number: CRD42021267330, which is publicly 
available at https:// www. crd. york. ac. uk/ prosp  ero/ displ

Results
The flow of the literature search is presented in Fig.  1. 
The initial search identified 859 articles, including 
records identified through database searching and 
other sources. A total of 586 articles remained after 
duplicates were excluded. After the examination of 
titles and abstracts for relevance, 105 articles remained 
and full texts were assessed for eligibility. A total of 25

articles met all eligibility criteria investigating different 
death mechanisms during swimming (Table 1 ).
Cardiovascular diseases
Fourteen studies involving potential cardiac causes of 
swimming-related death met the criteria for inclusion 
(Table  2) (Supplemental Table  2). Among them, four 
studies of death in swimming have concluded that car -
diovascular disease is the main cause or contributing fac -
tor of death [1, 11–13]. The most common cardiovascular 
abnormalities is atherosclerotic coronary heart disease, in 
addition, arterial hypertension, chronic myopericarditis, 
cardiac aneurysm of the left ventricle and so on [14–16]. 
Most cases had varying degrees of coronary atherosclero -
sis, myocardial hypertrophy and myocardial scar, some -
times secondary to pulmonary edema (Table 3).
Some studies suggested that congenital or inherited 
cardiovascular abnormalities are contributing risk fac -
tors for hazardous events in swimming in many cases, 
especially for young people. In a study of 28 people who 
drowned while swimming, it was found that pathogenic 
mutations in critical ion channel genes may be present in 
nearly 30% of swim-related drowning cases, which were 
associated with potentially fatal arrhythmia syndromes 
known as long QT syndrome (LQTS) and catecholamin -
ergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) [17]. 
And a study of a 19-year-old female swimmer, who died 
of hypoxic encephalopathy after near-drowning, found 
that her myocardium samples showed a novel mutation 
in the ion channel gene KVLQT1, which causes long 
QT syndrome, and thus drowned in swimming [18]. In 
another study of a family, in which 3 members had ven -
tricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death caused 
by exercise, including a 12-year-old girl who died during 
a swimming competition, it was found that this disease 
appears to be inherited in an autosomal dominant man -
ner and can be triggered by swimming [19]. And other 
four studies, based on deaths in young people while 
swimming, concluded that congenital anomalies, such as 
anomalous origin of coronary artery (AOCA), should be 
considered in cases of major cardiac events in young peo -
ple [20–22], and hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopa -
thy (HOCM) was a risk factor for sudden cardiac death in 
young adults [23].
Cerebrovascular diseases
Two articles meeting the inclusion criteria respectively 
mentioned one death from cerebrovascular disease in 
middle-aged men, one of whom reported drowning due 
to cerebral, cerebellar, and subarachnoid hemorrhage, 
accompanied by cardiac enlargement, left ventricular 
hypertrophy and diffuse coronary atherosclerosis, while 
the other was confirmed diffuse cerebral infarction, cerebral hypoxia and arrhythmia while swimming 
(Table 4) (Supplemental Table 3) [1, 12].
Respiratory diseases
Two studies involving swimming related deaths due to 
respiratory diseases met the inclusion criteria (Table  5) 
(Supplemental Table  4). A study of 16 drowning cases, 4 
of which died of dangerous underwater breath-holding 
behaviors (DUBBs), including intentional hyperventila -
tion, static apnea, and hypoxic training [24]. Another 
study showed that a healthy 18-year-old male swimmer 
who suffered cardiopulmonary arrest while swimming in 
a freshwater lake is suspected to have died of secondary 
acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [25].
Hazardous conditions
Eleven articles met the inclusion criteria, which stud -
ied cases of death from dangerous circumstances while 
swimming (Table  6) (Supplemental Table  5). In a study, 
a boy died from electrocution while swimming and div -
ing [26]. A boy in another study died from drowning after 
being paralyzed by an electrical current from a defective 
pool light [27]. In two articles, there were respectively 
a 12-year-old girl [28] and a 13-year-old boy [29] who 
were trapped in a large, uncovered suction drainage hole 
and death had occurred due to drowning, which may be 
also related to traumatic shock caused by the suction 
mechanism. Decedents in two articles died from several 
distinct patterns of injury caused by crocodile attacks 
in swimming, including completely traumatic ruptures 
of the body, avulsions of limbs, punctures, ecchymosis, 
pulmonary congestion, edema, and so on [30, 31]. In a 
study of cold water swimming, two deaths in an official 
ice swimming competition was mentioned, whose cause 
of death from cold water swimming was an initial neuro -
genic cold shock response, or the initial neurogenic cold 
shock response or a progressive decrease in swimming 
efficiency or hypothermia [32]. In addition, drunken -
ness may lead to death in swimming, supported by two 
included cases [12, 14].
Others
Three studies involving drowning deaths in swimming 
due to other or unknown causes met the inclusion cri -
teria (Table  7) (Supplemental Table  6). The absence of 
formal swimming courses and delayed intervention 
are also contributing conditions to increase swimming 
mortality. A case–control study of 88 children and ado -
lescents aged 1 to 19 years who died of unintentional 
drowning found a protective association between past 
participation in formal swimming lessons and the risk of 
drowning in children [33]. A 50-year-old female swim -
mer died of postanoxic brain damage, multiorgan failure

syndrome, and other reasons following drowning due 
to delayed intervention by rescue teams after drowning 
[34]. Another study reported two drowning deaths from 
unknown causes during a 750-m swim [1].
Discussion
Our study identified cardiovascular disease as the most 
important mechanism of death in swimming [35]. Car -
diovascular disease was mentioned in nearly half (12 
/ 23) of the studies that met the inclusion criteria, and 
four studies concluded that cardiovascular disease was 
responsible for the majority of deaths in swimming. The 
most common cause of accidental death in young com -
petitive athletes is a cardiac illness, usually that of con -
genital etiology. Many seemingly healthy people who 
suffer fatal drowning while swimming may be due to 
severe cardiac arrhythmias, which are caused by con -
genital long-QT syndrome (LQTS) and catecholamin -
ergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT). In 
patients with LQTS, swimming has been identified as a 
relative gene-specific arrhythmia trigger for LQTS1 type 
(LQTS1) caused by KCNQ1 mutations, the exact mecha -
nism of which is unclear. The possible explanation is that 
the diving response during swimming triggers parasym -
pathetic driven bradycardia, while cold shock activates 
sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system, 
resulting in tachycardia, which constitutes "autonomic 
conflict". LQT1 patients with IKs channel dysfunction 
due to KCNQ1 mutations are less efficient than normal 
in shortening the QT interval during tachycardia. This 
lack of proper QT adaptation leads to possible apical 
torsion ventricular tachycardia [36]. Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia is an inherited 
arrhythmogenic disorder of myocardial calcium hemo -
stasis, autosomal dominant form and autosomal recessive 
form of which may be due to mutations in the ryanodine 
receptor and calmodulin 2 genes, respectively. Certain 
adrenergic triggers, such as swimming, predispose CPVT 
patients to sudden death via bidirectional polymorphic 
ventricular tachycardia [37]. Among the variable types 
of abnormal coronary artery origin, the AOCA passing 
between the pulmonary artery and the aorta, either the 
left coronary artery arising from the right coronary sinus 
(ALCA) or the right coronary artery arising from the 
left coronary artery (ARCA), carries a high risk of sud -
den death due to exercise load. The possible mechanism 
is that the coronary artery becomes squeezed by pass -
ing between an expanded PA and the aorta, so that the 
blood flow through the coronary artery becomes reduced 
during intense exercise, which leads to the occurrence of 
myocardial ischemia [21]. ARCA is four times more com -
mon than ALCA, but ALCA is a more common cause of 
sudden cardiac death than ARCA, because left ventricu -
lar ischemia from left main occlusion is usually more 
life-threatening than right coronary occlusion [22]. And 
based on a hemodynamic analysis of the anomalous ori -
gin of the right coronary artery (RCA) from the left coro -
nary artery sinus (AORL), the entrance cross-sectional 
area of AORL is reduced, leading to a decrease in the vol -
ume flow and pressure of RCA, which can be used as a 
numerical guide for clinical diagnosis of AORL ischemia 
symptoms [38]. Among aerobic exercises, swimming is 
associated with more catecholamine-induced tachycar -
dia and increased stroke volume and tachycardia, which Table 4 Studies on cases of death from cerebrovascular diseases in swimming

is also a risk factor for fatal functional outflow tract 
obstruction in patients with resting hypertrophic cardio -
myopathy, leading to fatal ventricular arrhythmias [23]. 
Overall, swimming deaths associated with cardiovascu -
lar disease vary with the age of the population, such as 
in young people the main risk factors are the AOCA, 
HOCM, and so on, while CHD is more considered in 
sports in the elderly [13, 21, 23]. The associated mortality 
highlights the importance of early athlete screening and 
identification of existing heart disease.
Respiratory diseases are thought to be not completely 
reliable to the hypothesized swimming death mecha -
nisms because few cases are supporting this mechanism. 
The included respiratory failure death cases are related 
to two concepts, DUBBs and ARDS [24, 25]. Hyperven -
tilation or breath-holding before diving or swimming 
reduces the body’s storage of  CO2 and carbon dioxide 
partial pressure  (PCO2) to delay the brain’s response to 
surface breathing which is an effective technique to trick 
their bodies into delaying the stimulation of breathing, 
thereby improving swimmers’ performance. However, 
the suppression of respiration also reduces the partial 
pressure of oxygen (PO2) in arterial blood, resulting 
in fatal hypoxia and loss of consciousness underwater, 
namely breath-hold blackout caused by DUBBs [24]. In 
different sports disciplines, swimming seems to have a 
higher incidence of Exercise-Associated Hyponatremia 
(EAH) than cycling, mountain biking, running and other 
events, especially in long-distance open water swimming. 
EAH progressively worsens during endurance exercise, 
and respiratory diseases, including respiratory arrest, 
occurs when plasma sodium concentrations are reduced 
to < 110–115 mmol/L, which can eventually lead to death 
[39]. In addition, swimming-induced pulmonary edema 
(SIPE) is characterized by rapid onset of shortness of 
breath, cough, and rales, which can be fatal if the ath -
lete continues to compete [40]. The increase in cardiac 
volume during swimming, on the one hand, increases 
the myocardial oxygen demand, on the other hand, also 
elevates the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure in heart that are noncompliant from previous myocardial 
infarction, which in turn increases the pulmonary venous 
pressure and may explain the cause of dyspnea [41]. In 
conclusion, more relevant studies should be conducted 
in the future to further investigate the injury mechanisms 
associated with respiratory diseases in swimming.
Deaths from hazardous environmental factors in swim -
ming, such as electrical casualties in swimming pools and 
malfunctioning drainage systems and so on, are impor -
tant public health issues, but the physiological mecha -
nisms involved are poorly studied. Compared to the 
typical "entrance-exit" wound pattern when exposed to 
electricity in dry conditions, swimming pool electrical 
damage appears to lack significant external tissue dam -
age, but rather cardiac symptoms are more commonly 
seen, that is, arrhythmias of varying degrees, ranging 
from essentially asymptomatic to severe and even fatal 
[42]. But according to the above case, another possible 
mechanism is that the muscles exposed to the low-volt -
age current become paralyzed, leaving the victim unable 
to escape the power source and drowning [27]. Trauma 
caused by inhalation by swimming pool drain, includ -
ing multiple organ congestion, abdominal contusion and 
so on, is not fatal in fact, so the direct factor of death is 
still drowning [28, 29]. Deaths from crocodile attacks 
can involve a combination of blunt or sharp force inju -
ries, blood loss, and drowning, as the trauma can be very 
severe, including almost complete fragmentation, head 
and chest crushing injuries, and limb avulsion, result -
ing in blunt craniocerebral trauma, cascading chest, and 
rapid death from exsanguination. Severe sepsis can also 
occur, as a variety of microorganisms have been found in 
the mouth of crocodiles, such as Salmonella, Aeromonas 
hydrophila, Clostridium, and others. But the exact role of 
each factor and the causal relationship between trauma 
and drowning may not be clear [30, 31]. The risk of 
death in the first stage of cold water swimming is mainly 
derived from the neurogenic cold shock response, while 
when immersed for a short period of time, the physical 
challenges are mainly related to musculoskeletal damage Table 7 Studies on cases of death from drowning due to other or unknown causes in swimming

caused by neuromuscular cooling, disrupted nerve con -
duction and increased nociceptive sensitivity (pain 
receptors), which can lead to a physiological state to 
peripheral paralysis and, as a result, may increase the risk 
of drowning. If athletes swim in cold water for too long, 
they may experience hemostasis due to hypothermia, lac -
tic acidosis, vascular insufficiency, cognitive impairment, 
and arrhythmia [32]. Cold water endurance swimming 
may affect the lungs of healthy leisure triathletes for up to 
2.5 h after swimming, and some people seem to be more 
prone to lung injury than others [43]. From the data avail -
able, the concentration-effect relationship between alco -
hol and drowning while boating, swimming, or engaging 
in any other water activity is apparent, and mechanisms 
may include dose-dependent psychomotor impairment, 
lowering of the cognitive processes, and increased risk-
taking behavior [44]. Mortality and cardiac arrest rates 
were 3.3 times higher among male participants over 40 
years of age than among men under 40 years of age, and 
the risk increased with each additional decade of age 
after 40 [11]. In conclusion, the hazardous condition is 
not an exact pathological mechanism, but rather a low 
probability risk factor, which may involve multiple pos -
sible mechanisms.
Drowning is a leading cause of unintentional injuries 
and deaths worldwide [45]. Univariate analysis showed 
that men and rural residents consistently had much 
higher drowning mortality rates than women and urban 
residents, which occurred mainly in natural water and 
during the summer season [46, 47]. Especially for chil -
dren under 4 years of age, drowning is the most common 
cause of accidental injury and death [45]. Participation 
in formal swimming lessons was associated with an 88% 
reduction in the risk of drowning in the 1- to 4-year-old 
children, while training of parents and supervisors in 
post-drowning prevention and first aid may also go some 
way to avoiding accidents [33, 48]. Especially in water-
rich countries such as the Netherlands, timely swimming 
safety education for the children and families of recent 
immigrants to help them adapt may be an important 
measure [49]. Survivors of drowning often experience 
severe neurological disorders, such as children with ABI 
from drowning suffer from a selective differentiation 
syndrome, in which motor deficits are largely respon -
sible for their inability to convey intact cognition and 
perception. But overall, the consequences of drowning 
in neuropathological studies have not been fully estab -
lished [34, 45, 50].
Drownings during swimming can also be the result 
of panic attacks, which are accompanied by a complete 
loss of swimming ability. Competitive swimmers can 
panic when swimming in open water because they face 
a different environment than an Olympic pool and need to use a different stroke than the one they trained for. 
Open-water swimmers can experience similar panics 
when suddenly confronted with icy water, rip currents, 
or unexpected underwater objects. The mechanism may 
be due to: an extreme sympathetic nervous system over-
activation causes a combination of physical and psycho -
logical stress during panic in water, which may aggravate 
cold shock, cause paralysis or loss of muscle strength, and 
cause complete or severe loss of swimming ability. It can 
eventually lead to accidental drowning or non-drowning 
death [51].
The epidemiology of exercise-related sudden car -
diac death has also been implicated in recent studies. In 
Spain, sports-related sudden cardiac death has a very low 
incidence, in which the most frequent sports disciplines 
are football (49%), gymnastics (15%), and running (12%) 
[52, 53]. And the main causes of sudden cardiac death are 
ischemic heart disease (63%), cardiomyopathies (21%), 
and sudden arrhythmic death syndrome (6%) [52]. A 
large sampling of Scottish and England population-based 
cohort, the association of six different types of sports/
exercises with the risk of all-cause and cardiovascu -
lar disease (CVD) mortality was investigated. In studies 
on the long-term health effects of specific sports, CVD 
mortality involved in swimming (HR = 0.59, 95% CI 0.46 
to 0.75), racquet sports (HR = 0.44, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.83) 
and aerobics (HR = 0.64, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.92) were sig -
nificantly reduced, with no significant effects on cycling, 
running, and football. These findings suggest that par -
ticipation in specific sports may have significant public 
health benefits [54]. And the three major causes of sud -
den death in organized school sports in Japan were sud -
den cardiac arrest, head trauma, and heat related injury, 
accounting for 77.2% of all reported cases [55]. Myocar -
dial inflammation is a common cause for the onset of 
cardiovascular disease and sudden cardiac death in ath -
letes. Physical exercise may be seen as an acute trigger of 
myocardial ischemia or arrhythmias in some susceptible 
individuals [56].
Taken together, in order to reduce the death caused by 
various factors in swimming, it is recommended to make a 
full range of preparations before swimming, during swim -
ming and after drowning and strive to update relevant 
facilities. Before swimming, all subjects wishing to per -
form moderate to high intensity exercise are advised to 
undergo pre-participation screening and annual follow-up, 
including thorough preparticipation physical examination 
and indicated diagnostic tests, which may help in avoid -
ing the fatal event [16, 57]. For example, echocardiography 
is an effective method to detect congenital cardiovascu -
lar abnormalities [16, 21]. In order to ensure the safety 
of the swimming environment, the swimming pool staff  
should eliminate the hidden dangers of the swimming pool 
Page 11 of 13
 Yao et al. BMC Sports Science, Medicine and Rehabilitation            (2024) 16:6 
 
lighting and drainage system, and swimmers in the field 
should ensure that there are no sharks, rapids and other 
dangerous factors in the environment before entering the 
water [26– 31]. During exercise, swimmers are advised 
to wear a portable monitor to monitor their heart rate to 
prevent sudden illness such as sudden cardiac death. The 
development of portable monitors that can detect electro -
cardiograms will also be beneficial. It will be better if the 
monitor or sensor can be connected with automatic life-
saving system and shore helper wirelessly, or call for help 
to prompting rescue automaticly. In addition, improve -
ments are necessary for emergency rescue systems for 
drowning people in triathlon or other swimming environ -
ments, such as providing flotation devices to swimmers via 
drones or using new self-inflatable Quick Rescue (QR) flo -
tation device [58, 59]. Municipalities and jurisdictions are 
advised to consider preventing DUBBs by enacting public 
health education and regulations to reduce the associated 
fatal and non-fatal injuries in swimming [24]. In general, 
in addition to the invention, maintenance and update of 
protective facilities, the realization of swimming safety 
depends more on the safety awareness and protection level 
of swimmers themselves, so the publicity and education of 
swimming safety for professional swimmers and the pub -
lic is crucial. And water safety competency assessments 
should be universal, not only in swimming pools but also 
in open water, to ensure that swimmers know whether 
they have the ability to spot potential hazards and stay safe 
in different water environments [60].
Several limitations of this study should be men -
tioned. First, due to the limitations of research method 
design, the lack of international collaboration may lead 
to potential publication bias. In addition, since the database we selected is Pubmed and other international 
databases with a wide range of use, in fact, we did not 
search the literature in some domestic databases of non-
native English speaking countries such as China (China 
National Knowledge Infrastructure), Russia (eLibrary), 
and France (Cairn), which may lead to our omission 
of non-English studies in literature inclusion. Second, 
due to the imperfect detection system and the absence 
of autopsy reports, some cases of deaths in swimming 
have not been reported or analyzed in depth, which 
results in too small sample sizes for some mechanisms. 
In some cases, the information of the age, sex, and place 
of death was incomplete, which leads to some omissions 
in the statistics. Third, the risk factors mentioned above 
are not necessarily the actual fatal cause, as it is diffi -
cult to determine from an autopsy whether it occurred 
during or after swimming. Future research needs to be 
done through closer international collaboration, such as 
recruiting players from World Aquatics or other interna -
tional organizations for swimming as research subjects 
or collecting data from them [61]. Additional cases with 
full autopsy reports will be studied to determine whether 
respiratory diseases and hazardous environments are 
reliable mechanisms and to explore the potential neuro -
humoral, cardiovascular, metabolic or respiratory mech -
anisms involved. Besides, researches related to updating 
prevention strategies, such as drowning detection and 
emergency rescue systems, are also necessary.
Conclusion
The included studies support possible death mecha -
nisms (Fig.  2). Cardiovascular diseases are the main 
cause or contributing factor of death in swimming, 
Fig. 2 Mechanisms of swimming-related death

while hazardous conditions appear to be medium-risk 
mechanisms, as well as cerebrovascular diseases and 
respiratory diseases are relatively low-risk. However, 
there are still some limitations, including the small 
sample size of cases, which leads to the failure of in-
depth analysis of some mechanisms, and the absence of 
detailed autopsy reports, especially ones that contain 
detailed information about future age, sex and place of 
death. Our study summarizes several possible mecha -
nisms of death in swimming, which may have implica -
tions in developing potential prevention strategies in 
sport and exercise medicine.
