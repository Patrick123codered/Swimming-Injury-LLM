ABSTRACT
Fundaments and objective:  Sports play an important role in
the physical rehabilitation of patients with spinal cord injury by broad-
ening the therapeutic alternatives in addition to providing function-
al independence. The objective of this study is to determining theeffects of swimming on the functional capacity of patients with
spinal cord injury. Methods:  16 patients with spinal cord injury were
divided into two groups: experimental and control. The assessmentof both groups was performed using the Functional Independence
Measure (FIM scale) before and after the trial, which consisted of
swimming sessions performed twice a week during a period offour months. Results:  Both groups demonstrated noticeable gains
related to body care, transference, overall and motor scores, even
though the experimental group presented greater gains in trans-ference, overall motor score and overall score. Conclusion:  The
swimming activity was effective in improving their physical condi-
tion, bringing motor benefits on the functional capacity of partici-pants from the experimental group.
INTRODUCTION
The medicine advancements occurred in the last decades and
the consequent increase on the survival rate of patients with spi-nal cord injury
(1) (SCI) were followed by and evolution on the re-
spective treatment that today is part of the medical care for being
vital in the facing of “disadvantages” by handicaps. Sports play animportant role in the rehabilitation process: it complements and
enlarges alternatives; stimulates and develops physical, psycho-
logical and social aspects and furthers independence
(2-6).
Therapeutic effects of the sportive activity
The benefits of the physical training on athletes with SCI report-
ed in literature are: enhanced oxygen uptake ( VO2max.)(7-10), aero-
bic capacity gain(10), reduction on the risk of cardiovascular diseas-
es(8,9) and respiratory infections(10), decrease on the incidence of
medical complications(8,11) (urinary infections, scabs and renal in-
fections), reduction on hospitalizations(8,10,11) , increase on the life
expectancy(12), increase on the social integration levels(5), support
on the facing of the disability(13), improvement on the self-image,
self-esteem and life satisfaction(14,15) and decrease on the probabil-
ity of psychological disturbances(9).
Heath and Fentem(16) emphasize evidences pointed by several
studies in which the regular practice of physical activities is associ-
ated to the increase on the functional status and quality of life ofindividuals with disabilities. The authors also emphasize that theregular practice of physical activities avoids diseases, promotes
health and preserves the functional independence.
The sportive practice in the hospitalization condition, in turn,
complements the medical and physiotherapeutic care, reduces the
hospitalization time, increases the independence degree and theinitiative capacity, contributes for the education and the adoption
of behavioral procedures in order to assure the continuity of the
process aimed at the physical and mental health and social wel-fare
(17).
The objectives of the sports for paraplegics and tetraplegics are:
to promote education for health, to educate the individual for life insociety and leisure, to provide successful experiences, to increase
the tolerance to frustration, to promote social contact, to make
individuals more independent
(15-18), to improve self-image and self-
esteem, to develop the residual potential, to improve the organo-
functional condition and to improve the physical qualities (resis-
tance, strength and velocity)(18).
Studies conducted by Bauman and Spungen(19) revealed that the
lack of movement and a prolonged inactivity in individuals with SCI
promote the reduction on the glucose intolerance level with asso-ciation with hyperinsulinemia, being minimized with short periods
of physical activity. The moderate intensity physical activity reduc-
es the basal insulin secretion in response to a carbohydrate load.The study revealed that the inactiveness increases the risk of de-
veloping diabetes mellitus and early aging in this population.
Individuals with SCI, who practice regular physical activities,
perceive benefits not only in their physical and emotional health,
but also gains in their general functionality
(8).
Swimming for individuals with spinal cord injury
Souza(17) emphasizes, among the swimming therapeutic resourc-
es, the prevention of secondary disturbances and inactiveness, thepartial improvement on the affected or non-affected functions and
the functional improvement of the trunk, arms and scapular waist
musculature. Swimming, besides the water adaptation and thepossibility of performing muscular work with no gravity action, pro-
vides the possibility of a continuous exercise of the respiratory,
circulatory and muscular functions and decreases the spasticity
(20).
Bates and Hanson(21) attribute such property to the fact that one
reaches relaxation more easily in the water environment, besides
producing a sensitive stimulation of  temperature, touch and pres-
sure. Moreover, swimming has shown benefits in the development
of movements that promote a new postural control(22-24).
The swimming activity for individuals with disabilities has been
defined as the capacity of dominating the water element, dislocat-
ing in a safe and independent way under and on the water by using
their functional capacity and respecting their limitations(25,26). Skin-
ner and Thomson(27) suggest the following advantages of the wa-
ter activity: the body weight relief, promoting gait training in indi-
viduals with locomotion difficulties; the muscular strengthening infunction of the higher density of the environment, the muscular
238e Rev Bras Med Esporte _ Vol. 11, Nº 4 – Jul/Ago, 2005relaxation and the activation of the blood circulation as result of
the turbulence effect.
Swimming provides the following advantages for paraplegics and
tetraplegics: to experience new playful-motor options in water with
no auxiliary means; to achieve the necessity of moving; relaxation;
the reduction on the physical and psychic dependence; the socialreinsertion; the transition between being “diseased” and “healthy”,
“able” and “unable” and “patient” and “pupil”; the temporary
permanence out of the wheelchair and the prevention of scabs;the incentive to the will power, self-image, self-confidence and self-
esteem
(17).
Although there are so many studies on the benefits of the sports
practice in literature, not much is known about the impact of such
practice, particularly swimming, on the functional independence
of patients with SCI. The functional independence measuredthrough the FIM scale
(28) evaluates the impact of the SCI on the
daily activities and has called the attention of rehabilitation staffs(29-
35). Studies suggest that this scale provides subsides for a good
correlation between the amount of data obtained and the diversity
of professionals involved in the measurement of these data(13); that
the scale is reliable and sensible to changes related to the self-care and locomotion abilities and provides subsides for medical-
therapeutic and research procedures
(34,35).
The objective of this study was to verify the effects of a swim-
ming program on the functional abilities of patients with SCI. The
relevance of this study lies in the necessity of better understand-ing the role and contribution of the physical education for the reha-
bilitation staff to indicate this sportive modality to patients with
SCI.
METHODOLOGY
Participants
Sixteen individuals with spinal cord lesion attended in the Sarah-
Brasilia Hospital rehabilitation program, who live in the city of Bra-silia were selected and divided into two groups. The participants
were recruited according to the following inclusion criteria: 1) to
be carrier of traumatic spinal cord lesion classified as ASIA “A”*,2) to have participated in the rehabilitation program for a period
equal to or greater than four weeks; 3) the time of injury must be
shorter than four years and 4) to be clinically stable and to presentno contra-indication to swimming.
The distribution of patients into experimental (EG) and control
(CG) groups was performed in function of the condition to dislo-cate to the experiment site and the liability in participating con-
stantly in the activities proposed. The EG was composed of eight
participants (seven men and one woman) with ages ranging from21 to 34 years, with time of injury ranging from one year and three
months to three years and four months. The CG was composed of
eight participants (seven men and one woman) with ages rangingfrom 21 to 41 years, with time of injury ranging from one year and
two months to two years and two months (table 1).
* The injury classification is measured through the ASIA scale (American
Spinal Injury Association(36)) that classifies the lesion involvement as
follows: ASIA “A” = complete; ASIA “B” = incomplete: preserved sen-
sibility but there is no motor function below injury level. ASIA “C” =
incomplete: motor function preserved below injury level and most key-muscles below neurological level present voluntary movement in the
absence of the gravity force in the entire movement range. ASIA “D” =
incomplete: motor function preserved below injury level and most key-muscles below neurological level present voluntary movement in the
absence of the gravity force in the entire movement range.TABLE 1

The participants signed a free and cleared consent term, accord-
ing to resolution of the Brasilia Catholic University Ethics Commit-tee, according to Norms of Researches Involving Human Beings
(37).
The research was previously approved by the SARAH Net Ethics
Committee.
Instrument
The FIM scale(28) (Functional Independence Measure) was used
in order to evaluate the capacity of patients in relation to self-care,
control of sphincters, mobility, communication and social integra-
tion in a 1-7 scale. This scale evaluates 18 items and the patient’sscore ranges from 18 to 126 points.
The scores are: 1 – total assistance; 2 – maximum assistance; 3
– moderate assistance; 4 – assistance with minimum contact; 5 –supervision or preparation; 6 – modified independence and 7 – full
independence.
Full Dependence is considered when the patient performs less
than 50% of the work and requires maximum assistance in order
to perform activities and scores one and two. Modified Depen-dence is considered when the patient performs 50% or more of
the work and in this case the score is three, four and five, depend-ing on the assistance level. The patient who needs the help of an
assistant in the supervision or in the physical assistance is consid-
ered as Dependent. The patient is considered as Independent whenhe does not need the help of anybody to develop a given activity.
In this case, the score may be six or seven (depending on the use
or not of some device or on the performance within reasonabletime interval).
Rev Bras Med Esporte _ Vol. 11, Nº 4 – Jul/Ago, 2005 239eThe FIM scale is divided into two scores, which are subdivided
into the following items: 1) Motor score: to eat, to get ready, to
take shower, to dress the upper body, to dress the lower body, touse the bathroom, to control the bladder, to control intestines, to
transfer from bed to the wheelchair, to transfer from wheelchair to
the bathroom, transferences in bathroom and shower, wheelchair/stairs. 2) Cognitive score: comprehension, expression, social inte-
gration, resolution of problems, memory.
Data are collected at the first 72 hours after admission and dis-
charge from hospital. The follow-up data should be collected be-tween 80 and 180 days after discharge from hospital.
Procedures
All participants were submitted to FIM scale measurement in
two occasions: at the discharge from hospital (pretest) and four
months after the intervention period (posttest).
Among the activities performed in the rehabilitation program,
the patients participated in orientation classes on several topicsrelated to the spinal cord injury: explanations on spinal cord injury,
vesicular-intestinal reeducation, sexual orientation and cares with
skin. Besides classes and psycho-pedagogical follow-up, the pa-tients performed physiotherapeutic activities such as locomotion
training in wheelchair or gait training among others and sportive
physical activities.
In relation to the CG, the only recommendation was in case pa-
tients engaged in any oriented physical activity, they should com-
municate to the study’s organizers. At the moment of discharge
from hospital, a return in four months for the performance of theposttest measurement was fixed to participants from both groups.
The EG started the swimming activity in the hydrotherapy sec-
tor of the hospital with the supervision of a Physical Education
professor oriented to conduct the swimming class in its widest
meaning: from adaptation to the water environment to the improve-ment of the swimming strokes.
The swimming concept is wide and allows different interpreta-
tions if aspects relative to the swimming strokes techniques and
the way human beings move in the water environment are consid-ered. In the perspective of the present research, we have adopted
the concept of Burkhardt and Escobar
(25), who consider swimming
as the ability one presents of maintaining and moving himself onthe water without touching the bottom, in other words, in an inde-
pendent way. Thus, the fulfilling of the technical aspects of the
four types of swimming strokes is not expected, but rather theevidence of his complete adaptation to the water environment.
The EG participated in swimming classes during this time inter-
val (average of 30 sessions). The swimming classes took place
twice a week with duration of 45 minutes each. The class time
was distributed into: warm-up exercises, main part and back tocalm situation. In the warm-up phase, the following exercises were
performed out of the water: muscular stretching, training of trans-
ference from wheelchair to the ground and from the ground to theswimming pool, where different techniques to enter the swim-
ming pool were tested. In the swimming pool, the exercises were
aimed at the organic adaptation to the water. In the main part,exercises aimed at the independence in the water environment
were developed, considering the change on the balance point and
the movement referential. Crawl, backstroke and breaststroke ed-ucative exercises were performed. In the last part, the objective
was the return to calm situation emphasizing relaxation, fluctua-
tion and respiration. In this moment, techniques to get out of theswimming pool and the transference from the ground to the wheel-
chair were trained.
In order to minimize gauging errors, the posttest (120 days from
pretest) measurements were performed by a single appraiser – aNurse – who did not know which group the participant belonged
to.Data treatment and analysis
The paired “t” Test was used for the analysis of scores obtained
in the application of the FIM scale at the admission and discharge
from hospital and in the pre and posttest of experimental and con-trol groups. For the comparison of averages of the FIM scale scores
before and after the experiment between EG and CG, the “t” Test
for independent samples was used.
The paired “t” test was selected for treating repeated measures
and for being a small-size sample evaluation. Thence, the “t” test
was also confirmed through the Wilcoxon test.
RESULTS
The characteristics of participants from both groups revealed no
significant differences in relation to age (p = 0.26), gender (Fisher
exact test, p = 0.76) and etiology. The averages of the FIM scalescores of the EG and CG measured in the pretest and posttest
showed that, in general, the scores of the EG in the admission
were better than scores of the CG, but tests presented no differ-ences. In the discharge from hospital, the scores were compara-
ble with no significant differences.
Table 2 presents the scores of the groups, showing the anterior
and posterior situations of both groups in the experiment. The tests
showed that both the EG and the CG presented changes after the
experiment. The EG presented gains on seven distinct abilities andthe CG on three. The EG presented significant changes in relation
to abilities of body care (including bath and to dress the lower body);
transferences (including bed-chair-wheelchair, bathroom, bathtub-shower); overall motor score and overall score. The CG presented
significant changes in general scores related to the following abil-
ities: body care (including bathroom); transferences; overall motorscore and overall score.

240e Rev Bras Med Esporte _ Vol. 11, Nº 4 – Jul/Ago, 2005Table 3 presents the average of gains reached between the be-
ginning and end of the experiment between groups and one ob-
serves that the EG presented more significant gains in relation tothe CG in the following abilities: transference (bathroom, bathtub
and shower); overall motor score and overall score. Differences
between groups were verified in two specific transference abili-ties (bathroom and bathtub-shower) and in the total motor result.
Such observation revealed that the groups presented heteroge-
neous results and that, although both have presented significantgains, the experimental group presented higher gains (p = 0.01).In turn, the motor score gains were observed in the improve-
ment on the self-care abilities such as the dress activities: the pa-
tient improved his dressing performance both for the lower bodyand the upper body. Generally, the improvements presented after
the swimming activity brought direct benefits on the residual mo-
tor functionality maximization, leading to an optimization of timeand energy spent in the performance of their daily activities.
Although there are no studies on the effects of the swimming
activity on the independence measure of patients with spinal cordinjury in literature, studies on the psychological and physical ef-
fects of oriented sportive practices invariably show that these ef-
fects are beneficial
(7-14). In this context, the present study corrobo-
rates with what literature points in relation to the positive effects
of the swimming activity on the functional independence.
Once the methodology of the present study foresees non-ran-
dom distribution of participants, this fact has brought possible er-
rors on the selection of participants from experimental and control
groups. Probably, the motivation presented by the EG may haveperformed a positive effect on the performance of these partici-
pants in the evaluated abilities. In fact, the performance of the EG
was significantly higher when compared to the CG. However, suchvariable was not exclusive of EG, once the participation of the EG
was not only decided based on the motivation of the participant.
Although all participants have shown interest in performing theactivity proposed, some of them presented difficulties in partici-
pating in the experimental group due to work or study activities
during the experimental period or due to transportation difficulties.In some of these examples, it was observed that the adhesion of
the family had direct implications on the possibility of performing
the given activity. However, the study would have been less influ-enced by variables from this nature if the sample composition had
been random.
Other important results verified in the EG were the improve-
ments observed in relation to the physical, psychological and so-
cial aspects after the participation on the experiment and that prob-
ably were result of the regular practice of the swimming activity.These aspects, in turn, are closely related to the functional inde-
pendence measure of patients with spinal cord injury. Although
the analysis of the beneficial effects of this practice on the im-provement on the quality of life of the participants was not the
objective of this study, such topic deserves to be studied in further
researches.
In relation to the relevance of the instrument used, the FIM scale
showed to be of easy application
(30-35), however, limitations to its
sensibility and reliability were observed in evaluating the quality ofthe movement performed as well as its omission in relation to the
motivational aspects. New studies should be conducted with the
objective of elaborating independence measure instruments thatcould be used in the rehabilitation context of patients with spinal
cord injury and sensible to changes on the movement quality as-
pects related to improvements on the physical, psychological andsocial condition such as those resulting from the regular practice
of physical activities.
There is no doubt that the practice of sports and recreation bring
many benefits to individuals with SCI that reflect in the improve-
ment on the performance of daily activities, in the promotion of
physical and social welfare and in the reduction on the incidenceof clinical complications. The rehabilitation interdisciplinary staff
should encourage the participation of patients in sportive and rec-
reational activities, emphasizing aspects such as security, enter-tainment, cooperation and friendship. Moreover, some patients lose
interest with the rehabilitation routine and the inclusion of sports
in their treatment could be suggested and well accepted for pro-viding relief for the daily rehabilitation severity
(5). It is also impor-
tant that the rehabilitation staff be aware that there is no ideal pa-
tient for such participation especially because, along with themedicine advancements, other important evolutions have occurred,TABLE 3

DISCUSSION
The type of study performed – almost experimental – enables
the comparison of results obtained between EG and CG with treat-
ments, measure of results, experimental units and uses no ran-dom allocation to create comparisons in which the effects of treat-
ments are evaluated.
The results of the experiment indicate statistically significant
changes between EG and CG considering the functional abilities
measured through the FIM scale in relation to transferences, gen-
eral motor aspects and overall score. One concludes, therefore,that the swimming physical activity was effective to improve the
physical condition, bringing motor benefits detected through the
FIM scale and with direct and objective application on the func-tional abilities of participants from the EG. The implications of the
gains on the FIM scale scores directly reflect on the independence
measure of patients in their daily activities. The gains on the trans-ference activities were clearly evidenced in improvements on the
abilities of moving without help from one place to another: to move
from the wheelchair to the bed or to the bathroom, from the bath-room to the shower, among others.
Rev Bras Med Esporte _ Vol. 11, Nº 4 – Jul/Ago, 2005 241ewhat resulted in the production of several adaptations that make
the practice of many sportive modalities accessible to all.
Therefore, one could conclude that all rehabilitation programs
should include the practice of sports in their programs with the
objective of obtaining the benefits that these programs provide for
the health of patients. The new rehabilitation paradigm(1,2) has long
recommended the therapeutic sports; although one observes in
practice that the valorization of the Physical Education Hospital
Professor professional category has slowly increased in relation tothe roll of professional who compose a real rehabilitation interdis-
ciplinary staff.
All the authors declared there is not any potential conflict of inter-
ests regarding this article.
