Abstract 
Artistic (synchronized) swimming is a fast-paced, predominantly female aesthetic sport on which 
there has been very little research.  Despite origins in theatrical performance, the physical 
demands of artistic swimming have evolved significantly, subsequently increasing the potential 
for traumatic injury, including concussion.  Sport-related concussion is a traumatic brain injury 
that can result in behavioural complaints, cognitive impairments, mood disturbance, and altered 
sleep.  Despite findings that female athletes may experience a greater rate of concussion, more 
symptoms, and longer recovery than male athletes, females remain under-represented in sport 
concussion research.  Sport-related concussion in artistic swimming has not yet been examined. 
The purpose of this research was to explore the incidence and injury context of sport-related 
concussion in youth artistic swimmers in Ontario within a community-based research setting.  
First, a retrospective study examined the injury context factors surrounding concussions 
sustained during artistic swimming.  Second, a prospective study measured the incidence of 
concussion in this population over one season, and further explored the injury context of 
concussion.  The incidence risk of concussion was 1.91%, and the clinical incidence was 1.91 
per 100 athletes. The most frequent mechanism of injury was contact with another athlete, most 
commonly during pattern transitions and highlights.  Concussions occurred most frequently in 
in-pool training between November and March, and in the deep-end of the pool. 
Valuable sport-specific concussion resources for the artistic swimming community were 
developed through collaboration with Ontario Artistic Swimming.  One of these resources was 
 
iii  
an injury tracking program.  A qualitative study examining coaches’ perceptions of the injury 
tracker provided valuable feedback for improvements.  The important lessons learned from this 
partnership include the identification of contact between athletes in artistic swimming, findings 
of concussion incidence comparable to other girls’ sports, and description of the injury contexts 
associated with concussion in artistic swimming.  Exploration of concussion in artistic 
swimming is warranted to protect the health and safety of these athletes, to expand the research 
on sport concussion in girls and women, and assist coaches and officials in understanding the 
nature of concussions in artistic swimming.

Introduction 
 Introduction  
1.1 Background  
Sport-related concussion (SRC) has emerged as a significant issue in the field of sports medicine.  
Some estimates suggest there are 1.6-3.8 million SRCs in the United States per year (Langlois, 
Rutland-Brown & Wald, 2006); however, many agree that this range is underestimated because 
of under-reporting and measurement challenges (Noble & Hesdorffer, 2013).  In Ontario, 
pediatric visits to physician offices and emergency departments because of concussion increased 
4.4 times per 100 000 children between 2003 and 2013 (Zemek et al., 2017).  Despite the limited 
epidemiological data available, it appears that SRC is pervasive at all levels of sport 
participation, from recreational to professional.   
According to the Concussion in Sport Group, a concussion is a type of mild traumatic brain 
injury (mTBI) caused by direct or indirect forces to the head, face, neck or body (McCrory et al., 
2017).  The result is a complex pathophysiological cascade that manifests as a disruption of 
regular neurological processes.  Concussion is defined as a functional rather than a structural 
injury, so-called due to the observed disruption in brain function without any accompanying 
gross structural abnormalities on traditional radiographical images (DiFiori & Giza, 2010).  
Currently, concussion is diagnosed based solely on signs and symptoms, which are organized 
into six categories: (1) symptoms, which can be further broken down into somatic, cognitive, and 
emotional sub-categories, (2) physical signs such as amnesia or loss of consciousness, (3) 
balance disturbances, (4) behavioural changes, (5) cognitive impairments such as slowed 
reaction times, and (6) sleep disturbances, such as sleeping more or less than usual (McCrory et 
al., 2017).   
The majority (80-90%) of concussed athletes will fully recover from their injury in 7-10 days 
(McCrory et al., 2005).  However, some athletes experience persistent symptoms that can last for 
several weeks, months or—in rare cases—years after the injury (Ryan & Warden, 2003).  The 
Berlin consensus defines persistent symptoms as those lasting beyond 10-14 days in adults and 
longer than four weeks in children (McCrory et al., 2017).  
2 
 Even for those athletes that do recover within 10 days, the experience of sustaining and 
recovering from a concussion can be very stressful.  Many athletes find it difficult to cope with 
the rehabilitation process (Bloom, Horton, McCrory & Johnston, 2004).  For years, the best 
practice for concussion management was complete physical and cognitive rest until 
asymptomatic, followed by a graded return to activity progression (McCrory et al., 2017).  
However, results of systematic reviews indicate that there is limited support for any treatment of 
concussion, including these graduated activity protocols (Schneider et al., 2013).  It is now 
believed that complete rest during the acute period (24-48 hours) post-injury, followed by a 
gradual and progressive return to activity at sub-symptom threshold levels, should be encouraged 
(McCrory et al., 2017).  Due to the nebulous nature of the symptoms, the “invisibility” of the 
injury, and the restrictive recovery process associated with concussion, the injury experience for 
athletes is very different from that of musculoskeletal injuries.  Athletes report feeling isolated 
and frustrated during the concussion recovery process (Bloom et al., 2004).  There is evidence 
indicating that concussed athletes are exhibiting a stress response through disruption of the 
autonomic nervous system (Senthinathan, 2013).  This autonomic dysfunction may be 
exacerbated by the stressful nature of the concussion recovery protocol.  This indicates that SRC 
is unique from other types of athletic injuries, and scientific investigation specific to concussion 
injury is needed as findings from other injury studies may not be applicable to concussion.  
Sport-specific concussion studies have been conducted in some sports, such as football (e.g. 
Guskiewicz, Weaver, Padua & Garrett, 2000), ice hockey (e.g. Agel, Dompier, Dick & Marshall, 
2007), rugby (e.g. Hinton-Bayre, Geffen & Friis, 2004), and soccer (e.g. Dick, Putukian, Agel, 
Evans & Marshall, 2007); and have generally found higher rates of concussion in competition, 
and in collision sports (Zuckerman et al., 2015).  However, to date there are no concussion 
studies specific to synchronized swimming. 
Artistic (synchronized) swimming is a female-dominated aesthetic sport in which athletes 
compete against one another with routines set to music.  Judges score routines for technical 
execution, artistic impression, and difficulty.  Athletes compete in solo (one athlete), duet (two 
athletes), team (8 athletes) and combo (10 athletes) categories.  The sport, originally called 
“ornamental swimming or “scientific swimming” was developed from theatrical water ballet 
performances to include elements from lifesaving techniques and swimming, evolving into a 
very physically demanding full-contact sport (Federation Internationale de Natation, 2015).  
3 
 Since the Olympic debut of synchronized swimming in 1984 in which the three countries of 
Canada, United States of America and Japan participated (FINA, 2015), the sport has grown to 
be practiced by many countries on all 6 continents.  
In the last 20 years artistic swimming has evolved dramatically.  Routine choreography has 
become faster, the athletes must swim much closer to one another, and the aerial acrobatic moves 
are much higher and more powerful.  In addition, as training techniques have evolved athletes 
have become stronger and more powerful.  Due to these developments the chance of contact 
between the athletes has increased, and with it, the risk of injury.  Anecdotally, many participants 
(athletes, coaches and officials) believe that the evolution of artistic swimming has increased the 
risk of sustaining a concussion, and that concussions have become an issue in the sport.  In 
recent years there has been a push in Canada to develop and introduce management guidelines 
and protocols in an attempt to increase safety.  However, there is no sport-specific scientific 
evidence to inform the content of these policies.  Furthermore, the greatest increase in pediatric 
concussion-related doctor’s office and emergency department visits in Ontario between 2003 and 
2013 was among females (Zemek, 2017).  As a female-dominated sport, artistic swimming 
provides an opportunity to explore concussions in an under-studied population (McKeever & 
Schatz, 2003).  Together, the aforementioned highlights the importance of research in this area. 
 
1.2 Purpose 
The purpose of this program of research is two-fold.  First, to investigate the incidence and 
context of sport-related concussions sustained by amateur club-level artistic swimmers in 
Ontario.  Second, to conduct this investigation within the community in a collaborative 
partnership with community representatives and develop sport-specific concussion resources as 
partners.  The outcomes of the research will provide a vital starting point in terms of what the 
risk factors for sustaining a concussion in artistic swimming are, as well as assist in the 
development and evaluation of resources to promote the health and safety of artistic swimmers in 
Ontario.

 1.3 Research Question and Objectives 
The central research question of the research program is as follows: What is the frequency and 
context of concussions among youth female synchronized swimmers in Ontario?  There are five 
associated research objectives: (a) to determine the incidence of concussion injuries in this 
population in a single season, (b) to determine the seasonal training phase in which concussions 
are more frequent, (c) to determine if concussions are more common in any of the competitive 
age groups, (d) to describe which injury context factors are more frequently present in a 
concussion sustained during artistic swimming participation, and (e) to develop sport-specific 
concussion resources for the Ontario artistic swimming community through collaboration with 
the provincial sport organization.  
 
1.4 Rationale 
Answering this research question and addressing the associated research objectives will provide 
important information for artistic swimming officials in Ontario as the sport governing body 
develops and implements concussion safety guidelines. In addition, it will add to the 
understanding of what training contexts are more likely to lead to a concussion and provide a 
base for the development of sport-specific concussion prevention strategies.  Furthermore, it will 
provide important sport-specific concussion resources for artistic swimming coaches, officials, 
athletes, and their parents.  As artistic swimming continues to grow and advance, and the skills 
become faster, more powerful and more risky, this type of research and the resulting findings 
will become more and more important to protect the health and safety of the athletes.   
Despite the growth and evolution of the sport, artistic swimming is still widely considered a 
“fringe” sport by many (Battaglia, 2016).  Very little empirical research has been conducted on 
any aspect of the sport, let alone injuries in these athletes.  To date, no studies specifically 
examining concussion injuries in artistic/synchronized swimming have been published.  At this 
time, the extent of the issue of concussions in artistic swimming is unknown, and investigation 
into the scope and nature of concussions in this sport will be very important going forward.  It is 
vital to have empirical epidemiological data so that numbers of concussions can be tracked and 
the effect of any policies introduced by governing bodies can be measured.  Furthermore, it is 
5 
 imperative to understand the contexts surrounding concussions in artistic swimming in order to 
determine how best to manage these injuries in these athletes as well as how to prevent and 
minimize the risk of sustaining a concussion while participating in the sport.  Understanding 
which age group concussions are most frequent in, the time of year that athletes are most at risk 
for concussions, and what activities are most likely to lead to a concussion, will provide coaches 
with valuable information that can assist them in keeping their athletes safe. 
 
1.5 Outline 
This thesis is presented as a comprehensive document that can be read as a whole.  Alternatively, 
Chapters 4, 5, 6 and 7 are also able to be read as independent documents.  The thesis is 
comprised of nine chapters.  Following general introduction (Chapter 1), review of literature 
(Chapter 2), and research overview (Chapter 3) sections, there are four chapters presenting four 
separate research studies (Chapters 4-7). This is summarized by general discussion (Chapter 8) 
and conclusion (Chapter 9) sections.
 
6 Chapter 2  
Review of Literature 
The following section will review the existing literature on aspects of sport related concussion 
and the physiological characteristics of, and injuries in, artistic swimmers.  The mechanisms of 
concussive brain injury, the pathophysiological changes associated with mTBI and its clinical 
presentation, and the assessment and management of sports concussion will be discussed.  Sex 
and age differences in concussions will be described.   In addition, injury surveillance and 
concussion policy and education will be reviewed.   
 Review of Literature  
2.1 History of Artistic (Synchronized) Swimming  
The concept of synchronized swimming (aquatic performance set to music) has been in existence 
for over a century.  In Victorian England, ornamental swimming demonstrations featured men 
and women performing stunts and parlor tricks in large glass tanks (Valosik, 2016); however, it 
was quickly decided that women were better suited for the performances (FINA, 2015).  
Australian Annette Kellerman, the “mother of synchronized swimming”, brought aquatic 
performances to the United States in the early 1900s which featured combinations of swimming, 
dancing, acrobatics, and singing and were considered very avant-garde (Woollacott, 2011).  As 
these water pageants grew in popularity, the Red Cross began to use them as a way to increase 
interest in swimming and decrease the number of drowning deaths in the country (Valosik, 
2016).  The term ‘synchronized swimming’ was coined when an announcer introduced a water 
ballet performance at the 1934 World Fair in Chicago using that description (FINA, 2015).  
Water ballet continued to rise in popularity, culminating with Esther Williams, an American film 
star who performed in aquatic shows both live and on screen (Valosik, 2016).   
Meanwhile, the first competition of ‘scientific swimming’ (figures and strokes from the Royal 
Life Saving Society’s handbook) was held in Montreal, Canada in 1924 (FINA, 2015).  The 
progression of synchronized swimming from water pageantry to competitive sport continued in 
the mid-20th century, primarily in North America, and the sport was officially added to the FINA 
program in 1952 (FINA, 2015).  Following a long period of participating in the Olympics as a 
demonstration sport from 1952 to 1968, synchronized swimming was inducted into the Olympics 
7 
 in 1984 (FINA, 2015) and has since evolved far from its water ballet origins into a grueling 
athletic event (Valosik, 2016).  In 2018, FINA changed the name of the sport to artistic 
swimming. 
 
2.2 Physiology of Artistic (Synchronized) Swimmers 
To date, the existing literature on the physiological characteristics of synchronized swimmers is 
sparse and limited.  Some research investigated physiological factors related to synchro 
performance ability.  The earliest study that could be retrieved described the body composition 
of synchro athletes, in which the body fat and lean body weight of 15 synchronized swimmers 
were compared to 15 female non-athletes (Moffat, Katch, Freedson & Lindeman, 1980).  No 
statistically significant differences were found between the groups.  This study also compared 
ranked ability with body composition scores.  No relationship between ability and body fat or 
lean body weight was found.  A second study sought to determine which physiological 
characteristics of synchro athletes were related to their performance (Yamamura et al., 1999).  
Like the previous study, anthropometric variables were found to have no relation to synchronized 
swimming performance.  This could be because the inherent drive for sameness in the sport 
reduces the variation in physique of synchro athletes.  Yamamura and colleagues (1999) did find 
positive correlations between synchro performance and isokinetic muscle strength of the elbow 
in flexion and extension, isokinetic muscle strength of the knee in extension, abdominal muscle 
endurance, leg extension power, aerobic power, velocity at onset of blood lactate accumulation, 
and flexibility as measured by the distance between the open legs.  Another study investigated 
factors of rate of perceived exertion (RPE) in synchro competition performances and found that 
RPE was at least partially explained by the number of immersions in the routine, heart rate 
during recovery, minimum heart rate, and peak blood lactate levels (Rodriguez-Zamora et al., 
2014). 
Other researchers have looked at bone physiology in synchronized swimmers.  Liang, Arnaud, 
Steele, Hatch and Moreno (2005) compared bone strength between synchro athletes and 
gymnasts, in order to compare the bending stiffness of bone in world-class athletes with different 
histories of loading due to varying demands of different sports.  Synchronized swimmers and 
gymnasts were found to have similar levels of bone bending stiffness, and both groups had 
8 
 higher levels of this measure than untrained female controls.  A separate study found no 
difference in bone speed of sound or bone turnover between adolescent synchronized swimmers 
and age- and maturity-matched non-athlete controls (Ludwa, Falk, Yao, Corbett & Klentrou, 
2010).  This indicates that synchro training may increase bone stiffness without increasing bone 
density, which may have some implications for injury studies in synchronized swimming. 
A study comparing the effectiveness of post-exercise recovery methods on vagal reactivation in 
elite synchronized swimmers found that the performance of a routine significantly lowered 
parasympathetic tone and increased sympathetic activity, as indicated by changes in HRV 
measures (Schaal et al., 2013).  While limited by a small sample size, these findings show the 
high physical intensity experienced by synchronized swimmers during the practice of their sport, 
and suggest that the disruption of ANS function by concussion (e.g. Gall, Parkhouse & 
Goodman, 2004) could significantly hamper a synchronized swimmer’s ability to train and 
compete. 
 
2.3 Injuries in Artistic (Synchronized) Swimming 
Some studies that have examined injuries in athletes across multiple sports included synchro 
athletes (Andrade et al., 2010; Junge et al., 2009; Mountjoy et al., 2010; Mutoh, Takamoto & 
Miyashita, 1988).  One study describing the incidence of chronic injuries in all the aquatic sports 
(swimming, diving, water polo and synchronized swimming) found that 79% of the 24 
synchronized swimmers in the study had experienced at least one chronic injury (Mutoh et al., 
1988).  Of the reported injuries experienced by these synchro athletes, 45.2% were to the low 
back, 25.8% to the wrist, 12.9% to the knee, and 6.5% to the neck.  The athletes were not asked 
about concussion injuries in that study.  A second study examining frequency and type of injury 
in aquatic sports at the 2009 FINA World Championships found synchronized swimming had an 
injury rate of 28 injuries in 990 athlete exposures (Mountjoy et al., 2010).  This rate was in the 
middle of the pack as compared to the other aquatic sports. 
A study reporting the frequency and causes of athletic injuries among participants in the 2008 
Summer Olympic Games found that synchronized swimming was among the sports with the 
lowest number of reported injuries per participating athlete (Junge et al., 2009).  That being said, 
9 
 this study required team physicians to report injuries from their teams to the investigators.  It is 
possible that the team physicians for synchro did not pass on the injury information, or even that 
the athletes themselves did not report their injuries to team doctors for fear of being taken out of 
the Olympic competition.  McCrea et al. (2004) found that athletes may conceal injuries in order 
to stay in training and competition.  A study specifically examining dental trauma injuries in 
Pan-American Games athletes included 3 synchronized swimmers in the sample, and found that 
2 of these athletes had suffered dental trauma (Andrade et al., 2010).  This indicates that there is 
contact being made to the head and face during synchronized swimming, of an intensity 
sufficient to injure the teeth.  It is possible that this amount of force is enough to potentially 
cause a concussion injury.  Taken together, the findings of these various multi-sport studies 
indicate that synchronized swimmers do sustain injuries during training and competition for their 
sport.  
A handful of sport-specific injury studies have been published.  A very early descriptive study 
found that synchronized swimming had low risk of acute injuries, and a growing risk of over-use 
injuries (Weinberg, 1986).  However, this study was performed before synchro evolved to 
include more speed, power and riskier highlight manoeuvres.  Chu (1999) described the 
susceptibility of synchronized swimmers to lower back injury, shoulder injury, and medial stress 
injury in the knee due to synchro’s high strength, speed and flexibility demands.  Mountjoy 
(1999; 2009) has described the pattern of injuries associated with synchronized swimming in 
some detail.  She notes that the three most common musculoskeletal injuries in synchronized 
swimmers are: shoulder instability, lumbar strain, and patellofemoral syndrome (Mountjoy, 
1999).  Mountjoy (1999, 2009) is the first to describe the potential for acute traumatic injuries 
due to contact between synchronized swimmers, noting that the possibility for synchronized 
swimmers to sustain hematomas, contusions, fractures, disc herniations, and concussions is on 
the rise.  Furthermore, she suggests that due to the heavy training requirements and rigourous 
work ethic of elite synchronized swimmers, compliance with concussion management guidelines 
can be very challenging and this population should be identified as in need of education and 
close follow-up (Mountjoy, 2009).  While chronic overuse injuries are more common in 
synchronized swimming due to the high volume of repetitions needed to achieve perfect 
synchronization, there is a real risk of traumatic injuries due to collisions with teammates.  More 
rigourous empirical studies by injury type that look specifically at synchronized swimmers are 
10 
 needed to understand the extent of injuries in the sport.  No studies examining concussion 
injuries directly in synchronized swimming have been published to date.  This program of 
research has begun to close this gap in the literature.  Concussion is a potentially serious injury 
and proper tracking and management is important.  The nature of concussive brain injuries and 
the significance of concussion surveillance systems and concussion policies will be discussed in 
the following sections. 
 
2.4 Definition of Sport-Related Concussion 
Sport-related concussion (SRC) is a complex, heterogeneous injury.  It is the result of 
pathological metabolic changes in the brain, induced by biomechanical forces attendant to a 
direct or indirect blow to the head (McCrory et al., 2017).  Each concussion is unique, as the 
exact force, timing, and location of the impact will be different, as will each individual’s 
physiology, genetics, and history (Meaney & Smith, 2011).  Historically, loss of consciousness 
was regarded as a primary indicator of concussion injury, however modern definitions do not 
include loss of consciousness as a criterion for a concussion (McCrory et al., 2017).  While 
concussion injury has the potential to effect neuropathological changes, it is still considered to be 
chiefly a functional (vs. structural) injury (McCrory et al., 2017).  The diagnosis of concussion is 
made almost entirely on the clinical observation of signs and symptoms, and there is no 
established objective test to detect concussion.  Therefore, clinicians must rely on their own 
knowledge, understanding and experience to determine the presence of a concussion, and 
diagnosis may not be clear (Kutcher & Giza, 2014). 
 
2.5 Mechanism of Concussion Injury 
The kinematic parameters of the brain likely play a role in determining the likelihood of an 
injury, as they may help to predict the brain’s inertia (Duma & Rowson, 2014).  The two main 
categories of forces that cause TBI are contact and inertial (Meaney & Smith, 2011).  When the 
head makes direct contact with another surface, both contact and inertial forces are exerted on 
the brain, while head motions without direct contact result in inertial forces only (Meaney & 
Smith, 2011).  Inertial forces appear to be the principal cause of concussion injuries.  The 
11 
 component of the acceleration exerted on the brain with this inertial force can also play a role in 
brain injury.  When there is an impact to the head, the brain is acted on by both linear and 
rotational forces.  Research indicates that each of these forces seems to have a different and 
distinct effect on the brain, both of which contribute to the development of an injury.  The linear 
forces to the head induce a brief intracranial pressure gradient, whereas the rotational forces 
generate neural tissue strain in the brain (Duma & Rowson, 2014).  A cohort study of male high 
school and collegiate football players found that players who were subsequently diagnosed with 
a concussion following an impact experienced average peak linear acceleration of 112.1±35.4g 
and average peak rotational acceleration of 4253±2287rad/sec2 (Beckwith et al., 2013).  
However, a similar study of female collegiate ice hockey players found impacts associated with 
concussions had an average linear acceleration of only 43.0±11.5g and average rotational 
acceleration of 4030±1435rad/sec2 (Wilcox et al., 2015).  This suggests that the forces required 
to produce a concussion may be sex-specific, and furthermore that less linear acceleration of the 
head is needed to cause a concussion in females.  As synchronized swimming is an all-female 
sport, it is important that concussions be investigated in these athletes, as they may be more at 
risk for concussion simply because of their sex. 
Synchronized swimmers have the potential to experience both contact and inertial forces to the 
head, as they could directly strike their head against another surface/object/person, or experience 
indirect forces through impact to the body.  Direct contact could be experienced with their team 
mates during failed highlight maneuvers, pattern changes (rearranging of the athletes into 
different formations) and the execution of choreography while on the wrong count or in the 
wrong place in the pattern.  Direct contact with a surface or object could also be experienced 
through collision with the wall or bottom of the pool, or during dryland training.  Indirect forces 
would likely be less commonly experienced, however could be possible in some scenarios.  
Given all of these opportunities for contact, and that it appears that the amount of force needed to 
cause a concussion in females appears to be less than that needed in males, it is definitely 
possible that synchronized swimmers could be concussed during the practice of their sport. 
Numerous studies have examined mechanism of injury of concussion in collision and contact 
sports.  Descriptive epidemiological studies of concussion in multiple sports have identified 
contact with another athlete as the most common mechanism of injury at both the high school 
(Marar, McIlvain, Fields & Comstock, 2012; Meehan, d’Hemecourt, Collins & Comstock, 2011) 
12 
 and collegiate level (Zuckerman et al., 2015).  These studies were conducted in the United States 
and used data collected through national online injury surveillance systems.  Contact with 
another player was also identified as the most frequent mechanism of injury in a Canadian 
collegiate population, in a study that used interviews and viewing of game film to collect injury 
data (Delaney, Puni & Rouah, 2006).  A study of concussions in youth hockey comparing teams 
from Alberta and Quebec found player contact to be the mechanism of injury in the majority of 
concussions (Emery et al., 2010).  This comparison study also collected data from an online 
injury reporting system, to which each team’s athletic therapist reported concussions sustained 
by players on their team.  At a professional level, video analysis has been used to investigate the 
mechanism of injury in concussions in football (soccer) (Andersen, Arnason, Engebretsen & 
Bahr, 2004) and ice hockey (Hutchison, Comper, Meeuwisse & Echemendia, 2015).  Consistent 
with the findings from collegiate and youth athletes, Hutchison and colleagues (2015) found 
contact with another player to be the most common mechanism of injury. 
A concussion is primarily a functional injury.  Diagnostic imaging tests that use conventional 
technologies are negative the majority of the time (Bigler & Maxwell, 2012), meaning that there 
is no significant detectable structural damage to the brain.  In fact, any physical damage 
concomitant to mTBI occurs at the cellular level, on the scale of microns and nanometers 
(Bigler, 2014), too small to be detectable with computerized tomography (CT) scans or magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI).  New and emerging imaging technology is now able to capture this 
minute structural damage.  Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a form of MRI with a high enough 
resolution to image microstructural components of the brain.  DTI uses the differential diffusion 
of water molecules across different tissue types to produce an image (Basser & Jones, 2002).  
The principal use of DTI is for research purposes; however, the technique is potentially valuable 
as both a diagnostic and prognostic clinical tool (Gardner et al., 2012). 
The primary structural damage in mTBI appears to be in the white matter, with projecting axons 
being especially vulnerable to tensile strain from an impact (Bigler, 2014) due to their lattice-like 
morphology.  Effects from mild neuronal damage are temporary; as the severity of the structural 
damage to the neurons increases, so does the likelihood that there will be permanent deleterious 
effects (Bigler, 2014).  It is possible that myelination may confer a degree of protection to axons, 
as there is evidence that unmyelinated fibres may be more vulnerable to, and experience greater 
impairment from, fluid percussion injury (Reeves, Phillips & Povlishock, 2005). 
13 
 2.6 Pathophysiology of Concussion 
The microscopic injuries to the tissue induce a sequence of pathophysiological events in the 
neurons, which has been characterized as a neurometabolic cascade.  This cascade has been well 
described by Giza and Hovda (2001; 2014).  It was first defined in animal models, with parts 
now being substantiated in human studies (Giza & Hovda, 2014).  The biomechanical insult to 
the neurons initially produces an abnormal ion flux over the cell membrane coupled with 
uncontrolled excitatory neurotransmitter release (Giza & Hovda, 2014).  Disruption of the 
permeability of the neuronal cell membrane causes an influx of sodium and calcium ions with an 
efflux of potassium ions (Giza & Hovda, 2001).  This disturbs the ion gradient across the cell 
membrane.  Normally, the healthy neuron maintains the membrane ion gradient with the ATP-
dependent sodium-potassium pump.  This gradient is essential for proper neuron function, as the 
movement of ions across the membrane produces the depolarization and repolarization necessary 
to create action potentials.  The sudden and abnormal ion flux following a concussive blow 
induces depolarization of the cell membrane, which initiates the wholesale release of excitatory 
neurotransmitters, especially glutamate (Signoretti, Lazzarino, Tavazzi & Vagnozzi, 2011). 
In order to counteract the diffuse depolarization, the neurons attempt to restore the membrane 
gradient using the sodium-potassium pump, requiring large amounts of energy in the form of 
ATP.  This process is referred to as a period of hypermetabolism and results in hyperglycolysis 
and a depletion of cellular energy stores (Giza & Hovda, 2014).  Following the rapid and 
widespread depolarization, the brain undergoes the phenomenon of ‘spreading depression’, or 
inactivity (Hovda, Giza, Bergsneider & Vespa, 2014).  Concurrent with the increase in cellular 
energy demands, cerebral blood flow (which supplies oxygen and glucose) is often reduced due 
to the concussive blow, and an energy ‘mismatch’ ensues (Giza & Hovda, 2001).  This energy 
mismatch is compounded by the influx of calcium ions hampering the mitochondria’s ability to 
perform the redox reactions needed to produce ATP (Signoretti, Lazzarino, Tavazzi & Vagnozzi, 
2011).  The calcium ion flux can also activate cell death pathways and interfere with neural 
connectivity via disruption of neurofilaments and microtubules (Giza & Hovda, 2001).   
The hypermetabolism phase is followed by a hypometabolism phase caused by the energy 
mismatch, during which cells must use anaerobic respiration to produce energy as aerobic 
pathways are unavailable (Hovda, Giza, Bergsneider & Vespa, 2014).  This hypometabolism can 
14 
 last for as long as 28 days post-injury (Bergsneider et al., 2000), and causes a spike in cellular 
lactate and lactic acid, which in turn leads to acidosis and additional membrane breakdown, thus 
perpetuating the energy crises further (Hovda, Giza, Bergsneider & Vespa, 2014).  The 
metabolic deficit and depressed activity of the brain is believed to be the source of concussion-
associated impairments (Giza & Hovda, 2014).   
In addition to the metabolic mismatch and energy crises, other pathological processes occur in 
the neurons following a concussive impact.  Abnormally low cellular levels of magnesium have 
been observed, which can contribute to impaired ATP production as well as hamper protein 
synthesis and alter membrane receptors to promote further calcium influx (Giza & Hovda, 2001).  
Concussion alters both excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission, particularly through 
modification of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) 
neurons and receptors (Giza & Hovda, 2014).  Studies suggest a significant change in blood 
levels of brain injury biomarkers following a sport-related concussion (Bouvier et al., 2017; Di 
Battista et al., 2018; Shahim et al., 2014), however there is not enough evidence to date to 
support the use of biomarkers as a clinical assessment tool (McCrea et al., 2017).  
Neuroinflammation, as evidenced by higher than normal levels of cytokines, upregulated 
inflammatory genes, and activation of microglia, also appears to be present following concussive 
injury (Di Battista, Churchill, Rhind, Richards & Hutchison, 2019; Giza & Hovda, 2014). 
These disruptions all act to produce the constellation of signs and symptoms of concussion, and 
its observed effects.  Evidence indicates that cognition can be disrupted following a concussion. 
Acute cognitive impairment in terms of comparison to pre-injury neuropsychological scores has 
been found for at least two days following a concussive injury (Bleiberg et al., 2004).  A study of 
cognition in concussed symptomatic Australian Rules football players found dysfunction of 
motor systems and attention, but not of learning and memory (Collie, Makdissi, Maruff, Bennell 
& McCrory, 2006).  Guskiewicz, Ross and Marshall (2001) found concussed athletes had 
significantly lower scores on tests of postural stability and on certain cognitive tests than healthy 
controls one day after injury.  A meta-analysis of the neuro-cognitive impact of concussion 
found strong acute effects on the domains of delayed memory, memory acquisition, and global 
cognitive functioning (Belanger & Vanderploeg, 2005).  These effects had dissipated by seven 
days post-injury.  A case-control series study of cognitive performance of injured varsity athletes 
found that concussed athletes performed significantly worse than uninjured athletes on the Code 
15 
 Substitution Learning, Match to Sample, and Simple Reaction Time subtests of the Automated 
Neuropsychological Assessment Metrics (ANAM) (Hutchison, Comper, Mainwaring & 
Richards, 2011).  However, there was no significant difference in performance of the concussed 
athletes from that of athletes with musculoskeletal injuries on any of the ANAM subtests, 
indicating that it may be the state of being injured that disrupts cognitive function rather than a 
concussion specifically.  Teasing apart the effects of sport injury in general from the unique 
effects of a concussion injury remains one of the necessary focuses for future concussion 
research. 
Another hallmark of concussion pathophysiology is the disruption and dysfunction of the 
autonomic nervous system (ANS).  The ANS consists of two branches: the sympathetic nervous 
system (SNS) and the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS).  These branches have generally 
opposite functions and effects on the other body systems, and work together in concert to allow 
the body to react to the environment and to maintain homeostasis.  Control of the ANS is 
involuntary and input is from the central nervous system and feedback loops from other body 
systems.  The SNS, often considered the “fight or flight” system, has the general effect of 
mobilizing the body for action; for example heart rate, perspiration, and blood pressure increase, 
blood supply is increased to skeletal muscles and decreased to internal organs, and pupils and 
bronchioles are dilated.  The PNS, described as the “rest and digest” system, has roughly the 
opposite effects: heart rate decreases, blood flow increases to the intestinal tract and decreases to 
the periphery.   
When functioning normally, the SNS is fast-acting and reactive to environmental conditions 
while the PNS is slow-acting with a dampening effect on the SNS.  However, under conditions 
of chronic stress the function of the ANS is disrupted.  This is observed through elevated 
sympathetic tone, raised cortisol levels, and dampening of the baroreflex (Lucini, Di Fede, Parati 
& Pagani, 2005).  One objective marker used to measure ANS function is heart rate variability 
(HRV).  HRV is a measure of the variance in the interval between heart beats (Berntson et al., 
1997).  HRV measurement can be broken down into different frequency components.  The high 
frequency component is characterized as a measure of parasympathetic tone, the low frequency 
component as a measure of sympathetic tone or ANS balance, and the ratio between the two as 
an index of the interaction between the SNS and PNS (Xhyheri, Manfrini, Mazzolini, Pizzi & 
Bugiardini, 2012). 
16 
 An injury such as a concussion can be a very stressful experience for an athlete, and as such one 
would expect to observe autonomic dysfunction in concussed athletes.  Indeed, several studies of 
ANS activity in individuals with head injury have found a significant effect on HRV.  A study of 
HRV in patients with severe TBI found that those with decreased HRV and parasympathetic tone 
during the awakening period (period after removal of sedation) had worse neurological outcomes 
as compared to those with higher HRV and better parasympathetic tone (Rapenne et al., 2001).  
A comparison study of 14 concussed athletes and 14 matched controls found a difference in 
HRV during exercise, with the concussed group demonstrating lower levels of HRV compared to 
their matched controls, even when the concussed group’s symptoms had abated (Gall et al., 
2004).  A study of stress measures in concussed athletes from time of injury to post return-to-
play found significantly decreased HRV high frequency norm (a rough measure of 
parasympathetic activity) and significantly increased low frequency norm (rough measure of 
sympathetic activity) in the concussed group immediately (2-7 days) after injury, as compared to 
their matched controls (Senthinathan, 2013).  Interestingly, these disruptions in HRV resolved 
back to normal levels by the time the athletes returned to play.  These results indicate that there 
is some effect of concussion on autonomic function, particularly in the days following the injury, 
and that this dysfunction can be detected through HRV measurements.  Furthermore, the 
disruptions to HRV induced by concussion appear to be greater in female athletes, indicating that 
females may be more susceptible to parasympathetic dysfunction after a concussion (Hutchison 
et al., 2016).  This finding has particular significance for synchronized swimmers given Schaal et 
al.’s (2013) findings that synchronized swimming significantly decreases parasympathetic 
activity and increase sympathetic activity. 
In addition to findings of physiological markers of stress in concussed athletes, research has 
shown that concussed athletes exhibit elevated levels of psychological stress.  An athletic injury 
of any type can be very stressful for an athlete.  Injured collegiate athletes have higher levels of 
anxiety and depression and lower self-esteem than uninjured controls immediately following an 
injury and at a two-week follow-up (Leddy, Lambert & Ogles, 1994).  However, there do appear 
to be differences in the way athletes react to a concussion injury compared to an orthopaedic 
injury.  Mainwaring, Hutchison, Bisschop, Comper and Richards (2010) found different patterns 
of emotional disturbance post-injury between concussed and ACL-injured athletes.  This may be 
due to the unique physiological effects of a concussion on the brain, and/or may be from the 
17 
 differences in the post-injury experience.  Part of these differences is the current treatment 
practice of complete rest following a concussion.  One week post-injury, concussed athletes 
reported significantly lower levels of active, planning, acceptance, religion, self-distraction, 
venting, and self-blame coping strategies than athletes who had suffered an orthopaedic injury 
(Kontos, Elbin, Newcomer Appaneal, Covassin & Collins, 2013).  It is possible that the complete 
rest is preventing athletes from utilizing many of the coping strategies at their disposal and in 
turn causing higher levels of stress.  It is clear from these findings that concussed athletes are 
experiencing elevated levels of both physical and psychological stress following injury, and there 
is a need for more effective stress management strategies during the post-injury period. 
 
2.7 Concussion Assessment and Management 
While the search for a reliable biomarker of concussion continues, several objective methods of 
concussion assessment have been developed to assist clinicians in the evaluation and 
management of concussed athletes.  These approaches include neuropsychological tests, balance 
tests, and vestibulo-ocular assessments. 
The deleterious effect of concussion on balance has been consistently demonstrated.  
Guskiewicz, Perrin and Gansneder (1996) evaluated the effects of mild head injury on postural 
sway in high school and collegiate athletes using a computerized posturography system.  The 
mostly male injured participants showed significantly greater postural sway as compared to 
matched controls up to three days after sustaining a mild head injury.  Furthermore, a portion of 
the injured participants who performed pre-season screening showed a significant increase in 
postural sway on day one following injury compared to their pre-season scores, which resolved 
to baseline by day three to five post-injury.  Guskiewicz, Ross and Marshall (2001) reported 
changes in postural stability in concussed collegiate athletes using two different methods, a 
sensory organization test (SOT) performed on a computerized forceplate and the Balance Error 
Scoring System (BESS).  Concussed athletes were found to have significantly worse SOT scores 
on day one post-concussion as compared to their baseline scores, and significantly worse scores 
as compared to controls at one, three and five days post-concussion.  A similar pattern of results 
was observed on the BESS, with significantly worse scores compared to baseline on day one 
18 
 post-concussion, and significantly worse scores compared to controls at one, three and five days 
following concussion. 
There is some evidence to indicate that balance deficits associated with concussion may be 
related to symptoms.  A study of balance in concussed collegiate athletes grouped by their report 
of headache (PTH) following concussion found that the presence of PTH had a significant effect 
on postural sway (Register-Mihalik, Mihalik & Guskiewwicz, 2008).  Similarly, correlation 
between self-reported ‘dizziness’ and SOT scores in concussed collegiate athletes has also been 
reported (Broglio, Sosnoff & Ferrara, 2008).  Balance changes following concussion may also be 
modulated by age and sex.  In a study of concussed high school and collegiate athletes, high 
school males scored slightly worse on the BESS than high school females, and collegiate females 
scored significantly worse than collegiate males (Covassin, Elbin, Harris, Parker & Kontos, 
2012).  In addition, high school males scored significantly worse on the BESS than collegiate 
males, while high school females scored significantly better than collegiate females.  Howell, 
Osternig and Chou (2015) compared dual-task gait balance control performance following 
concussion in adolescents and young adults.  At 72 hours post-concussion there was a significant 
difference in gait balance control between concussed versus healthy adolescents, however no 
significant difference was observed between the concussed and healthy young adults.  
Furthermore, the difference in performance between the concussed and healthy adolescents 
persisted for the entire two month testing period.  Benedict and colleagues (2015) found older 
age to be associated with worse scores on the BESS following concussion, but no significant 
relationship between gender and BESS scores in concussed patients at a multidisciplinary 
concussion center.  No significant sex differences in BESS scores were reported in a younger 
(mean age around 14 years) sample of concussion patients (Sufrinko et al., 2017), suggesting that 
the effects of sex on balance post-concussion may not emerge until after adolescence.   
The inconsistency of the findings relating to the influence of age and sex on balance following 
concussion may be related to the variety of methods through which it is assessed.  In a systematic 
review of the validity and reliability of balance tests in concussed athletes that included literature 
on the BESS, SOT, Clinical Test of Sensory Organization and Balance (CTSIB), the Romberg 
test and the Wii Fit, the BESS was the only test that had reliability and validity evidence for use 
in the target population of concussed athletes (Murray, Salvatore, Powell & Reed-Jones, 2014).  
Furman and colleagues (2013) compared the BESS with the National Institute of Health’s 
19 
 Balance Accelerometer Measure (BAM) in the ability to distinguish acutely concussed, non-
acutely concussed, and healthy controls in a sample of adolescent athletes.  They reported the 
BAM could only weakly differentiate non-acutely concussed patients from controls, and could 
not distinguish between acutely concussed patients and controls.  Conversely, the BESS 
identified both acutely and non-acutely concussed patients from controls.  While these findings 
seem to indicate the BESS is the best test to use in concussion assessment in athletes, some 
reports call that into question.  Practice effects have been reported in both high school and 
collegiate athletes with repeated administration of the BESS (Mulligan, Boland & McIlhenny, 
2013; Valovich, Perrin & Gansneder, 2003), as would be the case in an athlete population that 
undergoes seasonal baseline testing.  In order to increase the sensitivity of the BESS to detect 
subtle balance changes post-concussion, King and colleagues (2014) suggested introducing an 
inertial sensor worn on the lumbar spine while performing the test.  This ‘instrumented BESS’ 
has been found to have superior diagnostic ability compared to the clinical BESS score in both 
chronic (King et al., 2014) and acutely concussed patients (King et al., 2017).   
It is consistently demonstrated in the literature that concussion has an effect on objective 
measures of balance and postural stability.  Balance tests, especially the BESS, are an important 
part of comprehensive concussion management and can assist clinicians in monitoring an 
athlete’s recovery following concussion. 
Deficits in vestibular and ocular functioning following concussion have also been consistently 
demonstrated.  A retrospective review of pediatric patients with acute sport-related concussion or 
post-concussion syndrome (PCS) found that 29% of acutely concussed patients and 63% of PCS 
patients met study criteria for vestibule-ocular dysfunction, defined as the presence of at least 
one subjective complaint and one abnormal result on vestibular/ocular assessment (Ellis et al., 
2015).  Furthermore, the same study found that a concussed athlete’s odds of developing PCS 
increased with the diagnosis of vestibule-ocular function (Ellis et al., 2015).  Other retrospective 
reviews of youth sport-related concussion patients have reported that those with abnormal 
vestibulo-ocular signs at the time of initial evaluation after the concussion take longer to recover 
than those without (Anzalone et al., 2017; Corwin et al., 2015).  Patients with a history of three 
or more previous concussions had a higher prevalence of vestibular dysfunction, and took longer 
for those signs to resolve, than patients with a history of two or fewer concussions (Corwin et al., 
2015).  The test commonly used in these studies is the Vestibular/Ocular Motor Screening 
20 
 Assessment (VOMS), which consists of assessments of five domains: smooth pursuits, 
horizontal and vertical saccades, convergence, horizontal vestibular ocular reflex and visual 
motion sensitivity (Mucha et al., 2014).  Studies of the VOMS have reported high internal 
consistency and a false positive rate of 2-11% (Kontos, Sufrinko, Elbin, Puskar & Collins, 2016; 
Worts, Schatz & Burkhart, 2018), as well as an ability to identify concussion in adolescent 
athletes (Mucha et al., 2014).   
Another vision test widely studied in sport-concussion research is the King-Devick test (K-D).  
The K-D was originally developed to assess reading abilities through the detection of changes in 
saccadic rhythm (Lieberman, Cohen & Rubin, 1983).  It involves rapid naming of strings of 
numbers in horizontal rows; response times and number of errors are counted (Kulp & Schmidt, 
1997).  Worsened K-D scores following concussion have been reported in numerous sports and 
in youth, collegiate and adult athletes, including adult boxers and mixed martial arts fighters 
(Galetta et al., 2011a), adult and junior club-level rugby athletes (King, Brughelli, Hume & 
Gissane, 2013; King, Hume, Gissane & Clark, 2015), collegiate football athletes (Galetta et al., 
2011b; Leong et al., 2015), collegiate soccer and basketball athletes (Galetta et al., 2011b), and 
adolescent football athletes (Seidman et al., 2015).  A meta-analysis of the K-D test in sports 
concussion reported weighted estimates of a 4.8 second increase (worsening) in K-D scores 
following concussion and a 1.9 second improvement in K-D scores in control athletes at re-test 
(Galetta et al., 2016).  The meta-analysis also reported a pooled sensitivity of 86% and 90% 
pooled specificity (Galetta et al., 2016).  These findings seem to indicate that the K-D test is an 
effective sideline test for detecting concussion.  However, in a comparison of K-D scores 
between mTBI patients to non-head inured patients presenting to an emergency department, 
there was no significant differences between K-D scores of each group and regression analysis 
indicated that K-D scores did not contribute over any other measure for predicting the presence 
of mTBI (Silverberg, Luoto, Öhman & Iverson, 2014).  Furthermore, Worts et al. (2018) 
reported a false positive rate for the K-D test of 36% in a sample of healthy high-school athletes.  
Despite this, the literature to date appears to support the use of test such as the VOMS and K-D 
to assist in the detection of ocular/vestibular dysfunction associated with sport-related 
concussion. 
Perhaps the most widely used objective assessment in concussion are neuropsychological (NP) 
tests.  These batteries typically consist of several tests of different components of 
21 
 neuropsychological functioning and can be computerized or paper and pencil.  Commonly used 
NP tests include the Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment for Cognitive Testing (ImPACT), 
the Sport Concussion Assessment Tool- 5th Edition (SCAT5 and Child SCAT5), the Automated 
Neuropsychological Assessment Metrics (ANAM) and CogSport/CogState.  A survey of schools 
participating in the High School Reporting Information Online (HS RIO) injury surveillance 
system found 39.9% of participating schools reported using computerized NP testing in 
concussion management (Meehan III, d’Hemecourt, Collins, Taylor & Comstock, 2012).  
Another survey of high school and collegiate athletic trainers reported that 94.7% of respondents 
administered baseline NP tests to athletes, while 87.5% of respondents used NP testing to assess 
concussions (Covassin, Elbin, Stiller-Ostrowski & Kontos, 2009).   
Baseline NP testing refers to the practice of administering cognitive tests to athletes before a 
season begins to establish a pre-concussion ‘baseline’ score.  The rationale for this approach is 
that the test can be re-administered if an athlete sustains a concussion during the season and the 
scores compared to their individual baseline scores as a marker of cognitive recovery.  This 
approach has been criticized for not modifying concussion risk, being cost prohibitive in terms of 
time and money, being vulnerable to numerous sources of random error and potentially creating 
a false sense of confidence in clinicians using these tests to determine when an athlete is ready to 
return to play (Resch, McCrea & Cullum, 2013).  Nevertheless, baseline testing is a prevalent 
practice at many different levels of sport participation and is used as part of the procedure in 
many research studies. 
There is consistent evidence in the literature that suffering a concussion has an effect on athletes’ 
NP test scores.  A study of 64 high school athletes found significantly worsened ImPACT 
memory scores at 36 hours and days 4 and 7 following concussion as compared to their baseline 
scores (Lovell et al., 2003).  Similar findings were reported in a larger sample comprised of 104 
concussed high school and collegiate athletes that compared ImPACT scores at day 2, 7 and 14 
post-concussion to baseline values (McClincy, Lovell, Pardini, Collins & Spore, 2006).  These 
athletes had significantly worse verbal memory, visual memory, processing speed and reaction 
time scores at day 2 post-concussion, with the significant decreases in visual memory and 
reaction time scores persisting at day 7 and verbal memory scores at day 14 post-injury 
(McClincy et al., 2006).  Freshman boxers who sustained a concussion during the academic year 
demonstrated impaired performance on the ANAM on the day of injury and on days 1 to 2 post-
22 
 concussion (Bleiberg et al., 2004).  A prospective study of concussion recovery in male high 
school and collegiate athletes reported significant differences from baseline scores on 
components of the SAC, ANAM, and ImPACT at 24 hours post-concussion (Wang et al., 2016).  
Adolescent lacrosse and soccer players demonstrated a significant decrease in all ImPACT 
composite scores within three days of concussion as compared to their baseline scores (Sandel, 
Schatz, Goldberg & Lazar, 2017).  The apparent robust effect of concussion on 
neuropsychological functioning suggests that NP testing is a viable assessment strategy in 
concussion management, and could assist in helping athletes return to play safely.  Meehan, 
d’Hemecourt and Comstock (2010) reported that athletes whose concussions were reported to 
HS-RIO and had NP testing were less likely to return to play on the same day or in less than one 
week than athletes that did not receive it. 
Research also suggests correlations between NP functioning and other markers used in 
concussion assessment.  Benedict et al. (2015) found higher symptom severity scores were 
associated with lower SAC scores and higher K-D scores were associated with worse SAC 
immediate memory scores in concussion center patients.  In a retrospective cohort study of 
pediatric concussion patients, those with abnormal gaze stability or tandem gait scores on intake 
also scored lower on the neurocognitive aspects of ImPACT, and took longer for their scores to 
resolve to baseline (Corwin et al., 2015).  Pearce and colleagues (2015) found convergence 
insufficiency was associated with lower scores on the verbal memory, visual motor speed and 
reaction time components of the ImPACT in concussed youth athletes.  Overall, evidence 
suggests that NP testing can enhance the safe management of sport concussion, but should not be 
used in isolation as the sole determinant of concussion status or recovery (Resch, McCrea & 
Cullum, 2013). 
Current opinion is that the most effective concussion assessment protocols would include 
multiple modes of assessment.  A comprehensive concussion management plan includes clinical 
sign and symptom evaluations, NP testing, balance assessment and/or vestibulo-ocular tests.  
This multi-modal approach has been recommended by multiple governing associations and 
expert panels (Broglio et al., 2014; Giza et al., 2013; Harmon et al., 2019; McCrory et al., 2017).  
However, it should be noted that many athletes, especially those participating in sport at a 
grassroots or community level, may not have access to the resources required to receive that 
standard of care.

Until recently, clinical practice guidelines emphasized physical and cognitive rest following a 
concussion.  The return to activity guidelines authored by the Concussion in Sport group 
(McCrory et al., 2013) emphasized rest as the ‘cornerstone’ of concussion management and 
indicate that complete rest should continue until an athlete is asymptomatic.  According to these 
guidelines, once an athlete is asymptomatic at rest they may begin a graded exercise progression 
to return to play that involves a gradual increase in intensity and duration of activity, only 
progressing to the next stage if they are able to complete the current stage symptom-free 
(McCrory et al., 2013).  Other current sport concussion treatment guidelines from the American 
Academy of Neurology (Giza et al., 2013), the American Medical Society (Harmon et al., 2013), 
and the National Athletic Trainers Association (Broglio et al., 2014) also emphasized rest until 
symptoms have eased and a gradual progression towards full activity.  The most recent 
consensus statement from the CiSG indicates that complete rest beyond the initial 24-48 hours 
following a sport concussion is not supported by empirical evidence, and that gradually resuming 
activity at a level that does not induce symptoms may be more beneficial (McCrory et al., 2017). 
The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying concussion provide part of the rationale behind 
the treatment practice of prescribed rest.  Research indicates that the majority of axonal damage 
and cellular disruption that occurs with a concussion can be resolved with a full return to 
function, given sufficient time (Grady, Master & Gioia, 2012).  Thus a large part of the rationale 
for rest is that in order to promote full structural and functional recovery during a post-injury 
period characterized as a metabolic mismatch, one must avoid putting further metabolic demands 
on the brain (Silverberg & Iverson, 2013).  Exercise and activity appears to exacerbate 
symptoms, especially shortly after the injury, which has been taken as evidence to support rest 
(Silverberg & Iverson, 2013).  Furthermore, past research has suggested the brain may be more 
vulnerable to further injury during this period, and as such activities that may confer risk of a 
second impact should be avoided (Wells, Goodkin & Griesbach, 2015).  However, evidence for 
this is equivocal, with other research finding that the second impact phenomenon may not exist 
(Hebert et al., 2016). 
Results from animal studies appear to support an initial rest period.  Forced activity during the 
first seven days following brain lesion in rats resulted in worsening of the neuronal injury and 
24 
 impaired return of function, while the same activity implemented after seven days only affected 
functioning (Humm, Kozlowski, James, Gotts & Schallert, 1998).  A study using a fluid 
percussion injury (FPI) rat model found lower levels of exercise-dependent neuroplastic factors 
and higher levels of cognitive impairment in rats that were exercised immediately after injury, as 
compared to sham (uninjured) rats, sedentary injured rats and injured rats that were exercised 
after a 14 day delay (Griesbach, Hovda, Molteni, Wu & Gomez-Pinilla, 2004).   
In contrast, there is a lack of evidence in humans to support a period of rest following a 
concussion.  One retrospective study assigned concussed high school and collegiate athletes who 
had been prescribed a week of cognitive and physical rest into one of three groups based on 
timing of rest prescription after the injury.  Results found that both symptom scores and 
Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment & Cogntive Testing (ImPACT) measures significantly 
improved following a prescribed rest period, regardless of how long after the injury the rest was 
prescribed (Moser, Glatts & Schatz, 2012).  However, with no comparison group, it cannot be 
concluded for certain that rest in and of itself produced the improvements, which may have 
simply been due to the passage of time.  Furthermore, a subset of concussed athletes who were 
prescribed additional rest beyond the one week showed no difference in symptom scores after the 
extra rest compared to the group who only performed the initial rest.  Another retrospective study 
with student-athletes used self-report and found that athletes who engaged in a moderate level of 
activity after a concussion had better neurocognitive outcomes than athletes who engaged in 
either no or high levels of activity (Majerske et al., 2008).  Furthermore, a randomized control 
trial of emergency room mTBI patients found no significant differences between patients who 
underwent full bed rest for six days and patients who had no bed rest in post-traumatic 
complaints at two weeks, three months, or six months (de Kruijk, Leffers, Meerhoff, Rutten & 
Twijnstra, 2002).  Results from these studies indicate at best a very weak effect of rest, and taken 
together fail to reliably demonstrate that rest is of significant benefit after a concussion. 
There are several outstanding issues with the designation of complete rest as a gold-standard for 
concussion management.  Overall, there is a lack of high-quality evidence for the utility of rest 
after a concussion.  A systematic review of the effect of rest and treatment in sport concussion 
management found that while an initial rest period is potentially favourable, overall evidence for 
rest following a concussion is scant (Schneider et al., 2013).  A later review of clinical trials also 
highlighted the lack of methodologically rigourous studies directly examining principles of 
25 
 return to activity (RTA), including rest (Burke, Fralick, Nejatbakhsh, Tartaglia & Tator, 2015).  
Furthermore, there is a lack of any clear standardized definitions of what ‘complete rest’ entails.  
In order for the field to progress to more evidence-based management strategies there must be a 
consensus on the definition of rest.  Finally, there is some controversy over the reliance on 
symptoms to guide recovery decisions.  Some research appears to indicate that the presence or 
absence of symptoms is not an accurate indication of the underlying physiological state.  There 
are low levels of symptoms typically associated with post-concussion (e.g. dizziness, headache, 
etc.) present in other injured and medical populations, in the general population when exercising, 
and even in the general population at rest (Alla, Sullivan & McCrory, 2012).  Various 
neurophysiological measures have been found to remain abnormal beyond the “recovery” of 
clinical signs and symptoms.  Electroencephalogram (EEG) measures of brain activity in 
concussed athletes remained significantly different from uninjured controls eight days after 
injury, even though symptom scores were no longer different from those of controls (Barr, 
Prichep, Chabot, Powell & McCrea, 2012).  Slobounov et al. (2011) found dysfunction of 
hemispheric connectivity in concussed athletes who were asymptomatic on both clinical 
evaluations and neuropsychological tests.  A study monitoring concussions in a collegiate 
football team found a subset of athletes who did not display any outward signs of a concussion 
and as such were never diagnosed with or treated for one, who had significantly reduced scores 
on neurocognitive domains of the ImPACT assessment and significantly decreased brain 
activation during an fMRI cognitive task (Talavage et al., 2014).  Taken together, these findings 
indicate that symptoms may be a poor indicator of underlying neurophysiological and functional 
status. 
More recently, opinion has shifted to consider that complete rest may actually have detrimental 
effects.  A 2015 review identified the following potentially harmful effects of protracted rest 
following a concussion: anxiety, depression, the “nocebo” effect (development of illness due to 
expectations of illness), physical deconditioning and exercise tolerance, and negative impact on 
psychological well-being (DiFazio, Silverberg, Kirkwood, Bernier & Iverson, 2015).   
Due to these realizations, some researchers have been investigating the potential role for exercise 
in concussion recovery.  Exercise has been introduced as a therapy in many conditions that the 
previous standard of practice has been to prescribe rest.  Favourable effects of exercise have been 
found in low back pain (Deyo, Diehl & Rosenthal, 1986), neuropathic pain (Dobson, McMillan 
26 
 & Li, 2014), whiplash (Schnabel, Ferrari, Vassiliou & Kaluza, 2004), and stroke (Billinger et al., 
2014), as well as in several neurodegenerative disease contexts such as Parkinson’s disease 
(Ebersbach, 2015), multiple sclerosis (Motl & Sandroff, 2015), and Alzheimer’s disease 
(Frederikson, Sobol, Beyer, Hasselbach & Waldemar, 2014).  In addition, there is already some 
evidence to support the use of exercise in a concussion context.  Leddy and colleagues (2010) 
conducted a pilot study examining the effects of a sub-symptom threshold treadmill exercise 
program in six athletes and six non-athletes with refractory post-concussion syndrome (PCS), 
and found a significant reduction in symptom score after the treatment period.  Another study 
with slow to recover concussed adolescents found that concussion symptoms and mood 
improved and fatigue was decreased following an active intervention using light aerobic 
exercise, co-ordination exercises, mental imagery and stress reduction (Gagnon, Grilli, Friedman 
& Iverson, 2015).  A review of the literature on the use of the Buffalo Concussion Treadmill Test 
and the Buffalo Concussion Bike Test found that identifying an individualized ‘dose’ of sub-
symptom threshold exercise can speed recovery in post-concussion syndrome, and potentially in 
acute concussion as well (Leddy, Haider, Ellis & Willer, 2018).  These results indicate the 
potential for exercise to be used during the post-concussion rehabilitation period.  However, 
despite some indications that rest may not be the best management strategy, to date the evidence 
is not yet robust enough to replace the existing standards. 
This literature is significant given that governing bodies in synchronized swimming are 
beginning to develop synchro-specific ‘return to pool’ guidelines for concussion management.  It 
is important for the health and safety of the athletes that these guidelines are based on the most 
up-to-date knowledge and understanding of the most effective concussion management 
strategies. 
 
2.8 Sex- and Age-Related Differences in Concussion 
Sex differences have been consistently observed in the sport concussion literature in terms of 
occurrence, symptoms, performance on assessments, and course of recovery.   It is often reported 
that the rate of concussion is higher in females than males in comparable sports, however other 
findings contradict that assertion.  In a review of concussion sex differences in adults, Merritt, 
Padgett and Jak (2019) found that within studies of soccer, basketball and baseball/softball the 
27 
 overall finding is that female concussion rates are higher.  However, findings from ice hockey 
and lacrosse are equivocal, with some studies finding no significant differences, some reporting 
higher rates in males and some higher rates in females (Merritt et al., 2019).   
There appears to be a robust effect of sex on concussion symptom profiles.  Covassin et al. 
(2006) found that females were significantly more likely than males to endorse 14 of the 
concussion symptoms on the ImPACT at baseline amongst 1209 American collegiate athletes.  A 
similar pattern of results were reported in a sample of 260 Canadian collegiate athletes, in which 
women had a higher mean Post-Concussion Symptom Score (PCSS) than men and lower number 
of total ‘0’s (Shehata et al., 2009).  The same trend has been reported in athletes post-concussion.  
A prospective cohort study of high school and collegiate athletes reported more symptoms in 
females than males following concussion (Covassin, Elbin, Harris, Parker & Kontos, 2012).  An 
exploratory factor analysis of the PCSS at baseline and post-concussion for samples of high 
school and collegiate athletes found that females reported higher levels of cognitive-sensory, 
sleep-arousal, vestibular-headache and affective symptom factors than males (Kontos et al., 
2012).  In a retrospective review of 37 concussed youth athletes, Berz and colleagues (2013) 
reported males had a lower initial symptom score than females, however no significant sex 
differences were found on any individual symptom scores or in recovery rate.  A meta-analysis 
of 21 cohort studies determined that females were 43% more likely than males to report any 
symptom at baseline, and had higher odds of reporting difficulty concentrating, problems with 
hearing/vision, headache/migraine, emotional disturbance and sleep/energy disturbances (Brown, 
Elsass, Miller, Reed & Reneker, 2015).  However, no significant sex differences in symptom 
reporting were detected following concussion (Brown et al., 2015).  Baker et al. (2015) reported 
that female high school athletes took significantly longer to become asymptomatic following a 
concussion than male high school athletes.  A prospective study examining sex differences in the 
ImPACT pre- and post-concussion in a pediatric population reported an opposite pattern 
(Tanveer, Zecavati, Delasobera & Oyegbile, 2017).  Males were more likely post-concussion to 
experience loss of consciousness, confusion and amnesia of before and after event, while females 
had a higher total symptom score; however, there were no significant sex differences found at 
baseline (Tanveer et al., 2017).  
Sex differences have been reported in other post-concussion outcomes as well.  Broshek et al. 
(2005) reported that along with a greater number of symptoms, females also demonstrate greater 
28 
 cognitive impairment following concussion than males.  Female athletes were found to have 
higher horizontal scores on the vestibular ocular reflex component of the Vestibular/Ocular 
Motor Screening tool than male athletes post-concussion, indicative of greater vestibulo-ocular 
dysfunction (Sufrinko et al., 2017).  Sex differences in the location of white matter abnormalities 
have also been reported in mTBI patients (Fakhran, Yaeger, Collins & Alhilali, 2014). 
Moving beyond physiological differences, there also appear to be sex differences in concussion 
knowledge and reporting.  A study of concussion knowledge and reporting in high school 
athletes found sex differences in levels of concussion knowledge, with females demonstrating 
significantly higher levels than males, as well as sex differences in reasons for not reporting a 
concussion (Wallace, Covassin & Beidler, 2017).  Female athletes have also been reported to 
have higher reporting intention than male athletes without any difference in the likelihood that 
they will continue to play with concussion symptoms (Kroshus, Baugh, Stein, Austin & Calzo, 
2017). 
 Research suggests differences between male and female athletes in terms of concussion 
vulnerability, symptoms, post-concussion cognitive and physiological effect, and concussion 
knowledge and reporting behaviour.  These differences indicate a need to consider athlete sex 
when conducting concussion research and implementing concussion education and resources. 
Age differences have also been consistently reported in the concussion literature.  A comparison 
of concussion recovery in high school and collegiate athletes reported a longer duration of post-
concussion cognitive dysfunction in the high school athletes, even though the collegiate athletes’ 
concussions were deemed to be more severe (Field, Collins, Lovell & Maroon, 2003).  
Zuckerman et al. (2012) found adolescent athletes took a longer time on average to return to 
baseline measures of three ImPACT measures and post-concussion symptom scale, as compared 
to the average recovery time of young adult athletes.  A systematic review and meta-analysis of 
concussion recovery time in high school and collegiate athletes found that high school athletes 
self-reported symptom recovery at 15 days, while collegiate athletes self-reported symptom 
recovery at just 6 days post-concussion (Williams, Puetz, Giza & Broglio, 2015).  However, 
when recovery was measured in terms of neuropsychological test results, recovery times were 
very similar between high school and collegiate athletes (Williams et al., 2015).  It is important 
to note that this review and meta-analysis was only comprised of six studies.  A review including 
29 
 11 studies reported there is evidence that young athletes take longer to recover than their older 
peers in terms of both neuropsychological test results and symptoms; however, there is not 
sufficient evidence to indicate that younger age increases the risk of prolonged (> 4 weeks) 
recovery (Foley, Gregory & Solomon, 2014).   
Baillargeon, Lassonde, Leclerc and Ellemberg (2012) reported a greater reduction in P3b 
amplitude (an event-related potential evoked by an oddball task) in concussed adolescents than 
concussed children or concussed adolescents.  Covassin et al. (2012) found age-related 
differences in performance on memory tasks and balance tests following concussion.  High 
school athletes scored significantly worse than collegiate athletes on verbal memory at two and 
seven days post-concussion and visual memory at two days post-concussion (Covassin et al., 
2012).  A comparison of dual-task gait balance control deficits in adolescents and young adults 
post-concussion reported that adolescents experienced greater deficits both initially and 
throughout the two month recovery period as compared to matched controls (Howell, Osternig & 
Chou, 2014). 
However, other studies examining age differences in concussion have not reported significant 
differences.  In a comparison of symptom scores of 13-16 year old and 18-22 year old athletes at 
baseline and following concussion, no significant differences were found between age groups for 
presence of symptoms, severity of symptoms, total symptom scores or in the return to baseline 
scores (Lee, Odom, Zuckerman, Solomon & Sills, 2013).  Nelson and colleagues (2016) 
examined age differences in the acute recovery following concussion in collegiate and high 
school athletes, and reported no clinically significant age differences in acute recovery course. 
Overall, research findings point towards an effect of an athlete’s age on concussion recovery and 
post-concussion cognition.  This suggests age should be taken into consideration in concussion 
research and clinical practice.  Taken together with the findings of the effects of athlete sex in 
concussion, this points towards targeting concussion resources and interventions to the specific 
population of interest.  In Ontario, artistic swimmers are almost all female and adolescent or 
younger.  Any concussion prevention efforts or resource implementation should be based on 
findings from young, female athletes.  Ideally, this basis would be findings from the Ontario 
artistic swimmers themselves.  This supports the need for sport-specific concussion research in 
the province.

2.9 Injury Surveillance Programs 
In regards to health-related topics, a surveillance system is typically used in public health 
settings to collect ongoing data, analyze that data, interpret the results and circulate those results 
(Holder et al., 2001).  Injury surveillance programs have several benefits, including the ability to 
craft and implement interventions and monitor the impact of said interventions, the appropriate 
allocation of resources, and the ability for different organizations to compare data and assist one 
another (Holder et al., 2001).  Injury surveillance is an important step in a ‘sequence of 
prevention’ of sport injuries (van Mechelen, 1997).  Step one in the sequence is identifying the 
problem and describing injury incidence and severity, step two is to recognize the mechanisms 
and factors leading to injury, this is followed by the introduction of preventative measures and 
the evaluation of those measures (van Mechelen, Hlobil & Kemper, 1987).  While a general 
injury surveillance system can be valuable in evaluating the incidence and severity of a sports 
injury problem, the diversity of injuries across different sports makes it incredibly difficult to 
capture all the potential risk factors for all sports in one system, suggesting that sport-specific 
surveillance is needed for specific research problems (van Mechelen, 1997). 
Injury surveillance systems have been implemented by many different sport organizations.  
Surveillance has been used by the International Rugby Board (IRB), the Federation 
Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), the International Olympic Committee (IOC), the 
National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), U Sports (formerly Canadian Interuniversity 
Sport), and the National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS).  The IRB 
established a Rugby Injury Consensus Group (RICG), which produced a consensus statement on 
the definitions and procedures related to the study of injuries in rugby union (Fuller et al., 2007).  
An injury surveillance system for rugby union was created based on the standardized definitions 
and methodologies specified by the RICG, and was implemented to record the incidence, 
mechanisms and factors associated with injuries at the 2007 IRB Rugby World Cup (Fuller, 
Laborde, Leather & Molloy, 2008).  The IRB’s consensus statement was based on a consensus 
statement on injury definitions and research procedures for football (soccer) (Fuller et al., 2007).  
Following the First World Congress on Sports Injury Prevention, FIFA put together a working 
group to establish a consensus statement regarding the associated definitions and identification of 
31 
 the issues surrounding reporting and data collection in football injuries (Fuller et al., 2006).  The 
Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) also developed the UEFA model for 
descriptive injury epidemiology studies in professional football for use in football-specific injury 
surveillance (Hӓgglund, Waldén, Bahr & Ekstrand (2005).  The UEFA football safety research 
project was comprised of three stages: consensus discussions within the UEFA Medical 
Committee, two pilot studies and approval of the design and forms by team doctors (Hӓgglund et 
al., 2005).  Whereas the systems for football and rugby were developed to be specific to those 
sports, the IOC needed a surveillance system that could be used across a wide variety of sports 
(Junge et al., 2008).  The IOC adapted a surveillance system used in international football and 
handball tournaments and piloted its use in team sport events at the 2004 Olympic Games (Junge 
et al., 2006).  This system was modified to also be applicable to individual sports and used for all 
sports in the 2008 Olympic Games (Junge et al., 2008). 
Academic athletic associations have also developed and implemented injury surveillance 
systems.  The governing body of Canadian inter-university sport, now called U Sports, 
developed and implemented the Canadian Intercollegiate Sport Injury Registry (CISIR) to 
measure injury rates and athlete risk and serve as an outcome measure for prevention efforts 
(Meeuwisse & Love, 1998).  The system was initially developed to be specific to the sport of 
football, with the intention of extending it to additional sports (Meeuwisse & Love, 1998).  The 
American counterpart, the NCAA, has developed its own Injury Surveillance System (ISS) 
which is the largest collegiate sports injury database in the world (Dick, Agel & Marshall, 2007).  
The ISS uses a representative sample of NCAA institutions to collect injury and exposure data 
through the athletic trainers at the participating institutions, which is its primary goal (Dick et al., 
2007).  The secondary goal of the ISS is to provide information to the institutions for risk 
management decisions (Dick et al., 2007). First developed as a paper-and-pencil system, the ISS 
was converted to a web-based method and is now on its second iteration of an online platform 
(Kerr et al., 2014).  A strength of the ISS are the data quality control measures incorporated into 
the system.  Data pass through a verification process to flag and correct invalid data before it 
reaches the database, specifically to assess exposure counts, injury data and time loss (Kerr et al., 
2014).  As with the CISIR, the NCAA ISS began with football as the sole sport and as of 2005 
had expanded to monitor all NCAA championship and emerging sports, as well as 50 club and 
intramural activities (Dick et al., 2007).  At the high school level, the National High School 
32 
 Sports-Related Injury Surveillance Study uses the High School: Reporting Information Online 
(HS RIO) tool to measure and describe injuries in high school athletes in the United States.  The 
instruments and methods of the HS RIO are based on those of the NCAA ISS (Kerr, Comstock, 
Dompier & Marshall, 2018).  Injury and exposure data from five boys’ and four girls’ sports are 
collected through online reports by affiliated athletic trainers (Rechel, Yard & Comstock, 2008).  
The collection of detailed exposure data allows for the measurement of injury rates in these 
collegiate and high school populations, a useful measure in epidemiological research. 
Data from these various surveillance systems have been reported in the sports injury literature.  
The IRB reported 83.9 injuries per 1000 player match hours and 3.5 injuries per 1000 player-
training hours at the 2007 Rugby World Cup, with lower limb muscle and ligament injuries 
being the most common (Fuller et al., 2008).  At the 2010 Women’s Rugby World Cup, a match 
injury incidence of 35.5/1000 player hours was reported, with knee ligament injuries reported 
most frequently (Taylor, Fuller & Molloy, 2011).  A match injury incidence of 89.1/1000 player 
hours and training injury incidence of 2.2/1000 player hours, again with lower limb 
muscle/tendon/ligament injuries being the most common, was measured at the 2011 IRB Rugby 
World Cup (Fuller, Sheerin & Targett, 2012).  The UEFA football injury study reported an 
incidence of 8.0/1000 player hours from 2001 to 2008 among players from 23 UEFA teams 
(Ekstrand, Hӓgglund & Waldén, 2011).  Similar to findings from rugby, incidence was higher in 
matches than in training, and thigh strain was the most commonly reported injury (Ekstrand et 
al., 2011).  The IOC surveillance system captured a clinical incidence of 111.8 injuries per 1000 
athletes and an injury risk of 11% at the 2010 Olympic Winter Games (Engebretsen et al., 2010) 
and a clinical incidence of 128.8 injuries per 1000 athletes and the same injury risk of 11% at the 
2012 Olympic Summer Games (Engebretsen et al., 2013).  Data from the NCAA ISS have been 
reported in a multitude of publications specific to different sports and injury types.  The overall 
injury rate from the 2009-10 through 2013-14 academic years was estimated to be 6.0 per 1000 
athlete exposures, with sprains and strains being the most commonly reported injury type (Kerr 
et al., 2015).  Similarly, numerous publications report the descriptive epidemiology of injuries at 
the high school level for each specific sport using the HS RIO system.   
Epidemiological studies specific to concussion have also used data from these surveillance 
systems.  An overall incidence of concussion of 12.5/1000 player match hours was reported at 
the 2015 Rugby World Cup (Fuller, Fuller, Kemp & Raftery, 2016).  The UEFA injury study 
33 
 measured a concussion incidence of 0.06/1000 player hours amongst 26 teams from the 2001-02 
through 2009-10 seasons (Nilsson, Hӓgglund, Ekstrand & Waldén, 2013).  Analysis of 25 sports 
in the NCAA found an overall incidence rate of 4.47 per 10,000 athlete-exposures, with the 
highest incidence rates occurring in men’s wrestling, men’s and women’s ice hockey, and 
football (Zuckerman et al., 2015).  A descriptive epidemiology of concussion in 20 sports using 
data from HS RIO reported an overall concussion incidence of 2.5 per 10,000 athlete exposures 
in the 2008-10 academic years (Marar, McIlvain, Fields & Comstock, 2012).   
None of the aforementioned studies included artistic or synchronized swimming.  It has been 
noted that due to variations in injury trends and issues between different populations, it is 
necessary to gather data specific to distinct groups in order to properly characterize injuries and 
implement intervention strategies in those groups (Graitcer, 1987).  Van Mechelen (1997) argues 
that sports injury problems are very sport-specific and many specific etiological factors can be at 
play simultaneously, which suggests the need for a sport-specific surveillance system over a 
general one.  Therefore, due to the possibility in artistic swimming for contact of the type that 
could cause a concussion injury, it is important that sport-specific epidemiological studies be 
conducted. 
 
2.10 Concussion Policy, Resources and Education 
Increase in the awareness of the risk of sustaining a concussion while participating in sports, 
coupled with awareness of the potential seriousness of a concussion injury and the need for 
proper detection and management of concussions, has sparked governments, school boards, and 
sport organizations to design and implement concussion policies and procedures.  While every 
state in the United States had some form of legislation mandating concussion management 
guidelines and education programs in place by 2014, Canada had lagged behind (Hachem, 
Kourits, Mylabathula & Tator, 2016).  Following the death of a young athlete due to 
complications from a sports related concussion injury, the province of Ontario introduced and 
enacted legislation mandating the establishment of an advisory committee to make 
recommendations based on the findings of the coroner’s inquest (Bill 149, 2016).  While this was 
related to sport concussion, it did not include any policy or recommendations for concussion 
prevention or management.  In 2014 the Ontario Ministry of Education implemented a program 
34 
 requiring school boards to introduce concussion management and prevention policies (PPM No. 
158); however, this is not formal legislation (Ontario Ministry of Education, 2014).  An 
investigation into the implementation of these policies in one of the school boards found 
significant gaps in staff training and parent education (Hachem et al., 2016). Subsequently, royal 
assent was given to Rowan’s Law in 2018.  This legislation mandates that all sport organizations 
and schools in Ontario have concussion protocols and mandatory concussion education for their 
members.   
In 2018 the Canadian Olympic and Paralympic Sport Institute (COPSI) Network released the 
Sport-Related Concussion Guidelines for Canadian National and National Development High-
Performance Athletes (COPSI, 2018).  The intention of this document was to guide sport-
concussion management for national sport organizations, national team and national 
development athletes, and provincial sport organizations.  According to the Canadian 
Concussion Collaborative, proper implementation of concussion management and prevention 
policies necessitates user- and context-specific protocols in any event or activity that carries a 
risk of concussion (Fremont, Bradley, Tator, Skinner & Fischer, 2015).  This reinforces the need 
for governing bodies in artistic swimming to develop and implement sport-specific concussion 
safety policies.  In order for these policies to be most effective, scientific investigation of 
concussions in artistic swimming is needed. 
Even when legislation mandates the implementation of safety policies, organizations may not 
always fully comply.  A survey of municipal park and recreation departments in the United 
States found that only one-third were requiring coaches to complete concussion education 
training (Kim, Spengler & Connaughton, 2016).  A survey of NCAA schools revealed that 
stakeholders in the vast majority of the schools felt that their institution’s concussion plan was 
going “well” or “very well”, but that gaps still existed in coach education, sports medicine 
staffing and athlete education (Baugh et al., 2015).  Not only are there gaps in organizational 
compliance and implementation, gaps can also exist in medical professionals’ familiarity with 
concussion legislation.  Carl and Kinsella (2014) surveyed pediatricians and reported strong 
levels of concussion knowledge but most were not familiar with concussion legislation and did 
not use concussion guidelines in their practices.  These findings indicate that not only is there a 
need for sport-specific concussion policies, there will also be a need for knowledge translation 
and implementation plans in order to maximize the effectiveness of safety policies. 
35 
 Many organizations have developed concussion resources and made them publically available.  
In the United States, resources are available from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
(CDC), Concussion Legacy Foundation, American Academy of Neurology, International 
Concussion Society and the Concussion Alliance, to name a few.  Several resources are available 
in Canada as well.  Parachute Canada is a charitable organization dedicated to injury prevention 
that offers online and downloadable resources and a mobile application.  They also offer 
concussion protocol resources for schools, sport organizations and health care professionals.  The 
Ontario Brain Injury Association (OBIA) has an online page with concussion frequently asked 
questions and links to additional resources for children, adults and professionals.  The OBIA also 
sponsors a brain injury/concussion helpline, online concussion support group and brain injury 
peer support group.  Concussions Ontario is a portal is led by the Ontario Neurotrauma 
Foundation, a funding organization for concussion research and improvements to care, that 
provides concussion information and standards for high quality post-concussion care and 
services.  It offers adult and pediatric concussion guidelines and links to other concussion 
organization websites.  The Toronto Acquired Brain Injury (ABI) Network connects brain-
injured patents with hospital and community-based programs, including concussion patients.  
The Toronto ABI Network links to resources for both professionals and individual patients and 
their families.  The Government of Ontario also provides concussion information and links to 
resources on the Rowan’s Law page. 
The plethora of concussion resources available and policy-mandated concussion education 
means that athletes and their coaches are exposed to a large amount of concussion information, 
presumably increasing their knowledge of concussions.  Students’ mean scores on a concussion 
knowledge quiz increased following participation in the Sports Legacy Institute Community 
Educators (SLICE) concussion education curriculum as compared to scores before participation 
(Bagley et al., 2012).  Female gender and age older than 13 were associated with passing the quiz 
after the presentation.  Coaches who used the CDC Heads Up Concussion in High School Sports 
educational toolkit self-reported an increase in their concussion knowledge and a change in their 
attitudes towards concussion to view it as more serious (Sarmiento, Mitchko, Klein & Wong, 
2010).  A survey of youth sport coaches who used the CDC Heads Up toolkit found 77% of 
coaches reported being better able to identify potential concussions in athletes and 50% reported 
that the materials helped them to learn something new (Covassin, Elbin & Sarmiento, 2012).  An 
36 
 evaluation of the effectiveness of the Hockey Concussion Education Project found junior ice 
hockey players that viewed an educational DVD or participated in an interactive computer 
module displayed a positive trend in concussion knowledge, while the players that did not 
participate displayed a negative trend in concussion knowledge (Echlin et al., 2010).  The 
majority of coaches who received two or more modalities of legislated concussion education in 
Washington State were able to answer concussion knowledge questions correctly (Chrisman, 
Schiff, Chung, Herring & Rivara, 2014). 
Whereas many studies have found concussion education resources can help athletes and coaches 
increase their knowledge about concussions, other studies do not support that effect.  A 
prospective cohort study of collegiate ice hockey players found no significant improvement in 
concussion knowledge and only a small decrease in intention to continue playing with a 
concussion following mandated concussion education (Kroshus, Daneshvar, Baugh, Nowinski & 
Cantu, 2014).  Another prospective cohort study reported concussion knowledge scores 
improved immediately following an education intervention but effects disappeared by the end of 
the season (Kurowski, Pomerantz, Schaiper, Ho & Gittelman, 2015).  A comparison of the 
concussion knowledge of collegiate athletes to that of non-athletes showed that despite being 
exposed to formal concussion education, varsity athletes did not have higher levels of concussion 
knowledge than the non-athletes (Knollman-Porter, Brown & Flynn, 2018).  Thus, the actual 
effects of education on concussion knowledge are not clear. 
Differences in the content and delivery of various concussion education programs could be the 
reason for conflicting results of the effects of education.  Kroshus et al. (2014) found variation in 
the content and delivery of concussion education to ice hockey players, and reported that 
receiving concussion information in video form was associated with highest rates of player recall 
of education material while receiving it by email was associated with the lowest rates of recall.  
A qualitative literature review of knowledge transfer in concussion education determined that 
different groups of people participating in concussion education experienced optimal learning 
under different conditions (Provvidenza & Johnston, 2009).  According to that review, 
physicians learn better through education outreach, interaction and reminder messages; athletic 
trainers and physiotherapists through problem- and evidence-based practice, socialization and 
peer-assisted learning; coaches through reflective processes; and athletes through e-learning, 
video games and peer support (Provvidenza & Johnston, 2009).  These findings suggest that 
37 
 knowledge translation is an important consideration when designing concussion education 
initiatives, and how education is delivered may need to be tailored to the audience.  In some 
cases, a variety of educational modalities may need to be employed to ensure everyone is 
reached. 
Even if education is successful in increasing athletes’ or coaches’ concussion knowledge, this 
may not transfer to any changes in attitudes towards concussion or in reporting behaviour.  In a 
retrospective survey, 72% of high school soccer players who received concussion education 
reported that they would always notify their coach if they had symptoms, compared to only 36% 
of players who had not received any concussion education (Bramley, Patrick, Lehman & Silvis, 
2012).  Wallace, Covassin and Beidler (2017) found that female athletes had higher total 
concussion symptom knowledge than male athletes, and male athletes were more likely than 
female athletes to not report concussions for eight out of thirteen reasons.  However, a 
prospective cohort study of NCAA male ice hockey players found that preseason concussion 
knowledge was not associated with in-season reporting behaviour, although intention to report 
concussion symptoms was significantly related to reporting (Kroshus, Baugh, Daneshvar, 
Nowinski & Cantu, 2015).  Register-Mihalik et al. (2013) found that higher levels of concussion 
knowledge were associated with increased concussion reporting in practices but not games, and 
more favourable attitude towards reporting was associated with decreased reports of sport 
participation while symptomatic in high school athletes.  An examination of the effect of coach 
concussion education on athlete reporting found that most modes of coach education were not 
associated with increased awareness of their athletes’ concussions, and coaches who used video 
and quiz education modalities were actually less likely to be aware of their athletes’ concussions 
(Rivara et al., 2014).  The equivocal findings in terms of the connection between concussion 
knowledge and reporting indicates that knowledge alone is not a sufficient predictor of whether 
or not an athlete will report a concussion. 
If concussion knowledge is not a reliable predictor of reporting, what does predict it?  
Experiencing a previous concussion does not appear to improve reporting.  A cross-sectional 
survey of high school athletes from multiple sports found a larger number of previous 
concussions was associated with a worse attitude towards concussion and with negative 
concussion disclosure behaviour (Register-Mihalik, Valovich McLeod, Linnan, Guskiewicz & 
Marshall, 2017).  Athlete sex appears to be related to concussion disclosure, with higher rates of 
38 
 concussion reporting described in female athletes than in male athletes (Kerr, Register-Mihalik, 
Kroshus, Baugh & Marshall, 2016; Wallace et al., 2017).  The most common reasons for an 
athlete not disclosing a concussion reported in the literature include: not wanting to be removed 
from the game or practice, not wanting to let their coaches or team mates down, and not thinking 
their concussion was serious (Fraas, Coughlan, Hart & McCarthy, 2014; Kerr et al., 2016; 
LaRoche, Nelson, Connelly, Walter & McCrea, 2016; McCrea, Hammeke, Olsen, Leo & 
Guskiewicz, 2004; Register-Mihalik et al., 2013). 
Some researchers have attempted to describe or predict concussion reporting using existing 
psychological theories.  Kerr et al. (2014) used the socio-ecological framework (Stokol, 1992) to 
summarize and organize factors related to disclosure of concussion.  According to their 
categorization, the most commonly reported reasons for not disclosing a concussion in the 
included studies were factors from the intrapersonal level (Kerr et al., 2014).  In an application of 
the Theory of Planned Behaviour to the prediction of concussion symptom reporting, intention to 
report symptoms was significantly associated with reporting behaviour, subjective norms and 
self-efficacy were significantly associated with both intention and behaviour, and attitude about 
perceived reporting outcomes was significantly associated with intention but not behaviour 
(Kroshus, Baugh, Daneshvar & Viswanath, 2014).  These studies suggest that it may be useful to 
consider existing theories and models in the explanation of concussion reporting behaviour. 
Despite the link between concussion resources, education and reporting remaining unclear, the 
effects of concussion resources and education appear to be positive.  Research suggests sport-
specificity and variety in education modalities are important.  Findings indicate that concussion 
resources should be sport-specific to be most effective, which underlines the importance of 
developing concussion resources specific to artistic swimming.  In addition, studies suggest that 
a variety of education modalities are needed to maximize the effectiveness of concussion 
education.  This indicates that to be of optimal use to the artistic swimming community, multiple 
resources should be employed.

 2.11 Review of Literature Summary 
There are relatively few published studies examining artistic/synchronized swimming.  Findings 
indicate that performing a competitive routine places high physical demand on these athletes, and 
that certain physiological characteristics such as isokinetic strength of certain joints and muscular 
and aerobic power may be related to performance outcomes.  The limited reports of injuries in 
artistic/synchronized swimming demonstrate a research focus on chronic overuse injuries, with 
the suggested potential for acute traumatic injuries such as sport-related concussion.   
Sport-related concussion is a brain injury which causes disturbances to neurological function and 
results in a constellation of clinical signs and symptoms in physical, cognitive, somatic, and 
sleep domains.  While concussion is not detectable using traditional imaging technologies, there 
is a complex neurobiological cascade affecting the brain’s metabolism that appears to underpin 
the effects of a concussion.  Changes to psychological factors like mood and autonomic nervous 
system disruption have been reported.  Lasting neurological or psychological effects are still 
being characterized, and taken together the current knowledge of concussion indicates that these 
injuries should be taken seriously and the risk mitigated where possible.  An important aspect of 
sport-related concussion prevention strategies is the monitoring of the number of concussions in 
the population of interest through injury surveillance.  The implementation of organizational and 
sport-specific concussion policies will also play a role in protecting artistic swimmers from 
concussion injuries during participation in their sport.

Research Overview 
 
 Overview of Research Program  
3.1 Purpose, Objectives and Hypotheses  
This research had two purposes: (1) to investigate the number and nature of concussions among 
youth artistic swimmers in Ontario, and (2) to investigate concussion and develop sport-specific 
concussion resources through collaboration with the community.  The research objectives were 
as follows: (1) to determine the single-season incidence of concussions among youth (less than 
18 years of age) Ontario artistic swimmers, (2) to determine the seasonal training phase in which 
concussions are most frequent, (3) to determine the competitive age group in which concussions 
are most common, (4) to describe which injury context factors are more frequently present in a 
concussion sustained during artistic swimming participation, and (5) to develop sport-specific 
concussion resources for artistic swimming through collaboration with the provincial sport 
organization.   
Three hypotheses were tested: (1) Concussions would be more frequent during the specific 
preparatory phase of the training season than in the general preparation phase, general 
competition phase or specific competition phase, (2) Concussions would be more frequent in the 
13-15 age group than in the 11-12 age group or the Junior/16-20 age group, and (3) Contact with 
another athlete during highlights would be the more frequent mechanism of injury than contact 
with a surface or non-contact trauma during pattern transitions, swimming warm-up, or dryland 
training.  It was hypothesized that concussions would be more frequent in the specific 
preparation phase because this is a period of intense training before the competitions begin.  It 
was expected that more concussions would occur during training because of the aesthetic nature 
of the sport.  Other aesthetic sports, for example cheerleading, have found higher numbers of 
concussions in training compared to competition (Marar et al., 2012; Schulz et al., 2004; Shields 
& Smith, 2009).  More concussions were expected in the 13-15 age group as compared to other 
competitive age groups because the demands in terms of skills and training dramatically increase 
between the 11-12 age group and the 13-15 age group, which could lead to a “mismatch” 
41 
 between an athlete’s ability and the training demands.  It was suspected that highlights and 
pattern transitions would be the activities most frequently associated with sustaining a 
concussion because these are relatively high risk compared to other artistic swimming maneuvers 
due to the movement of the athletes relative to one another.    
The research consisted of three studies.  A retrospective cross-sectional survey study (Study 
One) was the preliminary step to determine whether artistic swimmers had sustained concussions 
as a direct result of their participation in the sport, and to begin to elucidate the injury contexts 
surrounding these concussions.  Study One addressed research objectives 2, 3 and 4, and their 
associated hypotheses.  Objective 2 was to determine the seasonal training phase in which 
concussions were more likely to occur, and it was hypothesized that concussions would be more 
frequent in the specific preparatory phase.  Objective 3 was to determine the competitive age 
group in which concussions were most frequent, and it was hypothesized that concussions would 
be most common in the 13-15 age group.  Objective 4 was to describe which injury context 
factors are more frequently present in a concussion sustained during artistic swimming 
participation, and it was hypothesized that highlights and pattern changes would be the artistic 
swimming activities most frequently leading to a concussion.   
Following the retrospective study, a prospective cohort study (Study Two) was conducted to 
measure the incidence of concussion in Ontario artistic swimmers over a competitive season, and 
to continue to describe the concussion injury contexts.  Study Two addressed research objectives 
1 through 4.  Objective 1 was to determine the single-season incidence of concussions among 
youth (less than 18 years of age) Ontario artistic swimmers.  There was no hypothesis associated 
with this objective because to my knowledge concussions have never been measured in artistic 
swimmers before.  Objectives 2-4 and their associated hypotheses are described above. 
Concurrent to these studies, a suite of sport-specific concussion resources for artistic swimming 
were developed in collaboration with the provincial sport organization, Synchro Swim Ontario 
(SSO).  The development of these resources addressed Objective 5.  Study Three describes the 
development of these resources through the collaboration between the academic researcher and 
community organization.  The purpose of Study Three was to describe the collaborative process 
between the university-based principal investigator and the community-based sport organization, 
Synchro Swim Ontario, in the development and implementation of the concussion safety 
42 
 program, and to evaluate said program.  This program is a collection of sport-specific concussion 
resources compiled to assist the athletes, coaches and officials of artistic swimming in Ontario in 
recognizing and managing concussions sustained during participation in artistic swimming, and 
addressed the fifth research objective: to develop sport-specific concussion resources for the 
Ontario artistic swimming community.   
It is important to the success of similar programs of research, and resources, to characterize the 
successful aspects of the collaboration between the two parties, as well as the difficulties 
experienced in the process.  It is equally important to evaluate the content and delivery of the 
concussion safety program in order to maximize the effectiveness and utility of the program to 
the members.  A summary and analysis of the collaboration can be found in Chapter 6. 
An important part of the concussion safety program was the implementation of an injury tracking 
program, which relied on an online injury tracking tool to collect data on all injuries sustained by 
Ontario artistic swimmers, including concussions.  In order to evaluate the injury tracker and 
identify ways in which it could be improved, a qualitative study examining coaches’ perceptions 
of the tracker was performed (Study Four).  This study is presented in Chapter 7. 
The specific details of the research methods for each of the four studies can be found in the 
following chapters.  Each study is presented in its own chapter encompassing rationale, methods, 
results and discussion. 
 
3.2 Definition of Sport-Specific Terms 
Seasonal Training Phase: A macrocycle of the Yearly Training Plan (YTP) used by Canadian 
artistic swimming coaches for periodization of training.  The YTP for club-level athletes taught 
in the Canadian artistic swimming coach education programs consists of four phases: general 
preparation (September-October), specific preparation (November-December), general 
competition (January-March) and specific competition (April-June).  This YTP is based on the 
main championship meet of the season occurring in May/June and off-season of July-August. 
Competitive Stream: The competitive pathway that an athlete is following for the season.  In 
Ontario, there are three streams: Novice, Provincial, and National, or FINA.  Novice athletes 
43 
 compete locally and have the fewest practices and competitions, Provincial level athletes 
compete within the province and have an intermediate number of practices and competitions, and 
National stream athletes compete out of the province against other Canadian club teams and have 
the most practices and competitions. 
Competitive Age Group: The competitive structure used in Ontario (and Canada) is aligned 
with that used by FINA in FINA-sanctioned meets.  Athletes compete in categories called 
competitive age groups that are determined by age.  These categories are consistent across the 
competitive streams and are as follows: 10 & Under, 11-12, 13-15, Junior (16-18), and Senior 
(18+).   
Routine: Artistic swimmers compete in various routine events.  A solo routine is comprised of 
one athlete, a duet routine of two, a team of four to eight, and a combo of four to ten.  Routines 
have set time limits that vary by age category.  In Junior and Senior, athletes compete in 
Technical and Free events.  Technical routines must contain a set of required skill elements that 
must be performed in a particular order.  Athletes in the 13-15 and younger age categories 
compete in a Figures event in place of a technical routine. 
Choreography: The sequence of movements that make up a routine. 
Highlight: A risky maneuver in which one or more athletes is propelled out of the water by their 
team mates. 
Pattern Transition: The movement of artistic swimmers from one ‘pattern’ or formation to 
another.  Typically happens quickly and requires a high degree of precision so athletes do not 
collide.

Study One 
 
 Concussions in Youth Artistic Swimmers: A 
Retrospective Descriptive Study  
 
4.1 Abstract 
Objective: To describe and characterize the situational factors of concussions sustained by a 
sample of female youth competitive artistic swimmers. 
Design:  Retrospective, cross-sectional study. 
Setting:  Current and former Ontario club-level artistic swimmers who completed an online 
survey about the circumstances surrounding their concussions. 
Participants:  A convenience sample of 230 female artistic swimmers was screened.  Fifty 
swimmers (21.7%) reported sustaining concussions between the ages of 11-18 years. 
Independent Variables:  Eight variables (age, mechanism of injury, specific activity at time of 
injury, diagnosing individual, time lost due to injury, location, activity type, and seasonal 
training phase) were examined. 
Outcome Measures:  Analyses included descriptive statistics and chi square goodness-of-fit 
tests. 
Results:   69 concussions from 50 artistic swimmers were analyzed.  15 swimmers reported 
sustaining two concussions, and two swimmers reported sustaining three.  The mean age of 
occurrence was 13.93 (±1.97) years.  The most commonly reported mechanism of injury was 
athlete-athlete contact (81.2%) and performing highlights (37.7%).  Family doctors were the 
medical practitioners most commonly diagnosing concussions (39.1%).  The most commonly 
reported time loss due to injury was more than 4 weeks (34.8%).   Concussions occurred most 
commonly in pool training (94.2%), in the deep-end of the pool (78.3%), and in the specific 
45 
 preparation and general competition training phases (68.1% combined). Chi square tests were 
significant for all variables (p<0.05). 
Conclusions:  This study is the first to examine concussions in the under-studied sport of artistic 
swimming.  Concussions occur most frequently from swimmer-to-swimmer contact, and often 
result in a greater than 4 week time loss from the sport.  Further epidemiological research is 
warranted. 
 
4.2 Introduction 
Females are underrepresented in sport-related concussion (SRC) research (McKeever & Schatz, 
2003; Resch, Rach, Walton & Broshek, 2017) despite findings that indicate the incidence of 
concussion is higher in female athletes (Dick, 2009).  Higher concussion incidence rates have 
been reported in female compared to male athletes in both collegiate (Kerr et al., 2017) and high 
school sports (Gessel, Fields, Collins, Dick & Comstock, 2007).  In one epidemiological study of 
concussions in 27 high school sports, there was an overall incidence rate equivalent to 0.26 per 
1000 athlete exposures in females (O’Connor et al., 2017).  Similarly, incidence rates between 
0.17 and 0.73 concussions per 1000 athlete exposures have been reported in female high school 
soccer, volleyball, basketball and softball players (Rosenthal, Foraker, Collins & Comstock, 
2014).  Females tend to comprise the majority of the membership in aesthetic sports, in which 
there is also a paucity of research. To date, there are no concussion studies specific to artistic 
swimming.  It is important to study concussions in this population in order to assist in concussion 
prevention in these athletes, as well as to increase our knowledge of concussions in female 
aesthetic sports. 
Artistic swimming (AS), formerly called synchronized swimming, is an aesthetic sport in which 
athletes (mostly females) compete against one another with routines set to music.  The sport, 
originally called ornamental swimming or scientific swimming, was developed from theatrical 
water ballet performances to include elements from lifesaving techniques and swimming, 
evolving into a very physically demanding full-contact sport (Federation Internationale de 
Natation, 2015).  Since the Olympic debut of synchronized swimming in 1984 in which only 
three countries participated (FINA, 2015), the sport has grown to be practiced by many countries 
46 
 on 6 continents. At the most recent World Aquatic Championships, athletes from over 40 
countries competed in AS (FINA, 2017). 
In the last 20 years AS has evolved dramatically: faster routine choreography, tighter pattern 
formations, and higher and more powerful aerial acrobatic moves.  Consequently, the chance of 
incidental contact between the athletes has increased, and likely, the risk of injury.  Recently, the 
province of Ontario has mandated all provincial sport organizations implement concussion 
policies with the enactment of Rowan’s Law (2018).   Despite these initiatives, there is no sport-
specific empirical evidence to inform the content of these policies.  
One of the few studies examining injuries in AS reported an injury rate of 28 injuries in 990 
athlete exposures at the 2009 Federation Internationale de Natation (FINA) World Aquatic 
Championships (Mountjoy et al., 2010).  Dental trauma in artistic swimmers has also been 
reported, which indicates head and face impacts of sufficient intensity to injure teeth are 
occurring; therefore, it is possible that this amount of force is enough to cause a SRC (Andrade et 
al., 2010).   The American Academy of Pediatrics (2001) defines contact sports as those in which 
athletes routinely make contact with one another but with less force than in collision sports.  
According to this definition, AS could be classified as a contact sport.  Mountjoy, the former 
team physician for Canada Artistic Swimming (formerly Synchro Canada), was the first to 
describe the potential for acute traumatic injuries due to contact between synchronized (artistic) 
swimmers (Mountjoy, 1999; Mountjoy, 2009).  Furthermore, she has suggested that the heavy 
training requirements and rigorous work ethic of elite synchronized (artistic) swimmers 
challenge compliance with concussion management guidelines, indicating a need for education 
and close follow-up (Mountjoy, 2009).   
Given the nature of the sport and this call to action by Mountjoy (2009), investigation into the 
scope and nature of SRCs in AS is critical going forward.  Sport-specific epidemiological data on 
concussions would inform future concussion guidelines and safety policies.  Understanding the 
contexts surrounding concussions in AS would help to determine how to manage risks associated 
with concussions in this sport, thereby informing prevention.  
Thus, the purpose of this study was to describe and characterize the nature and contexts of SRCs 
sustained by female youth artistic swimmers in Ontario, Canada.  The objectives were: (1) to 
determine the seasonal training phase in which concussions were more likely to occur, (2) to 
47 
 determine the competitive age group in which concussions are most common, and (3) describe 
which injury context factors are more frequently present in a concussion sustained during artistic 
swimming participation.  We hypothesized that concussions would be more frequent in the 
specific preparation phase than in the general preparation phase, general competition phase or 
specific competition phase.  We hypothesized that concussions would be more frequent in the 
13-15 age group than in the 11-12 age group or the Junior/16-20 age group.  We hypothesized 
that contact with another athlete during highlights would be the more frequent mechanism of 
injury than contact with a surface or non-contact trauma during pattern transitions, swimming 
warm-up, or dryland training.  We believe the results elucidate the contexts leading to SRC in 
AS and provide a base for future research. 
 
4.3 Method 
4.3.1 Participants 
This study was approved by the Research Ethics Board at the University of Toronto (Protocol 
#34507).  A link to participate in the study was sent by Synchro Swim Ontario (SSO), the 
provincial sport governing body in Ontario, to all of the member clubs, with a request that it be 
forwarded to their memberships.  All members were invited to participate.  In addition, 
participation invitations were posted to SSO’s social media (Facebook and Instagram) pages.  
Inclusion criteria were current or former Ontario artistic swimmers, between the ages of 11 and 
18. Athletes needed to be registered in a competitive AS category, and had experienced a SRC 
between September 2012 and September 2017.  The email invitation would have reached 
approximately 1260 members (the number of registered novice and competitive athletes with 
SSO in the 2017-2018 competitive season), of which 741 would have been within the age range 
and competitive level to be included in the study.  It is unknown how many respondents were 
reached through the social media postings; however, SSO had 2912 followers on Facebook and 
1688 followers on Instagram at the time the study invitation was posted.  Participants gave 
informed consent prior to participating.  A copy of the consent form is included in Appendix A. 
48 
 4.3.2 Materials 
The data collection instrument was developed by the first author, in collaboration with SSO 
board members and administrators (Appendix B).  Wording and order of the questions were 
based on that of the PlaySafe Injury Tracker (Sunnybrook Office for Injury Prevention, 2017), 
developed as an accessible online tool for Canadian sport organizations to track injuries in their 
membership.  The content of the injury tracker is based on the injury surveillance form used by 
the International Olympic Committee (IOC) (Junge et al., 2008).  The IOC surveillance form was 
piloted at the 2004 Athens games and fully adopted for the 2008 Beijing games, and was itself 
based on questions used in soccer (Junge et al., 2008).  The PlaySafe tracker used the questions 
from the IOC form and adapted them to be more applicable in a community setting, guided by 
the principles of the Translating Research into Injury Prevention Practice (TRIPP) framework 
(Finch, 2006).  The PlaySafe tracker is customizable and was tailored to be specific to Ontario 
artistic swimming by the principal investigator and members of SSO.  The survey was reviewed 
for face and content validity during the customization process.   
The data were collected and managed using digital tools from REDCap (Research Electronic 
Data Capture), hosted at the University of Toronto.  REDCap is a secure, web-based digital 
project management application that allows investigators to build data collection instruments, 
electronically capture data, and organize and manage data easily (Harris et al., 2009). 
4.3.3 Measures 
The data were organized by one continuous variable (age), and seven categorical variables 
(mechanism of injury, specific activity at time of injury, diagnosing individual, time lost due to 
injury, activity type, location, and seasonal training phase).  The seasonal training phase was 
determined for each concussion from the reported date of injury.  All possible categories for each 
variable can be viewed in Table 1. 
4.3.4 Procedure 
Participants completed an online questionnaire.  If a participant indicated that they had sustained 
any concussions due to synchronized swimming, they were asked several questions about the 
circumstances surrounding their injuries.  Participants were instructed to respond to the questions 
for each concussion.  For athletes aged 15 years and younger, consent was obtained from their 
49 
 parent/guardian, and the parent/guardian was asked to complete the survey for their child.  
Athletes aged 16 years and older gave their own consent and were asked to complete the survey 
themselves.  The data were exported into Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Office Professional Plus 
2016, Version 16.0.4738.1000) with any identifying information removed. 
4.3.5 Analysis 
Descriptive statistics were calculated for all variables.  Chi square goodness-of-fit tests were 
calculated for all categorical variables.  This test is used to determine if the observed distribution 
of a categorical variable is the same or different than an expected distribution (Cressie & Read, 
1984).  In this case the observed distribution was compared to an expected equal distribution 
among cells, as would occur by chance.  This was done to ensure any differences between the 
observed frequencies in the categories of each variable were statistically significant. Significance 
was set at α=.05.  Statistical analyses were conducted with IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows 
(IBM Corp, Version 24). 
 
4.4 Results 
4.4.1 Descriptive Statistics 
Of the 263 respondents, 262 (99.6%) consented to participate. Incomplete responses (n=32) were 
removed from the data set.  Of the remaining 230 respondents, 106 (46%) reported that they had 
sustained a diagnosed concussion directly due to synchronized swimming.  Of those participants, 
79 completed the entire survey, reporting 107 concussions.  Thirty-three of those concussions 
occurred when participants were either younger than 11 or older than 18, and an additional 5 
were sustained when respondents were not registered in the competitive category.  These 
incidents were excluded from analysis, leaving 69 concussions reported by 50 athletes eligible 
for the study (Figure 1).

 contact with another athlete (81.2%), and performing highlights (37.7%) and pattern transitions 
(30.4%) were the most frequently reported specific activities at time of injury.  Family doctors 
typically diagnosed concussions (39.1%), followed by sport medicine specialists (30.4%).   Time 
lost due to injury was most frequently reported at more than four weeks (34.8%).  Concussions 
occurred almost exclusively during in-pool training (94.2%), and occurred most frequently in the 
deep-end of the pool (78.3%).  Concussions most frequently occurred in the specific preparation 
(33.3%) and general competition (34.8%) training phases, which span from November to March.

Chi-square goodness-of-fit tests were significant (p<0.05) for all categorical variables (Table 2).  
Concussions were significantly more common (p<0.05) in the specific preparation and general 
competition phases than in the general preparation and specific competition phases.  Contact 
with another athlete was significantly more frequent (p<0.01) as the mechanism of injury than 
contact with an object, non-contact trauma, and other.  Concussions occurred significantly more 
frequently (p<0.01) during pattern transitions and highlights than in warm-up, dry-land training, 
or choreography.  In-pool training had significantly more concussions occur (p<0.01) than dry-
land training, competition event or competition warm-up.  Concussions were significantly more 
common (p<0.01) in deep water than in the shallow-end of the pool, on the pool deck, or in a 
dryland training area.  Finally, athletes missed more than four weeks of artistic swimming 
participation significantly more often (p<0.05) than less than a week, one to two weeks, or three 
to four weeks.

 4.5 Discussion 
To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine sport-specific concussion factors in artistic 
swimmers.  It is an important starting point for further examination of concussion rates and 
factors in this sport.  AS is commonly thought of as a non-contact sport; therefore, it is not given 
the same attention and study as more traditional contact sports.  There is a large amount of 
athlete-to-athlete contact during the execution of routines in AS; hence, there is a potential for 
injuries (Mountjoy, 2009).   In order to begin to reduce the risk of concussions in AS, it is 
important to describe the associated factors. 
4.5.1 Injury Factors 
The most common mechanism of injury was athlete-to-athlete contact (81.2%) during the 
execution of highlights (37.7%).  Highlights are the powerful throws, stands, and flips executed 
by the team forming a base under the water and propelling one or two athletes up out of the 
water with force.  These are considered to be very “high risk” moves and typically only occur a 
handful of times within a routine.  However, the chance for contact between the athletes is 
increased as a failed highlight may fall on a team member, or collisions may occur under the 
water while the team is swimming into or out of the base positions. A similar pattern is seen in 
cheerleading, where it has been reported that “stunts” are responsible for 60% of all injuries and 
96% of concussions and closed head injuries (Shields, Fernandez & Smith, 2009). 
Concussions were more frequently diagnosed by a family doctor (39.1%).  Primary care 
providers may not have training in the diagnosis and management of concussions (Zonfrillo et 
al., 2012), and the findings suggest that injured artistic swimmers are attending general 
practitioners more often than emergency physicians or sports medicine specialists.  The most 
frequently reported time loss due to injury was more than four weeks (34.8%).  The 2017 
Concussion in Sport Group consensus statement indicates the expected duration of symptoms is 
up to 4 weeks in children (McCrory et al., 2017), indicating the athletes from this study are 
taking longer than expected to recover.  Evidence suggests that female athletes take longer to 
recover from concussion than their male counterparts (Stone, Lee, Garrison, Blueitt & Creed, 
2016).  This is one possible explanation for why the athletes in this study lost more than four 
weeks to injury: The sample was solely comprised of female adolescents.  In addition, the fact 
that family doctors diagnosed 39% of concussions may have had some influence on the longer 
54 
 time to recover.  A family doctor may not have the same level of concussion management 
training as a sports medicine specialist, and may prescribe longer rest, as has been the traditional 
standard in concussion management (Silverberg & Iverson, 2013). 
Concussions occurred almost exclusively during in-pool training (94.2%), contrary to findings 
from most other sports that incidence rates of SRCs are higher in games than in practices 
(Dompier et al., 2015; Gessel et al., 2007; O’Connor et al., 2017).  Artistic swimmers train their 
routine numerous times prior to competition.  Once in competition, the routine has been 
rehearsed well enough to avoid mistakes that might lead to highlights failing, collisions under the 
water, and other unplanned contact between athletes.  Again, this is similar to findings from 
competitive cheerleading, in which it has been reported that 85% of injuries sustained by US 
cheerleaders during a one year period happened during training (Shields & Smith, 2009).  
Concussions were more likely to occur in deep water (78.3%), likely because most AS training 
takes place in deep rather than shallow water.  Further, concussions were more common during 
the specific preparation (33.3%) and general competition (34.8%) seasonal phases.  These 
seasonal phases tend to have the highest training volume along with lower levels of proficiency, 
which could lead to errors resulting in injury. 
4.5.2 Limitations 
There are a number of limitations associated with this research.  First, the study was 
retrospective and thus participants’ answers were subject to recall bias.  Only concussions from 
within the last five years were included, in an effort to balance accuracy of recall and 
representativeness of the sample (Fadnes, Taube & Tylleskӓr, 2009).  Second, the study uses 
self-report, which may lead to social desirability bias.  This is when a desire to appear in a 
positive light influences one’s answers on a survey or questionnaire, which in turn can confound 
observed relationships in the results (Ganster, Hennessey & Luthens, 1983).  Third, the title of 
the survey instrument, “Past Concussions in Ontario Synchronized Swimmers”, may have 
contributed to a sample bias in that those who participated were those who felt the survey was 
relevant to them.  Even though all members were invited to participate, regardless of whether 
they had sustained a concussion or not, it is probable that people were more likely to respond if 
they had been concussed.  Consequently, this limits the interpretation of the results.  Addressing 
55 
 these methodological limitations (e.g. prospective method, data collection without self-report, 
non-volunteer sample) would be beneficial in future research. 
 
4.6 Conclusion and Clinical Implications 
Findings of this preliminary work elucidate the context in which concussions are occurring in 
artistic swimming.  Contact with other athletes during highlights was identified as the main 
mechanism of injury.  Future prospective research with more diverse data collection methods 
would help to clarify the picture of concussions in this sport.  Future research can inform safety 
guidelines, prevention policies, and clinical management.  Clinicians working with artistic 
swimmers should be aware that contact between athletes is a primary mechanism of injury.  The 
findings emphasize the importance of family physicians as a frontline in the management of 
concussion in these young athletes.

 Incidence of Concussion in Youth Artistic Swimmers in 
Ontario: A Prospective Study  
 
5.1 Abstract 
Objective : To measure the incidence of concussion in youth artistic swimmers in a competitive 
season and describe the contexts in which these concussions occurred. 
Design: Prospective cohort study. 
Setting: Club-level competitive artistic swimmers in Ontario who participated in the 2017-2018 
competitive season. 
Participants : Competitive artistic swimmers registered in the national, provincial, or novice 
categories in Ontario in the 2017-2018 competitive season. 
Independent Variables : Seven variables (age, mechanism of injury, competitive category, 
specific activity at time of injury, location, activity type, and seasonal training phase) were 
examined.   
Outcome Measures : Incidence proportion (risk) and clinical incidence of concussions were 
calculated.  Mechanism of injury and activity at the time of injury were described. 
Results:  The mean age of concussed athletes was 12.80 (±2.53) years.  Twenty-two concussions 
occurred during the season, for a clinical incidence of 0.02.  The risk of sustaining a concussion 
was 1.91%.  Contact with another athlete was the most frequently reported mechanism of injury 
(72.7%) and pattern transitions were the most frequently reported activity at the time of 
concussion (31.8%). 
Conclusions : This study is the first to measure the incidence of concussion in artistic swimmers 
and the first to prospectively examine injuries over a competitive artistic swimming season.  It is 
57 
 an important starting point for sport-specific concussion tracking and prevention.  More 
comprehensive study of concussions in artistic swimmers is warranted. 
 
5.2 Introduction 
Despite its origins in theatrical performance, artistic swimming (AS)—formerly synchronized 
swimming—has evolved into a contact sport with high physical demands (FINA, 2015).  A 
recent retrospective study of concussions in artistic swimming suggested the most frequent 
mechanism of injury is contact between athletes during highlights (dynamic acrobatic maneuvers 
involving lifting or throwing team members up out of the water).  Furthermore, concussions 
typically resulted in more than 4 weeks’ time lost from the sport (McClemont & Mainwaring, 
unpublished).  These findings indicate that there is a risk of athlete contact resulting in 
concussions in artistic swimming, and further investigation is warranted to explore the scope of 
the problem and any risk factors for concussions in the sport.  Mountjoy (2009) was the first to 
report the risk of traumatic injuries including concussion from contact between athletes in AS. 
Females and aesthetic sports are underrepresented in concussion research.  Compared to males, 
females have higher concussion rates at both the high school and collegiate levels (Gessel et al., 
2007; Kerr et al., 2017).  Females have a higher symptom burden following a concussion and 
may take longer to recover than males (Broshek et al., 2005; Chiang Colvin et al., 2009).  In 
cheerleading concussion rates have been measured in youth, high school and collegiate levels 
(Shields, Fernandez & Smith, 2009).  There are a handful of studies describing concussions in 
dance (Kish & Koutures, 2016; Roberts, Nelson & McKenzie, 2013; Stein et al., 2014), and one 
study reporting on concussion in theater personnel (Russell & Daniell, 2018).  Studying 
concussion in artistic swimmers would be an important step in addressing this gap in our 
knowledge of sport-related concussions in female athletes.   
AS represents an unstudied female population with respect to sport concussion.  Incidence data 
on concussions in AS would inform concussion management guidelines and sport-specific safety 
policies.  The main purpose of this study was to examine the incidence of concussions in youth 
competitive artistic swimmers in Ontario over the 2017-2018 season. The secondary purpose was 
to describe the situational factors associated with concussions in this cohort.  To our knowledge 
58 
 this is the first study to measure the incidence of concussion in artistic swimming and the first 
study to prospectively describe the situational factors associated with concussion in artistic 
swimmers.   
 
5.3 Method 
5.3.1 Study Design and Participants 
This prospective cohort study was approved by the University of Toronto Research Ethics Board 
(Protocol #34507).  The data were collected using the injury tracking system used by Synchro 
Swim Ontario (SSO), developed by the PlaySafe Initiative (Sunnybrook Office of Injury 
Prevention).  SSO is the provincial governing body of AS in Ontario and requires that any and all 
injuries sustained by its members during any SSO-sanctioned event (practices, competitions, 
training camps, etc.) be reported to the organization through this system. 
The principal investigator received the injury reports from SSO with all names removed.  There 
were 123 injury reports filed over the 2017-2018 competitive season.  Reported injuries 
sustained by athletes not in a competitive stream (n=17) and by competitive athletes outside the 
included age range (n=1) were removed, leaving a sample of 105 injuries.  Inclusion criteria 
were: registered athlete with SSO, competing in national, provincial, or novice stream, 17 years 
of age or younger, and injury was sustained directly from participation in artistic swimming.  
The participant flowchart is displayed in Figure 2. 
59 
  
Figure 2. Participant flowchart (prospective study). 
5.3.2 Materials and Procedure 
The data were collected with the PlaySafe Injury Tracker (Sunnybrook Office for Injury 
Prevention, 2017), a web-based survey application free to use for sport organizations for injury 
surveillance.  In collaboration with SSO board members and administrators, the principal 
investigator developed questions specific to AS to include in the survey.  This customized 
version of the tracker was reviewed for face and content validity.  The injury tracker form can be 
found in Appendix C. 
A link to the Injury Tracker was available on the SSO website.  Coaches were directed to 
complete a report as soon as possible after any injury that resulted in disruption and/or 
modification of an athlete’s training.  Completed injury reports were received and compiled by 
the SSO Sport Development Manager.  Any reports indicating a blow to the head or face were

 flagged as a possible concussion.  The SSO Sport Development Manager performed six week 
follow-ups with the coach filing the report for all flagged head impacts.  Concussion status was 
recorded in the report after the follow-up. 
5.3.3 Study Variables and Definitions 
Three variables were extracted from the injury tracker and examined: AS age at time of injury, 
mechanism of injury and the specific artistic swimming activity at the time of injury.  
AS age at time of injury was defined as age on December 31, 2018 and was determined from the 
athlete’s date of birth.  Mechanism of injury was categorized by five possibilities: contact with 
another athlete, contact with a stationary object, non-contact trauma, overuse, or other. Specific 
activity at time of injury was categorized by six possibilities: 1) pattern transitions, 2) highlights, 
3) choreography, 4) swimming laps, 5) dryland, or 6) other.  Concussion diagnosis was 
categorized into Yes (concussion) or No (musculoskeletal injury).  Concussions were only 
considered to be a “Yes” if they had been diagnosed by a medical doctor. 
5.3.4 Analysis  
Descriptive statistics were calculated for all variables.   
The incidence proportion (risk) and clinical incidence of diagnosed concussions were calculated.  
Concussion risk was calculated using the following formula: 
 Concussion Risk = ఀ஼௢௡௖௨௦௦௘ௗ  ஺௧௛௟௘௧௘௦
ఀ஺௧௛௟௘௧௘௦ , ΣAthletes=number of eligible registered athletes

Statistical analyses were conducted with IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows (IBM Corp, Version 
24), with significance set at α=0.05.

 5.4 Results 
5.4.1 Descriptive Statistics 
There were a total of 105 injury reports filed for athletes meeting the inclusion criteria (n=1151).  
Of those, 62 (59%) were flagged as potential concussions, with 22 (21%) diagnosed concussions, 
27 (25.7%) classified as musculoskeletal injuries, and 13 incomplete follow-ups. The athletes 
lost to follow-up were excluded from the analysis.  The mean age of concussed athletes was 
12.80 (±2.53) years, with a range of 9-17, and was not significantly different from the mean age 
of musculo-skeletal injured athletes (12.41 ± 2.57 years). The most frequent mechanism of injury 
of concussions was contact with another athlete (72.7%).  Concussions occurred most frequently 
in the specific preparation and general competition (36.4% each) seasonal phases.  Pattern 
transition (31.8%) was the most commonly reported activity at the time of injury.  All but one 
concussion happened during training (95.5%), and the majority were sustained in the deep-end of 
the pool (90.9%).  The majority of concussions (72.7%) were reported by athletes competing in 
the Provincial stream.  Concussions represented 21% of all injury reports.  Demographic 
characteristics of the concussed athletes are reported in Table 3.

 5.5 Discussion 
5.5.1 Incidence and Situational Factors 
To our knowledge, this study is the first epidemiological study of concussions in artistic 
swimming.  Concussions represented 21% of all reported injuries, which is higher than reports 
from other sports.  Two epidemiological studies of sport-related injuries in male and female 
athletes in 100 US high schools reported only 8.9% (Gessel et al., 2007) and 9.1% (Rechel, Yard 
& Comstock, 2008) of injuries were concussions.  Schulz and colleagues (2004) reported 7.49% 
of injuries sustained by high school athletes were concussions, while Meehan, d’Hemecourt, 
Collins and Comstock (2011) reported that concussions represented 14.6% of the injuries in a 
sample of US high school athletes.  The higher proportion of concussions observed in this study 
could be due to a coach being more likely to sit an athlete out and file a report for a possible 
concussion than for a chronic overuse injury.   
The single-season concussion risk was 1.91%, which is much greater than findings of 0.9% and 
1.3% in female high school soccer and lacrosse, respectively (Marshall, Guskiewicz, Shankar, 
McCrea & Cantu, 2015).   
The majority (93.75%) of concussions occurred in training.  Reports from most other sports 
report higher concussion rates in competition at the middle school (Kerr et al., 2017), high school 
(Schulz et al., 2004) and collegiate level (Zuckerman et al., 2015).  This is perhaps due to the 
aesthetic nature of AS and the manner in which athletes compete against one another.  Numerous 
repetitions of routines are performed in practice, so by the time athletes compete the routine 
mistakes resulting in unplanned contact between the athletes are unlikely.  Higher concussion 
incidence in training has also been reported in cheerleading (Marar et al., 2012; Schulz et al., 
2004), another aesthetic sport.  It is important to note that artistic swimmers typically spend a lot 
more time training than they do competing, and without a reliable method of collecting athlete 
exposure data for the present study it remains uncertain whether the concussion rate in training 
truly is higher than in competition. 
The most frequent mechanism of injury was athlete-athlete contact (75%).  This is consistent 
with findings from both male and female youth athletes in other sports (Gessel et al., 2007; 
Marar et al., 2012; Meehan, d’Hemecourt & Comstock, 2010).  Chi-square analysis found a 
63 
 significant relationship between injury type and athlete-athlete contact.  It is important that AS 
be recognized as a contact sport, and the risk of traumatic injury due to contact between artistic 
swimmers be acknowledged.  Clinicians working with artistic swimmers should be aware of the 
possibility of athlete-to-athlete contact and alert for injuries, in particular concussions, to ensure 
these injuries are properly managed. 
5.5.2 Limitations 
The study population was comprised solely of competitive club-level artistic swimmers from a 
single Canadian province.  This limits the generalizability of the findings to other levels of 
athletes and athletes from other provinces and countries.  In addition, limited study resources 
prohibited the collection of athlete exposure data and therefore the calculation of concussion 
incidence rate.  Measuring the incidence rate of concussion in this cohort would have allowed for 
comparisons to other sports, which could have been valuable to help contextualize concussion 
incidence in artistic swimming.   
The injury reports were filled out by coaches, and were based on coach observation of the events.  
It is possible that coaches may not have had a completely accurate interpretation of the events 
that occurred leading to injury, and thus, there may be some error in the reports.  Furthermore, 
the reported incidence proportion and clinical incidence may be lower than the true rates due to 
potential under-reporting and the unknown concussion status of the athletes lost to follow-up.  
Under-reporting has been identified as a serious issue in concussion research (Kerr, Register-
Mihalik, Kroshus, Baugh & Marshall, 2016; Kroshus, Garnett, Hawrilenko, Baugh & Clazo, 
2015).  In addition, there may have been under-reporting of more mild musculoskeletal injuries, 
as they may have been less salient to coaches and therefore not have had injury reports filled out 
for them.  This could lead to an overestimation of the proportion of injuries that were 
concussions.  Additional variables (e.g., time lost due to injury, symptom profiles, recurrent 
concussions) were outside the scope of this study. 
 
5.6 Conclusion 
This study is the first to describe the incidence of concussion in a population of artistic 
swimmers.  The findings are comparable to previous reported incidence from other female 
64 
 athletes of similar age, and suggest that concussions may comprise a greater proportion of 
injuries as compared to other sports.  Similar to findings from other sports, athlete-athlete contact 
is the most common mechanism of injury.  Sport officials and medical clinicians need to be 
aware of the possibility of artistic swimmers to sustain injuries, in particular concussions, from 
contact with another athlete.  This study lays an important foundation for future work by 
providing a framework for injury surveillance in AS, measuring incidence of concussions in a 
population of artistic swimmers, and identifying the primary mechanism of injury.  More 
comprehensive epidemiological study of concussions in artistic swimmers is warranted with 
larger study populations, athlete exposure data and additional variables of interest.

Study Three 
 Building a Concussion Safety Program with a 
Provincial Sport Organization: A Community-Based 
Participatory Research Approach  
 
6.1 Abstract 
The province of Ontario recently enacted Rowan’s Law (2018).  This legislation requires all 
sport organizations to have concussion protocols and education.  Ontario Artistic Swimming 
(OAS) is the provincial sport organization that oversees the sport of artistic swimming in 
Ontario.  This paper describes the collaboration between an academic research team from 
University of Toronto and members of Ontario Artistic Swimming in the design, 
implementation, and evaluation of a sport-specific concussion safety program using a qualitative 
study.  This partnership is discussed in terms of a community-based participatory research 
approach.  The lessons learned from the collaboration, both positive and negative, are 
highlighted. 
 
6.2 Introduction  
Artistic swimming, formerly called synchronized swimming, is a predominately female aesthetic 
sport.  It has grown from theatrical water ballet to become a fast-paced, contact sport.  With the 
increase in contact between athletes comes a concomitant increase in the potential for traumatic 
injuries, including concussions (Mountjoy, 2010).   
Concussions have been estimated to be responsible for close to 35 000 pediatric emergency 
department and physician office visits in Ontario in 2013 (Zemek et al., 2017).  Sport related 
concussion is a traumatic brain injury caused by a direct blow to the head, face, or neck, or an 
indirect blow to the body that results in force being transmitted to the head, sustained through 
participation in sport or physical activity.  It results in functional disturbance of the brain as well 
as clinical signs and symptoms.   
66 
 Recently, the Government of Ontario has recognized the importance of managing sport-related 
concussions properly and promoting concussion safety within schools and community sport 
organizations.  This was enacted in the wake of the death of a young athlete, Rowan Stringer, 
following multiple concussions.  Rowan’s Law (2018) requires sport organizations to have a 
concussion code of conduct, removal from sport protocol, return to sport protocol, and require 
members to read concussion awareness resources.  These requirements present a practical 
problem for many community sport organizations that may lack the knowledge and resources to 
implement a concussion safety program that fulfills all of the conditions set forth in Rowan’s 
Law.  Ontario Artistic Swimming (OAS), formerly Synchro Swim Ontario (SSO), is the 
provincial governing body of artistic swimming in Ontario.  Recognizing a need for data-driven, 
sport-specific concussion resources, a partnership was formed between the principal investigator 
(LMS) and OAS to assist in addressing the requirements of Rowan’s Law and develop a sound 
concussion safety program that would help to protect athlete health and safety moving forward.  
The concussion safety program did not exist prior to the formation of the collaborative 
partnership, and all of the program components were the result of the work of the principal 
investigator with the community representatives.  The program consists of an organizational 
concussion policy (Appendix D), concussion education sessions, concussion management 
guidelines and a sport-specific return to sport protocol (Appendix E), a return to sport progress 
tracking tool for coaches (Appendix F), a concussion information guide for athletes and parents 
(Appendix G), and an injury tracking program.  The entire suite of resources is illustrated in 
Figure 4.  A detailed description of the documents can be found in section 6.4.1, information 
about the education initiatives in section 6.4.2, and a description of the injury tracking program 
in section 6.4.3.  This paper describes the design, implementation, and initial evaluation of the 
OAS concussion safety program, through the collaboration of the provincial sport organization 
and a university-based researcher.

6.3 Program Design 
6.3.1 The Parties 
The partnership was formed between two parties: the research team and the community sport 
organization.  The research team, based out of the University of Toronto, consisted of the 
primary investigator (LMS) and a research supervisor (LMM).  There were three individuals 
from Ontario Artistic Swimming that were centrally involved in the concussion safety program: Organizational

 the executive director (MD), the sport development manager (RK), and the president of the board 
of directors (RB). 
6.3.2 Definition of Roles and Scope 
A key first step in the collaboration process between OAS and LMS was the clarification of the 
roles that each party would take in the different stages of the process.  Clear roles were important 
for the efficiency of the design phase of the program.  As the principal investigator, LMS was 
primarily responsible for identifying the components of the program and the content for same, 
under the supervision of LMM.  OAS provided the technical support and the access to the study 
population, as well as some input into the content of the program and its resources.  It was 
recognized that each party’s roles would be dynamic and could change from beginning to end of 
the process.   
It was also important to clearly define the scope of the concussion safety program, and how each 
party’s roles related to that.  It was agreed that the program would aim to provide resources for 
identifying and managing concussions sustained during OAS-sanctioned events and the 
collection and analysis of data on same, and concussion education for all members within the 
province of Ontario. 
6.3.2.1 Role and Perspectives of the Principal Investigator 
As the principal investigator, I (LMS) was primarily bringing a researcher role to the table in the 
partnership.  However, my extensive experience in the sport allowed me to bring other 
perspectives.  I was a club athlete for 17 years, including 6 years as a National team athlete.  
Having experience at all levels of competition has given me an understanding of the needs of 
athletes at different levels.  In addition, I sustained multiple concussions before retiring from 
artistic swimming.  Living the experience of sport-related concussion gave me an understanding 
of the injury from an athlete’s perspective before I understood it from a scholar’s perspective.  
Furthermore, I have experience as a certified Competition Development coach (the second-
highest coaching certification level in artistic swimming in Canada) and have worked with 
athletes at all different levels, including Novice stream, Provincial stream and National stream 
competitive athletes, as well as an athlete with a disability (AWAD).  Again, this experience has 
provided me with insight into the needs of coaches at various levels.   
69 
 This combination of perspectives, from researcher to athlete to coach, made me uniquely situated 
to be able to carry out this research.  The ability to adopt different viewpoints guided me in the 
conceptualization and execution of this research.  My experience with concussions as an athlete 
has instilled a strong drive to understand these injuries and work to prevent concussions in this 
generation of athletes.  I was able to use my experience as both an athlete and a coach to assist in 
choosing which variables to measure in the empirical studies.  As a researcher and scholar I 
could bring a level of scientific rigor to the investigation of concussions in my sport.  Drawing 
on these multiple perspectives allowed me to execute this research within the community setting 
and strengthened both the program and the partnership by engendering trust and buy-in with the 
community sport organization. 
6.3.3 Identifying Goals 
It was vital to set clear and finite goals for the concussion safety program (Ahmed & Palermo, 
2010).  These goals would guide not only the content of the program components, but also the 
design of the documents and the delivery of the program resources.  The goals of the concussion 
safety program were as follows: 
1. Create and enact an organization-wide concussion policy to be followed by all OAS 
member clubs. 
2. Create and disseminate concussion management guidelines and a return to sport 
protocol that is specific to the sport of artistic swimming. 
3. Create and disseminate concussion information documents for coaches and officials, 
and athletes and parents, specific to the sport of artistic swimming. 
4. Hold sport-specific concussion education sessions for coaches, officials, 
administrators, parents, and athletes. 
5. Develop and implement an injury tracking system to track all injuries incurred by 
OAS members during participation in artistic swimming, including concussions. 
We defined ‘create’ to mean develop and author the respective documents.  In the case of the 
first goal, we defined ‘enact’ the policy to mean that the OAS board of directors would approve 
it and OAS would officially adopt it.  As part of officially adopting the policy, OAS distributed it 
to all member clubs and made it available online.  We defined ‘disseminate’ as ensuring the 
70 
 respective documents were readily available to OAS membership, as well as providing regular 
communication about their existence and where they could be accessed.   
These goals were selected to guide us to our overall objective: build and implement a system to 
objectively monitor injuries sustained while participating in OAS-sanctioned activities, which 
will provide a basis for health and safety policy decisions in the future.  It was important that 
both parties agreed on the global objective of the program and the stepping stones to achieving it, 
so that there was buy-in on both sides (Goodman & Sanders Thompson, 2017). 
 
6.4 Program Implementation 
6.4.1 Document Development  
The partners determined that the various components of the program would need to be rolled out 
sequentially to ensure clarity and avoid overwhelming users with information.  It was recognized 
that the organizational concussion policy document should be first in order to establish a 
rationale for adopting some of the other components.  The policy is renewed every four years 
and is intended to guide the organization’s approach to concussion safety and provide a basis for 
member clubs to write their own concussion policy.  A OAS board member with experience in 
policy writing was the primary author and developer of the policy document.  Once the policy 
was ratified by the board of directors, it was provided to the member clubs and made publicly 
available on the OAS website.  Written in to the policy document was the expression of intent to 
develop and provide additional sport-specific and organization-specific concussion materials. 
The information guide for athletes/parents was developed and written by the research team, and 
contains practical information for managing concussions at home and instructions on returning to 
daily activities following a concussion.  The content for these documents was based on the 
Concussion in Sport Group’s 2012 consensus statement (McCrory et al., 2013) and was 
subsequently updated to reflect the latest consensus statement from the Berlin conference 
(McCrory et al., 2017).  In addition, a sports medicine physician familiar with artistic swimming 
provided input into the “at home” and “return to school” sections of the athlete and parent 
concussion information guide. 
71 
 The concussion management guidelines and sport-specific return to sport protocol were also 
based on the 2012 consensus statement (McCrory et al., 2013).  The research team was tasked 
with displaying the consensus statement content in the artistic swimming context, using sport-
specific terminology and examples to illustrate the concussion management principles.  It was 
important to preserve the scientific soundness of the documents while adapting them to be of the 
most use for the target audience, OAS members.  A key objective of this stage was to put the 
management principles into easy to understand language and an easily consumable format.  
Therefore, the management guidelines and return to sport protocol were both purposely designed 
to be concise, streamlined and easy to read.  These documents are intended for use by coaches 
who suspect an athlete has sustained a concussion or who have an athlete with a diagnosed 
concussion. 
The return to sport progress tracking tool for coaches was developed following a request from a 
coach in the OAS community.  The tool was requested to facilitate a coach’s management of an 
athlete through the return to sport protocol.  It maps directly on to the sport-specific return to 
sport protocol and is intended for use as a companion piece to the protocol document. 
Each of the documents of the concussion safety program were designed with a user-friendly 
approach, in order to balance a scientific basis with a streamlined design.  With the exception of 
the return to sport progress tracking tool, each of the program components can be read and used 
in isolation; however, they were designed as a suite of resources that complement one another. 
6.4.2 Education Initiatives 
Both parties acknowledged the importance of, and need for, education for all OAS members 
(athletes, coaches, officials, parents, and volunteers).  In order to address this need, four separate 
education outreach sessions were conducted with members over the period of three years 
(September 2014, October 2015, October 2016 and September 2017).  The audience for the first 
two sessions consisted of club head coaches and club presidents, the third session audience was 
primarily administrators and officials, and the latest education session was conducted as part of a 
continuing education series for coaches.  The content of these sessions included education about 
what a concussion is and how it occurs, concussion recognition, and sport-specific concussion 
management.   The content of these education sessions was based on the Concussion in Sport 
group consensus statements (McCrory et al., 2013; McCrory et al., 2017) as well as other 
72 
 selections from the sport concussion literature (DiFazio et al., 2015; Giza & Hovda, 2014; 
Mainwaring et al., 2010; Silverberg & Iverson, 2013).  Furthermore, these education sessions 
were used to introduce, explain, and promote the use of the concussion program resources as 
they were developed and introduced to the membership.  A key part of the education initiatives 
was clear communication with members around the objectives of the program, the purpose of 
each of the program components, and the practicalities of how to use the different tools.  This 
was vital to fostering buy-in from the membership and to help promote the adoption and use of 
the program components at the ground level.   
To date, the forms that education has taken has been mostly limited to lecture-style presentations 
at OAS conferences and events.  The face to face approach, as opposed to simply distributing the 
information, was chosen in order to really connect with the membership and provide a forum for 
questions and discussion.  In fact, the concept for the progress tracking tool was born out of a 
discussion session at the end of one of the education sessions.  This tactic has been effective in 
reaching the members who already take an interest in the topic and are ready and willing to 
participate in safe concussion management and injury surveillance.  However, there is a large 
gap in reaching those members who may not have the same interest level or previous knowledge 
of the importance of concussion safety.  More diverse education and communication methods 
need to be employed to enhance membership engagement in the program. 
6.4.3 Injury Tracking 
The fifth goal of the concussion safety program was to develop and implement an injury tracking 
program for use province-wide.  The purpose of the injury tracker is to document injuries of all 
types, for organizational insurance coverage and to collect data to use as a basis for athlete health 
and safety decisions.  OAS expressed a strong interest in extending the concussion safety 
program beyond member education and management resources into injury prevention.  A key 
component of injury prevention efforts is identifying risk factors for injury (van Mechelen, 
1997).  If these factors can be modified, they are reasonable targets for prevention strategies.  
The injury tracking program was designed to gather data on the rate and contexts of concussion 
injuries in order to lay the groundwork for future concussion prevention.  It was decided that it 
would be valuable and important to collect data on all injury types.  The two main reasons for 
this were to provide a basis for comparison for the concussion injury context data, as well as to 
73 
 enable future research focus on different injury types.  For example, OAS members have 
expressed interest in further study of hip injuries in artistic swimmers.  
The tool used for data collection was the PlaySafe Injury Tracker, a free to use online sports 
injury tracking tool that sport organizations can customize to fit their needs.  The PlaySafe Injury 
Tracker was developed by the PlaySafe Initiative, part of the Sunnybrook Office for Injury 
Prevention.  The tracking and prevention component of the concussion safety program is still 
quite new, however; it is important to establish this kind of monitoring in order to have objective 
data.  The results can be used to both identify injury prevention targets and assess the impact of 
education and prevention initiatives.   
The injury tracking program was specifically set up as part of the prospective cohort study of 
concussion incidence and injury factors in artistic swimming (Chapter 5 in this document). The 
study outcomes include the first measurement of concussion incidence in artistic swimming, and 
a description of the contexts in which concussions are occurring in artistic swimming.  These 
important findings lay the groundwork for continuing the tracking program in future seasons, in 
order to continue to measure the incidence of concussion in this population as well as begin to 
isolate targets for intervention with a view to concussion prevention. 
 
6.5 Program Evaluation 
6.5.1 Evaluation Methods and Defining Success 
Both the research team and OAS noted the importance of evaluating the concussion safety 
program through multiple avenues.  A significant first step of evaluation was coming to a 
definition of program success.  We defined success as to what degree the program goals were 
met, positive user feedback, and interest from other artistic swimming provincial sport 
organizations in adopting the program. 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Framework for Program Evaluation in 
Public Health was used to guide the evaluation process (CDC, 1999).  There are six steps in the 
framework: (1) engage stakeholders, (2) describe the program, (3) focus the evaluation design, 
(4) gather credible evidence, (5) justify conclusions and (6) ensure use and lessons learned.  
74 
 When these steps are followed, evaluations are viewed as being more ‘culturally competent’; that 
is, they are conducted through a culturally-appropriate lens and are relevant to the culture of the 
population that the program is serving (CDC, 1999).  A key component of the framework are the 
evaluation standards.  The standards are utility, feasibility, propriety and accuracy, and are 
intended as the “benchmarks” for program evaluations using this framework (Gill, Kuwahara & 
Wilce, 2016).  The evaluation process used by the U of T and OAS partnership followed the 
steps of the CDC framework.  Furthermore, the partners strived to apply the evaluation standards 
to the evaluation of the concussion safety program to ensure the integrity and accuracy of the 
evaluation. 
Multiple types of evaluation were used to measure how well the concussion safety program met 
our definition of success.  To assess how well we met our goals, we held a series of critical 
review meetings throughout the process with representatives from both parties (LMS, MD and 
RB).  The team engaged in some honest self-reflection of both the concussion safety program 
and the research partnership, to explore and define what was successful and what could be 
improved in the future. In addition, coaches who had used the injury tracker were interviewed to 
obtain user feedback on the effectiveness and usefulness of the tracker and their perceptions of 
the concussion safety program as a whole.  General results of the evaluation process can be 
found in the Lessons Learned section.  Specific findings from the meetings can be found below, 
and findings from a qualitative study with the users (coaches) can be found in Chapter 7. 
6.5.1.1 Self-Evaluation 
The self-evaluation process was conducted throughout a series of meetings between LMS from 
the research team and RB, MD and RK from OAS.  The purpose of these meetings was to 
provide updates in terms of findings as data were collected and analyzed, and to reflect on the 
program to date and the process used to develop and roll out the resources.  The meetings 
provided a forum for both sides to offer insights and feedback.  Meetings were conducted in 
person and were held between December 2017 and December 2018.  The representatives from 
OAS indicated that their satisfaction with the program and its components was overall very high.  
Components that were the most positively regarded were the sport-specific management 
guidelines, the return-to-sport protocol, and the injury tracking program.  The SSO team 
members identified that trust between the partners, open communication, and common goals 
75 
 were the biggest facilitators to the success of the partnership.  Three key areas in which to 
improve the program were acknowledged as: seeking input from the national sport organization 
to ensure that the PSO policy and guidelines were aligned with national ones, continuing to 
monitor the requirements of Rowen’s Law as it is updated to ensure compliance with provincial 
government regulations, and the addition of some questions to the injury tracker to expand the 
injury data collected.  OAS proposed that it would be useful to collect data on the education level 
of the coach overseeing the athlete at the time of injury, and LMS proposed that it could be 
important to know the point in time during the training session or competitive event (first third, 
middle third, or last third) that the injury occurred.  Both of these additions were discussed by the 
partners and agreed upon.  The coaching level question was adopted mid-season during the 
2017-2018 competitive season, and the time point question was added to the tracker prior to the 
beginning of the 2018-2019 season. 
The progress of the partnership was compared to the definitions of success that had been 
previously identified.  All five program goals (see Section 6.3.3) were considered to be met.  The 
partnership is in the process of setting new goals; for example, expanding the injury tracker to a 
national level to widen the study population and capture more data.  The feedback from the users 
of the concussion safety program was largely positive.  An important area for improvement that 
was identified through user feedback was that members are much more aware of the injury 
tracker than of the other sport-specific concussion resources.  Based on this feedback, both 
partners agreed that better communication to the members of the existence and purpose of the 
other program resources was needed.  A more in-depth examination of user feedback can be 
found in Section 6.5.2.  Lastly, two other provinces expressed interest in the Ontario program 
resources, with one province officially adopting the sport-specific management guidelines and 
return-to-sport protocol.  With all three definitions of success fulfilled, the partners mutually 
agreed that this important program be continued and improved upon, and that the partnership be 
preserved moving forward.  This can be achieved through the setting of new goals, maintaining 
open communication, and continuing to support mutual input into the program. 
6.5.2 Challenges 
There were a few challenges encountered in both the program design and implementation phases.  
The first challenge encountered in the design stage was the balancing of the wishes of the 
76 
 organization with what is possible using a sound scientific approach.  Understandably, OAS 
wanted recommendations immediately for rule and/or policy changes to reduce concussions.  
However, it wasn’t possible to produce these kind of recommendations so early in the research 
portion of the project.  It is vital that any guidelines or changes are based on objective, sport-
specific data, as well as current sport concussion guidelines.  In order to collect enough data to 
inform any recommendations, the injury surveillance component needs to continue for additional 
seasons.  In a community-academic partnership it is important to consider the organization’s 
input into the research objectives, while maintaining scientific integrity. 
The implementation phase included the injury surveillance study.  The data were hosted by a 
separate organization and had to be obtained by OAS to redact the names before being handed 
over to the researchers for analysis.  The multiple steps to obtain the data created delays in the 
analysis process which made it difficult to adhere to our timelines.  Another challenge 
encountered in the implementation phase was the increased workload on the OAS staff member 
in charge of some of the practical tasks associated with the project (RK).  These practical tasks 
included receiving the incident report data and redacting the identifying information before 
transferring the data to LMS.  While having the organization directly responsible for some tasks 
within the project was mostly beneficial in that it engendered a sense of ownership and 
investment in the project, it also placed demands on RK above and beyond her regular job.  This 
further contributed to timeline delays.   
Despite the challenges encountered, the concussion safety project—and the partnership that 
created and produced it—was generally perceived in a positive manner by both the partners and 
the coaches who were interviewed.  The difficulties identified present opportunities for 
improvement for future collaboration. 
 
6.6 Discussion 
The OAS concussion safety program was an effective partnership between university-based 
researchers from the University of Toronto and the community sport organization Ontario 
Artistic Swimming.  The success of this project has important implications for protecting athlete 
safety while participating in artistic swimming in Ontario.  The most fruitful aspects of the 
77 
 working relationship between the partners were the clear and continuous communication 
between the parties, the mutual input into the objectives of the project, and the sharing of the 
roles and responsibilities of the project implementation.  Goodman and Sanders Thompson 
(2017) have described a spectrum of stakeholder involvement in Community Engagement in 
Research (CER).  According to their classification, our partnership would be classified as 
“Collaboration” which is part of the “Engaged Participation” category.  In collaboration both 
parties have an active contribution in the design and execution of the research and analysis of the 
findings with mutual benefit and a balance of power (Goodman & Sanders Thompson, 2017).   
The guiding principles behind our partnership are aligned with the values of CER outlined by the 
National Institute of Health (NIH).  Namely, our research relationship involves a strong 
researcher-community partnership, clear and relevant research goals, mutual benefit and equal 
respect for both parties, and the translation of the findings into policies and programs (Ahmed & 
Palermo, 2010).   
This collaboration between the university-based research team and the provincial sport 
organization representing the artistic swimming community in Ontario is an excellent example of 
community-based participatory research (CBPR).  CBPR enhances the creation and translation of 
knowledge by directly involving communities in projects (Cornwall & Jewkes, 1995).  Main 
benefits of this research approach include community-supported interventions, expanding of 
research discourse beyond academia and into the “real world”, and sustaining programs and 
long-term relationships between partners of mutual benefit (Wallerstein & Duran, 2010).   
The partnership between University of Toronto researchers and OAS exemplified many aspects 
of the Revised CBPR Conceptual Model (Belone at al., 2016).  This model was adapted to 
describe the partnership by preserving the constructs that applied to this situation and explaining 
how each is applicable.  Constructs that were not relevant to the collaboration experience were 
not included.  In the model, group dynamics work within contexts to produce intervention and 
research, which leads to outcomes.  Many aspects of the Contexts construct matched with the 
experience of our collaboration.  The enactment of Rowan’s Law pushed ahead the creation of 
organizational policy and the awareness of the need for resources.  Members of OAS involved in 
the concussion safety project brought specialized skills and experience that were important in the 
creation of many of the program components.  Similarly, the primary investigator (LMS) brought 
78 
 a unique combination of scientific research skills and a deep knowledge of the sport of artistic 
(synchronized) swimming.  This greatly facilitated the design and creation of the concussion 
safety program and its components.  In addition, the perceived importance of the health issue at 
hand, sport-related concussion, was quite high amongst the partners and the community.  There 
was overlap between the Group Dynamics construct and our partnership as well.  The 
partnership has existed for several years, which facilitates trust between the partners.  Both 
parties had high motivation to participate in the program, and there were pre-existing personal 
relationships between members of the partners, which collectively increased buy-in from both 
sides.  Furthermore, LMS was in the position to act as a bridge person between both parties 
given her role as the principal investigator and her reputation amongst the OAS community as a 
coach and a former athlete.  The use of flexible dialogue and participatory decision-making, 
along with the willingness on both sides to engage in mutual learning and self-reflection, 
strengthened the relational dynamics of the partnership.  Likewise, the use of—and recognition 
of the importance of doing so—language specific to the sport and to the OAS community helped 
to reinforce the relationship between the parties.  Lastly, these aspects were reflected in the 
intervention and research components of the concussion safety program, which has directly led 
to new policies and resources and an increase in capacity of both parties.  In time, this should 
lead to improved health outcomes in the form of a decreased risk of concussions.  An adapted 
version of the Revised CBPR Conceptual Model can be found in Figure 5. 
79 
 Figure 4. Map of OAS-researcher partnership on to the Revised CBPR Conceptual Model 
(adapted from Belone et al., 2016). 
Sharing the power of decision-making and responsibilities of the project amongst both parties, 
and maintaining consistent communication, allowed for the growth and evolution of the 
concussion safety project beyond what could have been accomplished alone.  That being said, 
there is still room to grow.  The main lessons that were taken away from this collaborative 
partnership experience are presented below. 
 
6.7 Lessons Learned  
This partnership, the design of the OAS concussion safety project, and the development of the 
project components, have provided some important lessons for future CBPR projects with 
community sport organizations.  The main take-away lessons from this project are as follows: 
Contexts 
Policy Trends: Rowan’s Law. 
Community Capacity: Members 
of OAS have needed skills and 
experience. 
University Capacity: Research 
team possessed necessary skills 
and experience.

 • Trust and Respect Amongst Parties :  The strength of the relationship between the 
academic research team and Ontario Artistic Swimming was bolstered by mutual trust 
and respect between the partners.  This was fostered in multiple ways.  First, there 
was a pre-existing relationship between the principal investigator, LMS, and some 
members of the OAS project team.  This was beneficial as it facilitated the dialogue 
between partners, especially in the earlier phases of the project.  Second, both parties 
had input into the scope of the project, the number and type of resources created as 
part of the project, and the content of some of the project components.  The 
opportunity to have input allowed the community partner to feel that their ideas were 
valued and respected by the academic research team.  Third, a regular flow of 
communication allowed each partner to trust that the other was meeting their 
responsibilities to the project, which in turn engendered trust between the parties.  
This is discussed further in the next lesson.  
• Consistent Communication :  Communication was maintained continuously 
throughout the design, implementation, and evaluation of the concussion safety 
project.  This was vital to the project’s success.  Strong communication affords 
efficiency and promotes the achievement of research objectives by stimulating the 
flow of work on the project.  In addition, roles can be clearly maintained as both 
parties stay on the same page.  Communication was sustained through electronic mail 
and regular meetings.  As mentioned above, regular check-ins assist in the building 
and maintenance of trust between the research partners. 
• Community Contribution : The Ontario artistic swimming community was involved 
in the project both through OAS representing them as their governing body, and via 
direct feedback from community members to the research team.  This feedback was 
gathered through both formal and informal processes.  The formal evaluation process 
involved interviewing members of the OAS community—head coaches of OAS 
member clubs—to elicit feedback on the resources developed through the concussion 
safety program.  This feedback is being used to evolve the concussion safety 
program.  Informally, feedback was gathered during some of the education sessions 
put on as part of the program.  The most significant incorporation of informal 
feedback was the development of the progress tracker at the request of coaches who 
had managed concussed athletes.  Listening to the community and considering their 
81 
 feedback creates a feeling of investment in the project in the community members 
which in turn enhances their participation in the research arm of the concussion safety 
program and their use of the program resources. 
• Data Collection/Hosting : A crucial part of the concussion safety program is the 
injury tracking research program.  This tracking program was greatly facilitated by a 
collaboration with the PlaySafe Initiative, based out of Sunnybrook Health Sciences 
Centre in Toronto, Canada.  This organization has produced a tool called the PlaySafe 
Injury Tracker, a web-based application customizable for sports organizations to 
collect data on any injuries that occur in the course of participating in sport.  Access 
to the PlaySafe Injury Tracker greatly shortened the time it took to launch the 
research arm of the program as it provided an established tool with which to collect 
the injury data.  However, there was a significant drawback to using the PlaySafe 
tool, and that was the data storage location.  All the data collected using the PlaySafe 
Injury Tracker is hosted on the Sunnybrook servers, and neither the university-based 
researchers nor the OAS team had direct access to the data.  The involvement of a 
third party created difficulties in accessing the data.  The analysis was performed by 
LMS in the University of Toronto Concussion Lab, but the data had to be transferred 
from PlaySafe to OAS where the names were redacted, and then on to LMS.  Delays 
were created by the data having to pass through multiple hands.  Future research by 
community-academic partnerships should carefully consider how and where data is 
being stored, and who will have access to the data.  Privacy and protection of 
participant identifying information should be protected, while efficiency of data 
access should be maximized.   
• Task Burden on Organization : One of the contributors to the success of the 
concussion safety program was the high level of involvement by the community 
organization.  This enhanced investment in the project through a feeling of ownership 
facilitated progress, however; it placed a burden on the staff members involved.  
Tasks associated with the program competed with the duties associated with their 
regular jobs.  This resulted in both strain on the team members, and decreased 
efficiency in completing program objectives.  The burden on each partner should be 
considered in a community-academic collaboration, and steps taken to minimize 
strain on team members due to tasks associated with research and programming. 
82 
  
6.8 Conclusion 
The collaboration between academic researchers from University of Toronto and the community 
sport organization Ontario Artistic Swimming was an overall success.  Valuable program 
resources, an important line of research, and a lasting partnership between the parties were born 
out of this collaboration.  The resources developed as part of the concussion safety program are 
all still in use by OAS and its membership.  In addition, some program components have been 
adopted by other provincial artistic swimming organizations.  Important lessons from the 
collaborative experience are potentially useful for future collaborative partnerships between 
academic researchers and community sport organizations.

 Chapter 7  
Study Four 
 Coach Perceptions of Concussion Resources  
7.1 Abstract 
Through a collaborative partnership between Ontario Artistic Swimming (OAS) and researchers 
from the University of Toronto, a program of sport-specific concussion resources was developed 
and implemented.  A crucial part of the evaluation process was gathering feedback from the end 
users of the program, the member coaches.  In order to achieve this, a qualitative study was 
employed to examine coaches’ perceptions of the injury tracker.  Important findings on coaches’ 
attitudes towards injury reporting and surveillance are reported, as well as specific implications 
for enhancing injury tracker use.  Recommendations for facilitating coaches’ use of the tracker, 
and the OAS sport-specific concussion resources, are presented. 
 
7.2 Introduction  
Athletic injury can have negative consequences on an athlete’s physical, mental and emotional 
health (Dawes & Roach, 1997; Leddy, Lambert & Ogles, 1994; Russell, Tracey, Wiese-Bjornstal 
& Canzi, 2018; Von Rosen, Kottorp, Fridén, Frohme & Heijne, 2018).  Furthermore, previous 
injury can increase the likelihood that an athlete will incur a subsequent injury (Giroto, 
Hespanhol Junior, Gomes & Lopes, 2017; Hӓgglund, Waldén & Ekstrand, 2006; Whittaker, 
Small, Maffey & Emery, 2015). 
Injury prevention is a key part of protecting athletes’ health and well-being.  The ‘sequence of 
prevention’ of sports injuries is composed of four stages: establishing the extent of the problem, 
establishing the injury etiology and mechanisms, introducing preventative measures and 
assessing the effectiveness of those measures, specifically through repeating the first step (van 
Mechelen, Hlobil & Kemper, 1992).  Application of the ‘sequence of prevention’ requires an 
injury surveillance system, ideally one that is able to support all the stages in the sequence (van 
Mechelen, 1997).  Given the specificity of injury types and etiologies in different sports, 
oftentimes a sport-specific system is warranted (van Mechelen, 1997). 
84 
 With this in mind, the partners in the Ontario Artistic Swimming (OAS) concussion safety 
program determined that a sport-specific injury surveillance program was needed to track 
injuries to artistic swimming athletes in the province.  The collaborative partnership behind the 
OAS concussion safety program consisted of three administrators from OAS (RB, MD and RK) 
and two researchers from the University of Toronto (LMS and LMM).  The principal 
investigator was LMS.  The aim of the program was to develop sport-specific concussion 
resources.  The program consists of a concussion policy, an information guide for athletes and 
parents, concussion management guidelines and return-to-pool protocol, a return to sport 
progress tracking tool for coaches, concussion education sessions for coaches and administrators, 
and an injury tracking program.  While the injury tracker was developed as part of the 
concussion safety program, it is intended to track and record all injuries sustained as a result of 
artistic swimming participation and not just concussions.  The questions in the tracker were 
reviewed for face and content validity during the development process.  Following the 
implementation of the resources in the OAS community, the partners began an evaluation 
process to assess the utility and effectiveness of the concussion safety program, particularly the 
injury tracking component. 
We recognized that coaches would play an important role in the implementation and evaluation 
of the injury tracker.  The relationship between youth athletes and their coaches has been 
described as potentially the most significant relationship with an adult in these athletes’ lives 
(Gervis & Dunn, 2004).  Previous research has recognized the critical role that a coach can play 
in an athlete’s injury management and rehabilitation (Bianco, 2001; Johnston & Carroll, 1998).  
Due to their important position on the frontlines of injury management, we believed that a crucial 
part of the evaluation process would be to hear the coaches’ perceptions of the injury tracker.  In 
order to capture the amount of detail we believed was necessary to describe the coach 
perspective, and to allow the voices of the coaches to be heard, a qualitative approach was 
deemed to be the most appropriate manner in which to investigate. 
Qualitative research methods are useful for gathering descriptive data in participants’ own voices 
(Taylor, Bogdan & DeVault, 2015).  Qualitative methods have been used previously in program 
evaluation in various fields including special education and disability (Bogdan & Taylor, 1990), 
early childhood mental health (Williams, Joyner, Matic & Lakatos, 2019), physician training 
(Neff et al., 2017) and childbirth support (Richards & Lanning, 2019).  Adopting a qualitative 
85 
 approach to evaluation allows the researcher to move beyond collecting facts about the program 
to incorporate human and contextual aspects that are important in understanding a user’s 
perspective (Guba & Lincoln, 1989). 
 
7.3 Method 
7.3.1 Paradigmatic Position and Researcher Perspective 
The purpose of this study was to evaluate coaches’ perspectives of the usefulness and 
effectiveness of the concussion safety program resources, primarily the online injury tracker.  In 
order to achieve this, a qualitative study was conducted from a post-positivist paradigmatic 
position.  A paradigm is a set of beliefs that represent a worldview from which the researcher 
defines the world and their place in it (Guba & Lincoln, 1994).  Post-positivism is an evolution 
of the positivist paradigm, which asserts that truth can only be obtained through verified and 
replicable findings of directly observable processes (Clark, 1998).  Positivism assumes an 
objective reality completely apart from the observer, and centers on the desire of the researcher 
to explain and control phenomena (Guba & Lincoln, 1994).  It has long been criticized for its 
reductionist and deterministic approach (Guba & Lincoln, 1994; Keat, 1980).  Where post-
positivism differs is the researcher, and their associated beliefs and perceptions, are recognized 
as being connected to investigation rather than completely disconnected from reality (Clark, 
1998).  In terms of epistemology, which is concerned with the nature of knowledge and the 
assumptions and beliefs we have of that nature, post-positivism takes a modified 
dualist/objectivist approach in the sense that while it is recognized that true dualism is likely not 
possible, an objective approach is considered ideal (Guba & Lincoln, 1994).  In terms of 
ontology, which is concerned with the nature of reality and our assumptions and beliefs about 
reality, post-positivism has a critical realism, which assumes that a distinct objective reality 
exists but that our ability to understand it is inherently influenced by our own biases and thus 
reality can only be known imperfectly (Guba & Lincoln, 1994).   
Working from this perspective, my goal as the principal investigator (PI) was to understand the 
coaches’ perceptions of the tracker as a representation of the real usefulness and ease of use of 
the tracker.  My own beliefs and lived experiences would have interacted with and influenced 
86 
 how I conducted the study and how I interpreted the data, leading to an imperfect understanding 
of the coaches’ reality.  My aim was to understand enough to be able to generate 
recommendations for ways to modify the tracker that would improve coaches’ perceptions of it 
and ultimately increase its use within the community.  As a fellow coach and member of the 
community, my position as a participant-observer allowed me to have a better and closer 
understanding of the other coaches’ experiences.  By ‘speaking the same language’ as my 
participants, I was able to develop a degree of trust with them that an outsider to the community 
would not have been able to within the same time frame.  This trust and understanding allowed 
the participants to feel more comfortable in sharing their perspectives and allowed me a closer 
understanding of their reality than I otherwise would have had. 
7.3.2 Participants 
Feedback was sought from coaches in the province that had experience with the injury tracker.  
A convenience sample of three coach participants represented clubs from three of the four 
competitive regions in Ontario (East, Central and West).  Inclusion criteria for coaches was as 
follows: coach-of-record of competitive athletes during the 2017-2018 season, and had used the 
injury tracker at least once in the last year.   
The three participants, designated as C1, C2, and C3 were all from different competitive clubs in 
different regions.  C1 is the head coach of a large club from the Central competitive region.  She 
primarily coaches Junior level athletes; however, as the head coach she is involved to a certain 
degree with all competitive athletes in the club.  She holds her NCCP Level IV and is also an 
accomplished mental performance skills consultant.  At the time of interview, C1 had used the 
online tracker several times, including once for a concussion.  C2 is a competitive coach at a 
large club in the West competitive region.  She did not coach a team in the 2017-2018 season but 
was the coach of record for competitive athletes in extra routines (i.e. solos and duets).  As of the 
time of study participation, she had used the injury tracker twice.  C3 is the Lead Competitive 
coach of a large club in the East competitive region.  At the time of her interview, she had filled 
out the injury tracker numerous times, including multiple times for concussions.  C2 and C3 are 
both CAC Competition Development certified.  Due to the relatively small size of the 
community, no other demographic information is reported in order to protect participants’ 
anonymity. 
87 
 7.3.3 Interviews 
This study was approved by the University of Toronto Research Ethics Board (Protocol #34507).  
Participants were recruited through the investigator directly.  Semi-structured interviews were 
conducted, and the guide for these interviews can be found in Appendix H.  Questions focused 
on the coaches’ perceptions of the injury tracker as well as their and their athletes’ concussion 
knowledge.  Their attitudes towards injury tracking in general were also explored.  Informed 
consent was obtained before each of the interviews began.  The consent form can be found in 
Appendix I.  The interviews were audio-recorded using the Voice Recorder application for 
iPhone (2018), and the recordings were transcribed verbatim by the PI.  Notes on the emphasis 
and focus of the participants’ answers were taken during each interview.  The text of the 
transcripts were analyzed using content analysis in the method described below. 
7.3.4 Analysis 
In order to address the stated purpose of the study, a qualitative content analysis of semi-
structured interviews was conducted.  Content analysis originated from communication sciences, 
where it started as a quantitative method for analyzing large amounts of text (Mayring, 2004).  
The fundamental idea of content analysis is that a greater amount of text can be organized and 
collapsed down into a fewer number of categories (Weber, 1990).  The way these categories are 
interpreted and presented depends on the goal of the researcher.  Whereas a quantitative content 
analysis organizes the text into pre-determined categories through explicit counts of codes, a 
qualitative content analysis is more concerned with interpreting the latent meanings of the 
communication (Kondracki, Wellman & Amundson, 2002).  The text being analyzed can be 
obtained through various methods, including participant interviews. 
The interviews were analyzed with an inductive content analysis approach by the principal 
investigator (LMS).  This approach was selected as it is appropriate for describing a phenomenon 
when existing literature is limited (Hsieh & Shannon, 2005) and allows the researcher to make 
valid inferences from the data to provide an insight into or representation of the phenomenon 
under investigation (Elo & Kyngӓs, 2008).  In a conventional  qualitative content analysis, data 
codes are derived from the data itself rather than pre-conceived before analysis begins, as is the 
case with directive and summative  approaches (Hsieh & Shannon, 2005).  This has the benefit of 
88 
 resulting in themes that develop from the data rather than themes being imposed on the data 
(Hsieh & Shannon, 2005). 
The analysis process followed the steps outlined by Elo and Kyngas (2008) and Hsieh and 
Shannon (2005).  First, the transcripts were read through like a story to get an overall sense of 
the participants’ perspectives. The transcripts were then read through again in a more focused 
manner and parsed into meaning units.  Next, codes were given to the meaning units and 
recorded in the margins.  Codes were transferred to coding sheets and grouped into clusters in a 
meaningful way.  These groups were the themes that flowed from the data. 
This approach was considered inductive in the sense that analysis was not guided by a theoretical 
framework or by existing literature.  Some qualitative researchers question the extent to which 
the process described above is truly inductive.  Cassidy (2019) points out that most qualitative 
research involves both inductive and deductive processes, and viewing induction and deduction 
as completely binary is limiting.  Some researchers advocate for an ‘abductive’ approach to 
analysis, in which there is movement back and forth between inductive and deductive processes 
to relate observations to theory (Ryba, Haapanen, Mosek & Ng, 2012).  Schwandt (1997) notes 
that qualitative analysis usually involves all three forms of analytic approaches.  For the purposes 
of classifying the analytic approach, this study can be considered to be inductive in its analysis 
insofar as themes were generated directly from the participant responses, while acknowledging 
that deductive processes did come into play in terms of the selected interview questions which 
were derived from the study’s stated purpose. 
 
7.4 Results 
Overall perceptions of the program by the coaches were very positive and afforded important 
information for improving the injury tracker.  Although all three coaches stated some minimal 
awareness of the other OAS sport-specific concussion resources, they did not feel familiar 
enough with them to provide any feedback.  This was an important result in and of itself.  As 
collaborating partners we felt that we had communicated effectively with the community about 
the other resources.  Given the results of these interviews, our communication needs to improve 
to bring more awareness of the additional OAS resources to the community.   
89 
 Four main themes were developed from the interview data: injury reporting, importance of injury 
tracking, facilitators to using the tracker, and barriers to using the tracker.  Each of these themes 
and their corresponding sub-themes are described below.  Quotes from the participants are 
included to illustrate some of the sub-themes and provide voice to the participants. 
7.4.1 Injury Reporting 
Coaches reported that prior to the OAS injury tracker, their clubs attempted to keep track of 
athletes’ injuries through paper reports completed as part of facility requirements.  All three 
participants identified instances of chronic injuries that were not reported in the OAS injury 
tracker, however; they felt that acute injuries were being captured quite well.  Three common 
reasons for not reporting chronic injuries were identified: (1) unaware that chronic injuries 
should be logged in the tracker, (2) lack of clarity as to what constitutes an actual injury, and (3) 
disagreement with the expectation that all chronic injuries should be logged.   
Coaches all reported being very aware of the need to report traumatic injuries, especially any 
blow to the head or suspected concussion.  However, awareness of needing to use the system for 
chronic injuries was lower: 
“I’m going to be honest, the only time I would fill it out is if it’s a new like traumatic, 
‘getting pulled out of the water’ injury.  If it’s a chronic, over-use, tired… it’s not even on 
my radar to fill it in right now.” C1 
Participants also identified the difficulty in making the judgement call of when to call a chronic 
condition an actual injury, and which chronic problems should or shouldn’t be reported.  
Participants were unsure of what a reasonable ‘threshold’ for reporting a problem as an injury 
should be: 
“It’s hard to say because with chronic injuries, sometimes they aren’t even happening at 
the pool, they’re just sort of coming up.  So it’s hard to identify, because there’s no big 
moment.” C3 
“The last one I did was a chronic illness, and she’s already been seeking medical 
attention but she was like collapsed in the bathroom.  So I was like ‘this has to be 
reported’, but it’s a chronic condition…that one I didn’t really know if I was supposed to.  
90 
 I think I remember during that [report] being like ‘I don’t know if I should be reporting 
this or not’.”  C2 
“If they are missing, sitting out or modifying, for a week, then something would have to 
be done.  Or the other marker, is any time they have to go to a doctor.  Although I have to 
be honest, I’m not doing that now either.” C3 
There was also a feeling amongst the coaches that reporting each and every little problem was 
too onerous and an unrealistic expectation for a coach.  This tied into the concept of a lack of 
clarity around the threshold for reporting: 
“I’m just trying to think about the sheer volume.  Like if we have 100 swimmers [in the 
club], and every one of them has at least one incident a year, of overuse and tiredness, 
and some people up to 6, you’re looking at us potentially filling in that [tracker] up to 600 
times for chronic overuse…that’s a lot of time spent filling out stuff.  Is that a reasonable 
ask of the coaching staff of Ontario?  I don’t think so.” C1 
Despite a positive regard for the injury tracker, coaches are not reporting all injuries to OAS.  
This appears to stem from both feelings of confusion around what constitutes a reportable 
incident, and disagreement about the threshold for reporting an incident and the potential burden 
on a coach. 
7.4.2 Importance of Injury Tracking 
In contrast to their feelings around reporting chronic injuries, all three coaches reported that 
keeping track of injuries in general was important to them as a coach and in line with their 
personal coaching philosophy.  Two of the participants identified group insurance coverage 
through the provincial sport organization as a reason that tracking was important:   
“Super important, not only because everything should be recorded, but even for 
something like insurance purposes.  Like if it did happen at a competition or at a practice, 
that could be covered by Synchro Ontario’s insurance, and that could help because some 
parents don’t have that.” C2 
91 
 All three coaches felt that tracking injuries would encourage follow up and proper recovery by 
enhancing communication between coaches and healthcare professionals.  There was also a 
perception that injury tracking could improve athlete safety and keep athletes participating in 
sport longer: 
“It’s just, you can always go back to it, it’s there and it’s monitored.  Then the coach can 
be on top of following up, and the parents are identified…it’s just good communication.” 
C2 
“I would say I put a pretty high [importance], especially with having athletes that are 
there all the time, it’s important to know what steps we’re at and following up with 
physicians too when need be.  Some of our kids are definitely injury-prone and work a lot 
with physio and stuff, so it’s good to know where we’re at and what we need to adjust in 
training, to keep them in the sport longer.” C3 
Coaches reported belief in the importance of collecting information about injuries in their 
athletes, which appears to conflict with their behaviour of letting some injuries go unreported. 
7.4.3 Facilitators to User Friendly Tracking 
The overall impression of the online injury tracker was very positive, with all three coaches 
describing it as “easy to use” and user-friendly.  The participants identified the following as 
facilitating the use of the injury tracker: (1) online access, (2) comprehensive list of answer 
options, (3) option to enter additional explanation/information, and (4) makes the medical bye 
process easier:   
“The fact that it’s online, it’s easy to just pull it up.  Very rarely am I struggling to input 
anything.  It seems to be pretty fast and efficient, and it makes it easier to go through the 
medical bye process later if needed, because that step has already been taken.” C3 
“I think the new system is way speedier, just in terms of the options going through, it’s a 
bit more accessible just to find exactly what you’re looking for especially based on the 
length, and where it was, and what happened, I think there is like every option at this 
point, and I’ve yet to have to click the other button.” C3 
92 
 “You know it’s a good mix of having check boxes and having a space that I could write 
stuff out.  I liked having that space to write out, because there were times that I didn’t 
really know what to do, but I can explain more in depth in the boxes where it allows me 
to.  Super easy.  It is convenient and doesn’t take that much time.”  C2 
Participants identified several logistical aspects of the tracker that increase its ease of use.  It is 
important to recognize the facilitators to using the tracker, so that OAS can maintain and enhance 
those features.   
7.4.4 Barriers to Injury Tracker Use 
The participating coaches identified the following barriers to using the injury tracker: (1) the link 
to the tracker was difficult to find the first time it was used, (2) some of the information asked for 
wasn’t always on hand (e.g. birthdates), (3) not mobile friendly, and (4) no option to save and 
continue later: 
“All the communication comes through the head coach.  I don’t recall seeing it obvious 
on the website, like not right on the first page.” C2 
“It was a bit hard at first.  Like we knew it was a thing but the links weren’t quite there all 
the time or it wasn’t as easy to access, it wasn’t on the home page right away so that 
made it a bit harder.  I also think just going off of a paper system was a bit of a different 
change, rather than just relying on the pool but making sure everything is followed 
through on that.” C3 
“Probably the hardest part is birthdates, depending on what it is, generally you can’t pull 
that up, and you don’t have that…that would make it the most challenging I think.” C3 
As with the facilitators to using the tracker, the coaches focused on logistics when discussing the 
barriers to using it.  It is equally important to recognize the barriers to use, so that OAS can begin 
to address them and enable more coaches to use the tracker. 
 
93 
 7.5 Discussion 
The coaches who participated in the interviews provided valuable information about their 
perceptions of the OAS injury tracker.  The four main themes that described the data were as 
follows: injury reporting, importance of injury tracking, facilitators to using the tracker and 
barriers to using the tracker.  The process used to arrive at these themes was inductive in the 
sense that no outside theories or models were imposed.  However, it is important to note that 
there is an element of deduction in the sense that participant responses were guided by the 
interview questions, which likely influenced the manner in which they answered the questions 
and how I interpreted the answers.  Nevertheless, given that the main purpose of this study was 
to examine coaches’ perceptions of the OAS concussion resources and especially the injury 
tracker, the structured nature of the responses is appropriate given the applied nature of the 
research. 
The coaches interviewed were all quite aware of and comfortable with using the online injury 
tracker resource.  However, their awareness of the other OAS concussion safety program 
resources was very low by comparison.  This indicates the need for more frequent and effective 
communication from OAS to the membership about the sport-specific concussion resources 
available, as well as how to use them and where to find them.  
All of the participants described being aware of instances when injuries, particularly chronic 
injuries, occurred in their athletes or athletes in their club that were not recorded in the injury 
tracker.  This indicated a need for greater clarity and communication around when/what to report 
through the injury tracker.  Under-reporting of injuries in sports has been studied previously 
(Chrisman, Quitiquit & Rivara, 2013; Sanderson, Weathers, Snedaker & Gramlich, 2017; Wiese-
Bjornstal, 2010), however the majority of work has been examining under-reporting from an 
athlete perspective.  The fact that all three coaches, each from a different club, knew about 
unreported incidents suggests that this is a pervasive problem in the community.  Discussion of 
unreported incidents led into questions around what the appropriate ‘threshold’ for reporting an 
injury is, and what a reasonable expectation is in terms of the logistical demands of injury 
reporting on coaches.  Youth sport coaches wear many hats and tend to have numerous 
responsibilities outside the pool or playing field associated with their role, and injury reporting 
may take a backseat to other duties like scheduling and parent communication.  It would be ideal 
94 
 to have additional personnel, such as athletic trainers, to report injuries to the surveillance 
program.  Yard, Collins and Comstock (2009) found that high school coaches participating in an 
injury surveillance program only submitted 55 injury reports and 36.5% of expected exposures, 
as compared to 338 reports and 96.7% of expected exposures submitted by athletic trainers.  In 
the National Football League (NFL) and National Hockey League (NHL) athletic trainers review 
video feed and act as “spotters”, which takes responsibility of reporting out of the athletes’ and 
coaches’ hands (Davis et al., 2018).  Unfortunately, due to the limited resources of OAS clubs, it 
is not feasible to have an athletic trainer to act as a spotter or manage injury reporting. 
Despite the acknowledged under-reporting of injuries, all of the participants felt that injury 
tracking was important to them as a coach.  This dichotomy between supporting the idea of 
injury tracking and knowingly letting injuries go unrecorded highlights the importance of 
determining the facilitators and barriers to coaches using the tracker, and translating this 
feedback into actual modifications to the system.  The participants indicated that the online 
access, comprehensive list of answer options, option to enter additional information and the 
expedition of the medical bye process all facilitated their use of the tracker.  The four barriers to 
using the tracker were identified as: the visibility of the link, limited access to some of the 
information requested, the inability to use it on a mobile device and the lack of an option to save 
and return to it later.  Any changes that can be made to the tracker to make it as logistically easy 
for coaches as possible should be implemented to encourage its use.  Time and logistical 
considerations have been cited in other injury prevention research as barriers for coaches (Joy et 
al., 2013; Norcross, Johnson, Bovbjerg, Koester & Hoffman, 2016; Saunders et al., 2010).  
Facilitating the logistics of using the tracker will hopefully serve to increase reporting, as 
coaches have indicated their belief in the importance of the program and their concern for their 
athletes’ health and well-being.   
As with all studies, there were limitations to this qualitative study.  First, the sample size of three 
coaches falls below what has historically been considered necessary to achieve saturation, with 
researchers recommending sample sizes between 5 and 36 depending on the type of qualitative 
inquiry (Guest, Bunce & Johnston, 2006).  However, approaching this from the perspective of 
data saturation rather than theoretical saturation indicates that saturation can be thought of as the 
repetition of responses (Fusch & Ness, 2015) or the redundancy of responses (Grady, 1998).  
From that perspective, saturation was reached in this study in that there were no new themes that 
95 
 developed after the third participant’s transcript was analyzed.  Second, due to practical 
considerations a convenience sample was taken.  Interpretation of the findings is potentially 
more limited than if purposeful or critical case sampling was used, in which a wider range of 
perspectives may have been accessed.  Third, only coaches who had used the injury tracker were 
included in the sample.  Hearing from those coaches that did not sue the tracker may have 
provided valuable insight and feedback into the true barriers to using the program.  Nevertheless, 
this study reports important information about how the OAS injury tracker is perceived by the 
main users of the system.  This information is valuable in modifying and improving the tracker 
to encourage its use by the coaches in Ontario. 
 
7.6 Conclusion and Implications 
Coaches in Ontario are the ‘end-users’ of the online injury tracker and many of the OAS 
concussion safety program resources.  General impressions of the online injury tracker were very 
positive, and coaches reported that the tool is very easy to use, primarily due to the online access 
and the comprehensive nature of the options.  Findings from the coach interviews suggest that 
more communication is needed to the SSO membership about the variety and breadth of sport-
specific concussion resources that are available, and more clarity is needed around what 
constitutes a ‘reportable’ chronic condition and what a reasonable threshold is for doing so. 
It is important to continue to collect feedback data in order to further enhance the program, as 
well as ensure that the resources are accessible, user-friendly and effective.  This will serve to 
promote their use within the community, and assist in keeping the athletes healthy and safe.  
Future evaluation of the tracker and the other OAS resources should employ different sampling 
strategies, and ideally should include those coaches that have not used the tracker in order to 
better our understanding of barriers to using it.  Future studies would also benefit from increasing 
the sample size to hear from more coaches and potentially gain some new perspectives. 
Based on the findings from this study, I have made the following recommendations to OAS for 
improving the injury tracker and the concussion program resources: 
96 
  Create a clear guideline for reporting chronic injuries and communicate that to the 
community 
 Consult with coaches from the community to determine a reasonable threshold for 
determining a reportable incident and communicate that to the membership 
 Continue to host the injury tracker online and dovetail it into the medical bye process 
 Upgrade the software hosting the tracker to be mobile-friendly 
 Provide an option for a user to save their progress and continue at a later time 
 Move the link to the tracker to the OAS homepage  
 Increase communication to the community about the breadth of sport-specific concussion 
resources available through OAS and where they can be accessed 
Results from this study indicate that artistic swimming coaches value injury-reporting and care 
about their athletes’ health and safety.  By implementing improvements to the OAS injury 
tracking program, we can harness the coaches’ desire to protect athletes’ well-being and increase 
injury reporting in the community.

General Discussion 
 Discussion  
8.1 Chapter Summaries  
This section summarizes the previous chapters and discuss the results of the program of research 
within the context of the current literature.  Each of the three studies are summarized followed by 
a discussion of the relevant literature.  Literature for comparison will include concussion 
incidence in amateur youth sports, descriptive epidemiology of concussion in youth sports, and 
community engaged research. 
8.1.1 Chapter 4: Concussions in Youth Artistic Swimmers: A Retrospective 
Descriptive Study 
The purpose of the retrospective descriptive study of concussion in Ontario amateur artistic 
swimmers was to describe and characterize the injury contexts in which these concussions are 
occurring.  To date, there are no known studies of concussions in this population.  The main 
research objective of this study was to determine which aspects of artistic swimming were more 
likely to lead to a concussion.  To address this objective, data were collected on the following 
factors related to concussions sustained while participating in artistic swimming: (1) the 
mechanism of injury, (2) the seasonal training phase in which it occurred, (3) the location in 
which it occurred, (4) the competitive age group the athlete was in at the time of the injury, (5) 
the type of activity the athlete was participating in when the injury occurred, (6) the specific 
aspect of training in which the athlete was engaged at the time of injury, and (7) the time-loss 
participating in sport due to the injury.  Participants were also asked who diagnosed their 
concussion as a quality check to ensure data reflected concussions diagnosed by medical doctors.   
Data on the injury contexts were collected through an on-line survey tool.  An invitation to 
participate in the survey was sent to all SSO member clubs via email, with instructions that the 
invitation be forwarded to their membership.  The invitation was also posted on SSO’s social 
media pages.  Inclusion criteria for the study were current or former artistic swimmers between 
11 and 18 years old, and registered in a competitive category in Ontario.  Of 230 respondents, 
106 (46%) reported that they had sustained a concussion directly due to participation in artistic 
98 
 swimming.  Once inclusion criteria had been applied, 69 concussions reported by 50 athletes 
were eligible for analysis.  If a participant indicated that they had sustained any concussions 
during their participation in synchronized swimming, they were asked several questions about 
the circumstances surrounding their injuries.  Participants were instructed to respond to the 
questions for each concussion.  The data were exported into Microsoft Excel with any 
identifying information removed.  Descriptive statistics were calculated for all variables.  Chi 
square goodness-of-fit tests were calculated for all categorical variables.  Significance was set at 
α=.05.  Statistical analyses were conducted with IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, v.24 (IBM 
Corp, Armonk, NY). 
The mean age of athletes at the time of SRC was 13.93 (±1.97) years.  The most common 
mechanism of injury was contact with another athlete, and the most common specific activity at 
the time of injury was highlights.  Concussions most commonly occurred in the specific 
preparation and general competition seasonal phases, and during in-water training.  The deep end 
of the pool was the most commonly reported location of concussions.  Athletes diagnosed with a 
concussion were most commonly in the 13-15 Provincial competitive category, and concussed 
athletes most commonly missed more than four weeks of participation in artistic swimming.  
Chi-square goodness-of-fit tests were significant for all categorical variables. 
This preliminary work is important as it identifies and characterizes the contexts (previously 
unknown) in which concussions occur in Ontario artistic swimmers.  It lays the foundation for 
future epidemiological study of concussions in artistic swimmers, and suggests that artistic 
swimming is a contact sport. 
8.1.2 Chapter 5: Incidence of Concussion in Youth Artistic Swimmers in 
Ontario 
The purpose of the prospective study in Chapter 5 was to determine the incidence of concussions 
in youth artistic swimmers in Ontario over the 2017-2018 competitive season, and the injury 
factors associated with them.  Data were collected using an online injury surveillance system 
developed with the assistance of the PlaySafe Initiative.  Coaches were directed to fill out an 
incident report with the online tracker whenever their athletes suffered an injury that necessitated 
a disruption in artistic swimming participation.  
99 
 There were 123 injury reports filed over the 2017-2018 competitive season, 105 of which were 
filed for competitive stream athletes within the age range specified by the inclusion criteria.  
Inclusion criteria were set as follows: registered athlete with SSO, competing in national, 
provincial, or novice stream, 17 years of age or younger, and injury was sustained directly from 
participation in artistic swimming.  Any reports indicating a blow to the head or face were 
flagged as a possible concussion.  The SSO Sport Development Manager performed six week 
follow-ups with the coach filing the report for all flagged head impacts.  Concussion status was 
recorded in the report after the follow-up.   
Eight injury context variables were examined: (1) artistic swimming age at time of injury, (2) 
mechanism of injury, (3) competitive category, (4) seasonal training phase, (5) activity type, (6) 
specific activity at time of injury, (7) location and (8) concussion diagnosis. Concussion 
diagnosis was categorized into Yes (concussion) or No (musculoskeletal injury).  Concussions 
were only considered to be a “Yes” if they had been diagnosed by a medical doctor.  The injury 
risk (incidence risk) and clinical incidence of diagnosed concussions were calculated.  
Descriptive statistics were calculated for all variables. 
Of the 105 eligible injury reports, 62 (59%) were flagged as potential concussions, with 22 
(21%) diagnosed concussions and 13 incomplete follow-ups. The mean age of concussed athletes 
was 12.80 (±2.53) years, with a range of 9-17.  The majority of concussions (72.7%) and 
musculoskeletal injuries (65.7%) were reported by athletes competing in the Provincial stream.  
The most frequent mechanism of injury of concussions was contact with another athlete (72.7%).  
Concussions occurred most frequently in the specific preparation and general competition 
(36.4% each) seasonal phases.  Pattern transitions (31.8%) was the most commonly reported 
activity at the time of injury.  All but one concussion happened during training (95.5%), and the 
majority were sustained in the deep-end of the pool (90.9%).  Concussions represented 21% of 
all injury reports. 
The risk of sustaining any injury was 9.12%, and the risk of sustaining a concussion was 1.91%.  
The clinical incidence of concussion in this population was 1.91 per 100 athletes.   
 This study was significant as the first known study to measure the incidence of concussion in a 
population of artistic swimmers.  Furthermore, this study builds on the findings of the 
retrospective study in illuminating the contextual factors of concussions in these athletes.  These 
100 
 results indicate that concussions are occurring in artistic swimming at a rate similar to other 
sports, and that further monitoring of concussion incidence, as well as the factors surrounding 
these injuries, is warranted. 
8.1.3 Chapter 6: Building a Concussion Safety Program with a Provincial 
Sport Organization: A Case of Community-Based Participatory 
Research 
The purpose of Chapter 6 was to describe the design, implementation, and evaluation of the suite 
of sport-specific concussion resources developed in collaboration with Synchro Swim Ontario.  
These resources are collectively referred to as the concussion safety program.  The components 
developed were: an organizational concussion policy, concussion information document for 
athletes and parents, concussion education sessions, concussion management guidelines, a sport-
specific return to sport protocol, return to sport progress tracking tool for coaches, and an injury 
tracking program.   
The first step in the design phase was the identification of the roles of each member of the 
partnership and the scope of the project.  The next step was delineating the goals of the 
concussion safety project.  The implementation phase involved the development of document 
resources and education initiatives, and the setting up of the injury tracking research program.  
The evaluation phase consisted of defining success and identifying measures of same.  Both self-
reflection and user feedback were incorporated into the evaluation of the concussion safety 
program. 
Five main take-away messages from the partnership and collaboration experience were: (1) trust 
and respect among parties, (2) consistent communication, (3) community contribution, (4) data 
host location and (5) task burden on team members.  These lessons can be applied to continued 
collaboration between the University of Toronto research team and SSO or to other university-
community research partnerships. 
8.1.4 Chapter 7: Coach Perceptions 
The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore coaches’ perceptions of the injury tracker 
developed as part of the Ontario Artistic Swimming concussion safety program, in order to 
identify ways in which the tracker could be improved.  Three coaches were interviewed about 
101 
 their perceptions of the injury tracker and the OAS concussion resources as well as their attitudes 
towards injury reporting and injury tracking.  The interview transcripts were analyzed according 
to an inductive content analysis approach. 
Overall perceptions of the injury tracker were positive.  Awareness of the other resources was 
very limited; an important finding that indicated the need for increased communication about the 
resources to the membership.  Four main themes flowed from the data: injury reporting, 
importance of injury tracking, facilitators to using the tracker, and barriers to using the tracker.   
The participants reported being aware of instances of injuries that were not recorded in the 
tracker, but also reported viewing injury tracking as being important to them as coaches.  This 
interesting dichotomy suggests that more clarity is needed around what coaches should report 
and what a reasonable threshold for reporting chronic injuries is.  Increased communication to 
the membership around the importance of reporting chronic as well as acute injuries may also be 
warranted.  Additional recommendations for logistical improvements to the tracker that could 
enhance its use within the community were also developed from the results.   
 
 
8.2 Context 
This section will discuss the main outcomes from the research program in relation to the existing 
literature.  Specifically, the findings will be discussed in terms of the concussion incidence, 
concussion injury context, and community engaged research literatures. 
8.2.1 Concussion Incidence 
The cumulative incidence of concussion in competitive Ontario artistic swimmers during the 
2017-2018 season was 1.91%.  Cumulative incidence is the number of new cases of a condition 
(in this case concussion) that develop within the population of interest over a specific period of 
time (Bhopal, 2016).  This is a measure of the absolute risk of concussion, in other words the 
probability that an athlete would sustain a concussion over the season (Bhopal, 2016).   
102 
 Estimates of concussion in the general pediatric and adolescent population have been reported.  
Zhang, Sing, Rugg, Feeley and Senter (2016) examined the incidence of concussion in different 
age groups in the United States general population, using data from a large private health 
insurance group.  From 2007 to 2014, the incidence of concussion in the 15 to 19 age group and 
the 10 to 14 age group was the equivalent of 1.65% and 1.05%, respectively (Zhang et al., 2016).  
A Canadian estimate using data from the 1996-1997 Canadian National Population Health 
Survey found a prevalence of concussion in children ages 0-14 years of 200 per 100,000 
population (Gordon, Dooley & Wood, 2006).  A population-based study of concussion-related 
doctor visits in Ontario children aged 3-18 years reported an incidence equivalent to 0.34% in 
2003 and 0.6% in 2010 (Macpherson, Fridman, Scolnik, Corallo & Guttmann, 2014).  This 
suggests that the incidence of concussion in artistic swimming may be higher than in the general 
population, however there are limitations to the comparisons that can be drawn between these 
studies. 
Measures of cumulative incidence have also been reported in sport populations.  A study of 
children treated for gymnastics-related injuries in emergency departments in the United States 
between 1990 and 2005 reported the incidence of head and neck injuries to be the equivalent of 
0.98% in 6-11 year olds and 1.75% in 12-17 year olds (Singh, Smith, Fields & McKinzie, 2008).  
Looking at concussions in nine different youth (4-13 years) sports, Buzas, Jacobsen and Morawa 
(2014) found the incidence of concussion to be 3.85% in girls’ sports over an 11 year study 
period.  A prospective cohort study of concussions in seven US high school and collegiate sports 
reported an average single-season concussion risk for all athletes of 1.8% (Marshall, Guskiewicz, 
Shankar, McCrea & Cantu, 2015).  In a descriptive epidemiology of concussions in 13 high 
school sports in Michigan, Covassin and colleagues (2018) calculated an overall concussion 
incidence of 2.36%.  Cheerleading (male and female) had a concussion incidence of 1.73% 
(Covassin, 2018).  Among female athletes, the incidence of concussion was reported as 3.04% in 
women’s soccer, 2.92% in women’s basketball, 1.09% in women’s volleyball, 1.08% in 
women’s lacrosse and 1.07% in softball (Covassin, 2018).  Taken together, these reports seem to 
indicate that the risk of concussion in artistic swimming is on a par with the risk in other sports.  
If that is the case, there is a need to continue to measure concussions in this sport and to expand 
to include athletes from other provinces.  Injuries in artistic swimming are essentially unstudied, 
103 
 and if the risk of concussion is comparable to that of other sports, it stands to reason that it 
deserves comparable investigation. 
Nonetheless, there are some limitations to the comparisons that can be drawn between the artistic 
swimming incidence and the literature.  First, the reported incidences from other sports are taken 
from the United States, while the artistic swimming incidence is from a Canadian population.  
Most of the research from the US is reporting on student athletes from high school or middle 
school sports.  Whereas these athletes are the same age range as the ones in this study, the US 
school sports system is different from a Canadian club system.  The majority of the injuries in 
the American studies were reported by athletic trainers dedicated to each team and trained to 
recognize and treat injuries.  In the artistic swimming study the athletes’ coaches were charged 
with the responsibility of filling out the injury reports.  It’s likely that many didn’t have the same 
training in recognizing injuries nor the time to fill out the reports every single time.  In addition, 
the study population, and in turn the number of injuries, were much higher in the American 
studies.  Some of these injury surveillance studies were performed over periods of several years. 
In order to make more accurate comparisons with the literature, the artistic swimming study 
needs to be extended beyond a single season. 
8.2.2 Concussion Injury Contexts 
The most frequent mechanism of injury for concussions in the artistic swimmers in the present 
studies was contact with another athlete.  This has also been reported as the most frequent 
mechanism of injury in football, boys’ and girls’ soccer, boys’ and girls’ basketball, boys’ ice 
hockey, boys’ lacrosse, and cheerleading (Currie, Fields, Patterson, & Comstock, 2016; Marar et 
al., 2012; Marshall et al., 2015).  Traditionally, artistic swimming hasn’t been viewed as a 
contact sport.  It is important to recognize that these athletes are sustaining injuries, including 
concussions, from contact with other athletes.  Furthermore, this mechanism of injury is the same 
as other sports considered to be contact or collision sports, like football and ice hockey.  This 
parallel is important as it further supports the notion that artistic swimming should receive a 
similar level of focus and attention in terms of concussion research. 
The most frequent activity at the time of injury was highlights in the retrospective study and 
pattern transitions in the prospective study.  It was hypothesized that highlights would be the 
most frequent activity at time of injury in both studies.  However, in the prospective study 
104 
 highlights were only the third most frequently reported activity at the time of injury.  This was 
counter to expectations as stunts (the cheerleading equivalent to highlights) have been reported 
as the most frequent activity at the time of concussion injury in cheerleading (Currie et al., 2016; 
Marar et al., 2012; Schulz et al., 2004), and cheerleading and artistic swimming have many 
parallels.  Collecting more injury context data will provide a more accurate picture of the sport-
specific activities that are more likely to lead to concussion in artistic swimming.   
The most frequently reported seasonal training phases in which concussions occurred were the 
specific preparation and general competition phases, in both the retrospective and prospective 
studies.  The specific preparation phase is November to December and the general competition 
phase is January to March.  The entire season runs from September to June, meaning that the 
majority of concussions are occurring in the middle of the season.  This could be because this 
time in the season is typically when the athletes’ routines are completed and the training volume 
increases dramatically.  This increase in repetitions is occurring before the athletes have 
perfected the routine, and it is likely that mistakes are occurring that are leading to contact which 
is in turn leading to concussions.  There are limited reports from other sports of which times of 
the season concussions are more likely to happen.  A recent surveillance study of sport-related 
concussion in New Jersey high school students from multiple sports found the majority of 
concussions occurred in the fall (Shendell, Listwan, Gonzalez, & Panchella, 2018).  However, 
artistic swimming was not among the sports included in the study; therefore, comparison 
between the findings of Shendell et al. (2018) and the current study is limited. 
There are both similarities and key differences between the findings from this study on 
concussions in artistic swimmers and reported findings from other sports.  These are all 
indications that further research into concussions in this sport is warranted.  More data will assist 
in clarifying the injury contexts surrounding the concussions in these athletes, as well as help to 
calculate a more accurate estimate of the concussion incidence in this population. 
8.2.3 Community Engaged Research 
Community-engaged research (CER) is an approach that values and emphasizes the participation 
of representatives from the community in which the research is based.  Traditionally, research in 
a community setting is unidirectional, that is the academic research team performs research on 
community members without their involvement.  The researchers design the study, collect data 
105 
 from the community and decide what those data are telling them.  Sometimes the research 
findings are not readily available to the community after the research is concluded.  CER aims to 
make the research process bidirectional.  In this approach, the academic research team performs 
research with, rather than on, the community.  Representatives from the community are involved 
in various aspects of the design and implementation of projects, to mutual benefit of both the 
community and the academic researchers. 
There are several different models of CER (Ahmed & Palermo, 2010).  Participatory rapid 
appraisal, or rapid rural appraisal, uses qualitative research techniques to understand a situation, 
with three key aspects: (1) more than one researcher is involved, (2) researcher interaction is an 
important part of the methodology, and (3) results are produced much more quickly (Beebe, 
1995).  This approach enables local members to share their knowledge, and to take part in 
planning and action within their community (Chambers, 1995).  However, rapid rural appraisal is 
still largely extractive in the sense that data is collected and used based on the goals of the 
researchers (Cavestro, 2003).   
Participatory action research (PAR) is a methodology that seeks to improve health outcomes in 
participants through direct involvement and participant action.  There are three main aspects in 
which PAR diverges from traditional research techniques: (1) the focus of research is enabling 
action through self-reflection, (2) power is shared between the researchers and the researched, 
and (3) as the name suggests, PAR involves the active participation of those on which the 
research is being conducted (Baum, MacDougall & Smith, 2006).  There is an important 
distinction to be made in PAR between participation—the ownership of knowledge production 
and practical improvements—and mere involvement, which can lead to exploitation of 
participants for the benefit of others (McTaggart, 1991). 
Empowerment evaluation is a collaborative process by which a group engages in cycles of 
reflection and action for the purpose of self-determination (Fetterman, 2001), with a focus on 
program improvement through the empowerment of the people involved (Miller & Campbell, 
2006).  A guiding principle of empowerment evaluation is the honest understanding of a 
situation through a participant’s own perspective (Fetterman, 2001).   
Viewed as the most well-known of CER approaches (Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention, 2011), community-based participatory research (CBPR) is rooted in the equal 
106 
 involvement of all parties in the study of a topic that is important to the community, combining 
knowledge and action to improve community health outcomes (Minkler & Wallerstein, 2008).  
The foundation of CBPR is a repetitive process of action, reflection, and experiential learning 
(Faridi, Grunbaum, Gray, Franks & Simoes, 2007).  CBPR is often used with groups with social 
or health disadvantages, to give them a say and thereby increase the success of interventions and 
improve outcomes (Wallerstein & Duran, 2010).  The CBPR Conceptual Model was developed 
to describe the partnership dynamics, their contexts, and their effect on research and outcomes 
(Wallerstein et al., 2008).  Belone and colleagues (2016) validated and expanded the original 
CBPR Conceptual model through focus groups with six CBPR partnerships to create the Revised 
CBPR Conceptual Model.  The revised model has four dimensions: context, group dynamics, 
intervention/research, and outcomes. According to the revised model, group dynamics operate 
within contexts to produce outcomes.  An adapted version of this model can be found in Figure 5 
on page 66. 
Constructs in the revised model fit quite well with the experience of collaboration with SSO on 
the concussion safety project.  The contexts dimension describes social, historic and structural 
aspects of the partnering organizations.  Policy trends, community capacity, university capacity 
and perceived severity of health issue all played a role in this partnership.  The relatively recent 
enacting of Rowan’s Law in Ontario, which requires sport organizations to have concussion 
protocols and education for their members, was a significant impetus to SSO being on board with 
the concussion safety project.  There were some unique aspects about both the community 
organization and the university team that contributed to the success of the partnership as well.  
From SSO, RB and RK had skill sets that increased the efficiency of the design and 
implementation of some program resources.  RB’s experience in policy writing assisted greatly 
in the development of the SSO concussion policy resource.  RK’s organizational and 
communication expertise were instrumental in the implementation of various program resources.  
Finally, the perceived severity of the issue (sport concussion) was very high, lending motivation 
to both parties to complete the project.  The group dynamics dimension has three sub-categories: 
structural dynamics, individual dynamics and relational dynamics.  The length of time the parties 
were engaged in the partnership (an aspect of structural dynamics) was a factor in the success of 
the project.  The partnership first started in 2013, and has been established for several years.  
This history has provided the time necessary for trust to be built between the partners, which had 
107 
 a critical role in the success of the project.  Trust was also facilitated through the personal 
relationships between some members of the project team.  LMS and RB knew each other in a 
non-professional capacity, as LMS had coached RB’s daughter in the past.  As an artistic 
swimming coach in Ontario and the lead investigator of the university research team, LMS was 
in the unique position to act as a bridge person between the two partners.  In addition, the 
community reputation of the PI as a coach assisted in building trust and engagement in the 
project within the artistic swimming community.  The research partnership also exemplified the 
relational dynamics of participatory decision-making, self and collective reflection, flexible 
dialogue, task roles and communication, and community voice and community language.  The 
importance of using community language rather than expert language in research and 
intervention has been noted (Belone et al., 2016).   
A spectrum of community involvement in research has been described by Goodman and 
Sanders-Thompson (2017).  According to the classifications of stakeholder engagement, the 
collaboration with SSO falls under the category of “Collaboration”, which is a dimension of the 
highest category of engagement (Engaged Participation), and is marked by the active 
involvement of both partners in the design, implementation, and interpretation phases of the 
project and mutual benefit to both parties (Goodman & Sanders-Thompson, 2017).   
The research collaboration between the University of Toronto research team and SSO has been 
an excellent example of success in CBPR.  To date, the partnership has been very fruitful and has 
led to the development of 8 concussion safety program components, including member 
resources, concussion education, and injury surveillance research.  There has been mutual benefit 
to both parties and strong motivation on both sides for the partnership to continue.  Strong 
involvement in the project by the community going forward will ensure the program is sustained 
and the research aspect, the implications of which are significant for furthering the understanding 
of concussions in artistic swimming, will continue.  By incorporating the lessons learned through 
evaluation of the concussion safety program and the partnership to date, the collaboration can 
grow and continue to improve and augment the program.

 8.3 Limitations 
The research program represents a significant step forward in terms of artistic swimming 
research.  It is the first known empirical study of concussions in artistic swimmers, including the 
first known measure of the incidence of concussion in this sport and of the injury contexts 
surrounding same.  Despite the important contribution, this work has some limitations. 
Study One was a retrospective survey study.  As such, it is subject to recall bias and self-report 
bias.  In addition, the title of the data collection instrument may have introduced sample bias in 
terms of who decided to participate.  Furthermore, there was no measure of the size of the study 
population and thus no way to calculate response rate or concussion rate. 
Study Two was a prospective cohort study.  Whereas it avoided some of the biases associated 
with Study One, there was a relatively small study population which limited the measurements 
and calculations that could be performed.  Furthermore, it relied on coach observation of the 
events surrounding the injury.  There is also the chance that the incidence risk and rate estimates 
are lower than the true incidence measures, due to the possibility of under-reporting. 
Both empirical studies were limited to artistic swimmers from a single province.  This limits the 
generalizability of the results.  In addition, the injury context factors measured were chosen 
arbitrarily.  There was an effort to include a range of contextual aspects; however, an important 
one may have been missed.  The chosen factors were subject to the principal investigator’s own 
bias as well.

Conclusion 
 Conclusion  
The purpose of this program of research was two-fold.  The first purpose was to measure the 
incidence of concussions in youth artistic swimmers in Ontario, and define and describe the 
contexts within which these concussions occurred.  The second was to do so using a community-
based research approach.  The specific question that guided the research was as follows: What is 
the frequency and context of concussions among youth female synchronized swimmers in 
Ontario?  There were five associated research objectives to assist in answering the research 
question:  
a) To determine the incidence of concussion in this population in a single 
competitive season 
b) To determine the seasonal training phase in which concussions are more likely to 
occur 
c) To determine if concussions are more common in any of the competitive age 
groups 
d) To describe which injury context factors are associated with a concussion 
sustained during artistic swimming participation 
e) To develop sport-specific concussion resources for the Ontario artistic swimming 
community 
Two empirical studies, one using a retrospective and one using a prospective approach, were 
employed to address the first four objectives and are described in Chapters 4 and 5, respectively.  
The fifth objective was met through a collaboration between the university-based principal 
investigator and the community-based sport organization.  A description of the process of this 
collaboration can be found in Chapter 6, and a qualitative examination of one of the resources is 
described in Chapter 7.

 9.1 Results Summary 
Each of the research objectives were met.  Main findings are summarized below: 
a) Objective 1: The incidence risk of concussion in competitive youth artistic 
swimmers in Ontario over the 2017-2018 competitive season was 1.91%.  The 
clinical incidence was 1.91 per 100 athletes.   
b) Objective 2: Findings from both empirical studies demonstrated that concussions 
occurred most frequently in the specific preparation and general competition 
seasonal training phases.  This corresponds to the period from November through 
March.  This supports the hypothesis that more concussions would occur in the 
specific preparation phase; however, it also suggests that the period in which 
concussions are more frequent extends beyond a single training phase. 
c) Objective 3: Study One found that concussions occurred more frequently in the 
13-15 FINA competitive age group, and Study Two found concussions occurred 
more frequently in the 13-15 Provincial competitive age group.  The mean age of 
concussed athletes in Study One was 13.93 years, and in Study Two was 12.80 
years.  This suggests that around age 13 athletes may be more vulnerable to 
concussion.  This partially supports the hypothesis that more concussions would 
occur in the 13-15 age group.  Conflicting findings of concussions occurring more 
frequently in the FINA versus Provincial stream indicates more data are needed to 
fully answer this question. 
d) Objective 4: Findings from both empirical studies demonstrate that the most 
common mechanism of injury is contact with another athlete.  Concussions 
occurred much more frequently in training than in competition in both studies, 
and also occurred most frequently in the deep end of the pool.  Highlights (Study 
One) and pattern transitions (Study Two) were the most common activities at the 
time of concussion.  Similar to the hypothesis associated with Objective 3, the 
hypothesis that more concussions would be sustained during highlights and 
pattern transitions is partially supported.  Again, different findings from the 
retrospective and prospective studies indicates more data are needed to clarify 
111 
 which specific activities of artistic swimming are more frequently associated with 
concussion.  Furthermore, different research methods using an external observer 
could help to elucidate which activity is more commonly associated with 
concussions. 
e) Objective 5: A suite of seven sport-specific concussion resources was developed 
in collaboration with Synchro Swim Ontario as part of the concussion safety 
program.  The program components are: (1) an organizational concussion policy, 
(2) a concussion information document for athletes and parents, (3) concussion 
education sessions, (4) concussion management guidelines, (5) a sport-specific 
return to sport protocol, (6) a return to sport progress tracking tool for coaches, 
and (7) an injury tracking program.  All of the resources developed as part of this 
program are currently in use by Synchro Swim Ontario and its members. 
Meeting these objectives produced important information and implications for future research, 
artistic swimming officials in Ontario tasked with promoting safe sport and athlete safety, and 
medical clinicians working with artistic swimmers who may not be aware of the risk of 
concussions in the sport. 
In addition to these main findings, there were secondary findings from this research.  The 
research was conducted within the community through the formation of a collaborative 
partnership with the provincial governing body for artistic swimming in Ontario.  Study One and 
Study Two were part of the larger collaborative project, the concussion safety project, which 
developed and implemented the program of sport-specific concussion resources described above.  
This community-engaged research approach afforded the opportunity to perform studies that 
were meaningful and important to the community.  There were five main take-away lessons from 
the program development process and the partnership itself.  First, a vital part of the success of 
the partnership was the foundation of trust and respect among the partners.  Second, consistent 
communication was key to maintaining progress as well as ensuring the community felt a sense 
of contribution.  Third, the community contribution was two-fold, both through the involvement 
of SSO and through the participation of community members in the research components.  
Lastly, practical lessons in data hosting and task burden were also acknowledged.  In addition, 
community feedback from coaches assisted in the improvement of the injury tracker resource.   
112 
 These lessons may be of value to other academic-community partnerships, especially in the area 
of sport injury resources. 
 
9.2 Clinical Implications and Future Directions 
The results of this novel work can inform next steps in terms of practical applications and further 
research on this topic.  In terms of medical personnel that may be in contact with injured artistic 
swimmers, such as sport medicine specialists and athletic therapists, it is important to raise 
awareness that artistic swimming is a contact sport and there is a risk of traumatic injury, 
including concussion.  Such information could assist medical professionals in diagnosing and 
treating artistic swimmers more effectively.  The findings of this research program also have 
implications for artistic swimming organizations and officials.  For example, the findings that the 
most frequent mechanism of injury is contact with another athlete, and concussions are more 
frequent between November and March in the specific preparation and general competition 
training phases, have important implications for coach education.  It is imperative that artistic 
swimming be recognized as a contact sport, not just by those outside the sport but also by those 
involved in it.  Contact needs to be taken more seriously and strategies for introducing and 
teaching contact should be developed and provided to coaches.  Concussion risk during certain 
training phases should be included in the coach education topics of training and periodization.  
Other artistic swimming organizations (i.e., other provincial governing bodies and the national 
organization) would benefit from adopting these or developing their own sport-specific 
concussion resources.  These resources could benefit officials, coaches, and athletes alike. 
This program of research and its results are an important first step in the investigation of 
concussions in artistic swimming, and demonstrate the need for further investigation.  The 
reported incidence of concussions is the first known empirical measurement of the number of 
concussions in this sport; however, a larger data set would give a more accurate estimate.  The 
findings indicate that artistic swimmers are at a moderate risk of concussion as compared to 
other sports.  This underlines the importance of continuing to investigate concussions in artistic 
swimming.  It will be important to expand data collection to future competitive seasons and 
beyond Ontario to include athletes from other provinces, or even better the country as a whole.  
In addition, some of the findings in terms of injury factors were inconsistent between the two 
113 
 studies.  This demonstrates that further study of the injury contexts surrounding concussions in 
artistic swimming is warranted, preferably with a data collection method that is more 
independent and removed from the situation.  For example, using video analysis or a neutral 
observer could provide a higher degree of objectivity.  Having objective data will assist in the 
formulation of concussion safety guidelines and should be used as the basis for any rule changes 
or other administrative actions.  Furthermore, it will be important to continue to collect 
concussion data going forward to measure the effects of any recommendations or guidelines 
implemented by artistic swimming organizations.  It may also be valuable to examine those 
flagged head impacts that were not diagnosed as concussions, both in terms of what might be 
differentiating these situations from those that result in a concussion diagnosis, and in terms of 
the possible effects on the athletes of obtaining a diagnosis versus being left without a label for 
their injury.  Further investigation will aid in the protection of athlete health and safety, and 
assist artistic swimmers in staying involved in their sport for life.   
In conclusion, this program of research has provided several main findings related to concussion 
in artistic swimming, as well as secondary lessons in academic-community partnership.  Several 
practical resources were developed and implemented within the Ontario artistic swimming 
community.  The research program was embedded in the community through a community-
engaged research approach.  Future research would benefit from continuing this community-
based approach to promote participation and investment by the community members.  The 
findings from this research program contribute to the evolving knowledge on sport-related 
concussions by beginning to address the gaps in the literature on artistic swimming and 
concussion in female athletes.
