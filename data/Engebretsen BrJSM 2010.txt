Main Text 
INTRODUCTION 
Aquatic sports are enjoyed around the world from th e recreational level to the elite level.  FINA 
(Federation Internationale de  Natation), which was founded in 1908, was one of the original 
sports in the modern Olympic Games with th e inclusion of swimmi ng in 1896 (1). FINA has 
global representation with a to tal of 202 member National Fede rations. FINA has organized 
multidisciplinary aquatic World Championships since 1973 which are now held biannually. The 
13th FINA World Championships held in Rome in  2009 was the largest aquatic event in the 
world with 2592 athletes part icipating from 172 countries.  
Injury surveillance during elite even ts is a duty of care to ensure safety for future athletes (2, 3). 
FINA is increasingly emphasizing the protection of the health of the athlete. FINA Medical 
Rules: Preamble Item 1.0: “FINA, in accomplis hing its mission, should take care that sport is 
practised without danger to the he alth of the athletes ... To th at end, it takes the measures 
necessary to preserve the health of athletes and to minimise the risks of physical injury.” (4). 
Although the aquatic sports enjoy worldwide participation, litt le is known of the incidence of 
injury for its participants at the elite level. Injury surveillance studies  have been conducted in 
single sport events including football ( 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10), rugby (11, 12, 13, 14), handball (15), 
athletics (16), karate (17, 18, 19) , ice hockey (20, 21), volleyball (22), beach volleyball (23), 
cycling (24), and tennis (25). Injury surveillance studies have occurred in large multisport events 
at the 2004 Athens Olympic Games for team s ports and for all sports at the 2008 Beijing 
Olympic Games (26, 27). To the authors’ knowledge , no studies have been published on injuries 
incurred during major events in elite aqua tics. One prospective five-year study on NCAA 
collegiate swimmers has been published in the sc ientific literature on injury incidence (28). 
Injury prevalence in aquatic sports is publis hed from the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games (27) and 
for water polo in 2004 Athens Olympic Games (26). 
Although there are a limited numb er of publications on illness su rveillance data at elite multi-
sport events (29-31), aquatic specific illness incidence does not exist. Based on a previously 
standardized injury reporting system by the Fe deration International de Football Association 
(FIFA) in football (6-9), the IOC implemente d an injury surveillance program during the 2004 
Athens Olympic Games for team sports (26) and the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games for all sports 
(27, 32). In follow-up of the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games, the IOC decided to add illness 
surveillance for the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympi c Games. FINA conducted this current study 
to establish the feasibility of  illness surveillance component as a pilot project for the 2010 
Vancouver Winter Olympic Games. 
The objectives of the current study were to record and analyze injuries and illnesses incurred 
during the 13th FINA World Championships 2009.  
METHODS 
Implementation 
In this study, the IOC Injury Surveillance system  (32) was implemented with the extension to 
also survey illness.  All five disciplines of the 13th FINA World Championships 2009 
(swimming, water polo, diving,  synchronized swimming, open water swimming) were included 
as the study population. In preparation for the study, an information booklet was circulated one 
month in advance to the medical representative s of all participating countries. A site visit 
occurred one month prior to th e event by a member of the st udy group (MM) to educate the 
medical team of the Local Organizing Committee (LOC ) on the logistics of the study.  On-site in 
Rome, a voluntary information mee ting was held for the medical teams of the visiting countries 
two days prior to the commencement of the Ch ampionships. These information sessions included 
instructions on completion and submission of th e Reporting Forms.  Instructional booklets and 
Reporting Forms were distribu ted. The team physicians, or in their absence, a team 
physiotherapist were asked to daily report on th e occurrence (or non-occu rrence) of all newly 
incurred injuries and illnesses. Reporting Forms could be submitted at a confidential mailbox 
adjacent to swimming pools. Reporting Forms we re also accepted by fax and by electronic 
submission.  Additional reporting forms were co mpleted daily by the LOC medical team from 
each of the medical stations at the venues. Comp liance was encouraged by regular visits to the 
national federation and LOC medical staff by memb ers of the FINA Sports Medicine Committee.  
Definitions of Injury and Illness 
The definition of injury was the same definition as used in the IOC Inju ry Surveillance system 
(32), thus allowing comparison wi th previous studies (26, 27). An injury was defined as any 
musculoskeletal complaint and/or concussion newly incurred due to competition and/or training 
during the 13th FINA World Championships that received medical attention regardless of the 
consequences with respect to absence from co mpetition and/or training. Pre-existing injuries 
were not included unless there was an acute exacerbation during the time period of the Championships. Injuries occurri ng not during training or competi tion were also excluded.   
The definition of an illness was developed based on the injury definition to ensure compatibility with the existing injury protocol and ease of understanding for the participating physicians. An 
illness was defined as any physical complaint (not  related to injury) newly incurred during the 
13th FINA World Championships that  received medical attention re gardless of the consequences 
with respect to absence from competition or training. Chronic pre-existing illnesses were not 
included unless there was an exace rbation requiring medical  attention during the Championships.   
Injury and Illness Report Form 
The injury part of the report form was identical in design to the IOC Injury Surveillance System 
utilized during the 2008 Beiji ng Olympic Games (27, 32,). The following information was 
required for documentation: athlete’s accreditation number, sport/ev ent, heat/training, date and 
time of injury, injured body part/s ide, type and cause of injury, and estimated duration of the 
subsequent absence from competition and/or tr aining. The illness part of the report form was 
located directly below the injury part on the same page. The following information was required 
for documentation: athlete’s accreditation number,  sport/event, diagnosis, date, main symptoms, 
cause of illness, and estimated duration of the subsequent absence from competition and/or 
training. Definitions of injury and illness parameters were stated on the back of the form. Examples of injuries and illnesses to be incl uded on the report form were illustrated in the 
Instructional Booklet. The inju ry and illness report form wa s available in five languages 
(English, French, Spanish, Italian, and Russian). 
Confidentiality & Ethical Approval 
Completed injury and illness report forms were stored during the Champi onships in a locked 
storage cabinet. The accreditation number of the at hlete was used to ensure  that duplication of 
reporting was avoided from the team doctor a nd the LOC physicians, and to facilitate the 
determination of age and gender of the athlete from the FINA database. After the 
Championships, the forms were made anonymous to ensure that no individu al athlete or National 
Federation could be identified. Ethical approval was obtained from the Ethical Committee of the 
Oslo University School of Medicine.   
Data analysis  
All data were processed using Excel and SPSS. Response rate, coverage and incidences were 
calculated in accordance with the IOC approach fo r injury surveillance (32). Statistical methods 
applied were descriptive statistics, frequencies and cross-tabulations. For incidence rates, 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated as th e incidence 6 1.96 times the incidence divided by 
the square root of the number of injuries. 
Results   
Response rate and coverage  
A total of 2592 athletes from  173 registered countries  participated in the 13th FINA World 
Championships. The medical staff from 73 countri es (42.2%) with a total of 1745 athletes 
(67.3%) participated in  the project and returned at least one report form, resulting in a total of 
495 report forms. Since some countries did not comp ete in all five disciplines of the FINA World 
Championships, response rates were cal culated separately (see Table 1).  
The response rate and coverage of athletes by team physician’s reports were highest for water 
polo (53.4%) and lowest for swimming (21.8%).  
Table 1 
Acute injuries and illnesses were  reported daily by the physicians at the medical stations at the 
different venues. The majority of injuries ( 140; 82.5%) were reported by the team physicians; 32 
(17.5 %) injuries were reported by the LOC phys icians. Only one injury was reported by both 
sources. About three quarters of  the illnesses (n= 133, 72.3%) were reported only by the team 
physician, one quarter (n= 41, 22.3%) only from venues, and ten (5.4%) by both sources. 
Frequency and characteristics of injury 
There were 171 newly incurred acute injuries re ported during the Champions hips; equivalent to 
an injury rate of 65.6/1000 athletes. Female athlet es had a higher risk of injury (n=88; 68.4 per 
1000 athletes CI95% 54.1 – 82.7) th an male athletes (n=68; 5 2.1 per 1000 athletes CI95% 39.7 – 
64.5). The oldest injured athlet e was 37 years old, the youngest 14 (in 57 cases age was missing). 
Most injuries affected the uppe r extremity (n= 63; 36.8%), followed by the lower extremity (n= 
47; 27.5%), head/neck (n= 33; 19.3 %) and trunk (n= 28; 16.4%). The most frequently injured 
body parts were the shoulder (n=25; 14.6%), and head (n=21; 12.3%). The most common types 
of injury were sprains (n=41; 24.0%) and skin lesions (n=32; 18.7%) (see Table 2). 
Table 2 
Approximately half of the injuries (n= 79;  49.7%) were incurred during training or in 
competition (n=78; 49.1%), two injuries duri ng warm-up for competition (in 12 cases the 
information was missing). On average, 7.2 in-compe tition injuries per 1000 st arting athletes were 
reported. In most cases, the injury was caused by overuse (n=61; 37.5%). Other frequent causes 
of injury were non-contact trauma (n=25; 15. 3%) and contact with a nother athlete (n=24; 
14.7%).  
Only 21 of the reported injuries (13.4%, 14 mi ssing values) resulted in  time-loss, which is 
equivalent to an 8.1 time-loss inju ry per 1000 registered athletes or less than 1% of the registered 
athletes. The five most severe injuries (estimated absence >=14 days) were a shoulder sprain, a 
ligamentous rupture in the thoracic spine, a pa tellar subluxation, a tendon rupture in the hand and 
a broken finger.  
The general injury risk was highest for divi ng (134.1/1000 female athl etes) and lowest for 
swimming (21.8/1000 female athletes), the risk of  an in-competition injury was highest in open 
water swimming (57.7/1000 starts of  female athletes) and water polo (23.8/1000 star ts of male 
athletes). There were no time-loss injuries  incurred in women’s open water swimming and 
women’s diving.  Injuries expectin g a time-loss of greater than 14 days occurred in male water 
polo, swimming and in male open water swimming (see Table 3). While in swimming, 
synchronized swimming and diving most injuries were incurred during training, in open water 
swimming, synchronized swimming and water polo the majority of inju ries occurred during 
competitions.   
Table 3 
Frequency and characteristics of illness 
A total of 184 acute illnesses were reported, which is equivalent to 7.1% of the registered 
athletes suffering an illness duri ng the Championships. About half of the illnesses affected the 
respiratory system (n= 91; 50.3%) and a fifth th e gastro-intestinal system (n= 36; 19.9%). The 
most commonly reported symptom was pain. The most frequent diagnosis affected the upper 
respiratory tract including “otitis”  (n= 31; 16.8 %) and “tonsillitis” (n= 18; 9.8%). Consequently, 
the cause was most frequently classified as infection (n= 89; 49.2%) or environmental (n=50; 
27.6%). 
Thirty (16.3%) of the illnesses were  expected to result in time-lo ss from sport inferring that only 
1.2% of all registered athletes incurred a time-loss illness. Ho wever, time-loss illnesses were 
only reported from swimmers and male water polo players (see Table 3). No illness was 
expected to result in absence fr om sport longer than a week.  
Discussion 
The aim of this study was to register and analy ze all newly incurred injuries and illnesses in 
athletes participating in the 13th FINA World Championships 2009. To the authors’ knowledge, 
this is the first injury and illness survey during an international aquatic event. The results indicate 
that the surveillance system was feasible and a ccepted by both the team physicians and the local 
medical staff. In all disciplines (except swimmi ng) over 50% of all athletes were covered by the 
team physicians’ reports. Although medical reports were also received from LOC medical team 
at the medical stations at each  competitive and training venues, the incidence of injuries and 
illnesses may be under-estimated due to the response rate indicated above.  
On average, less than seven percent of all registered athletes incurred injuries during the 
Championships. This injury rate is consistent with the injury incidence in aquatics reported 
during the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games (4.25%) (27). The incidence of acute injury in 
swimming during the World Cham pionships was substantially lower than in a five-year 
longitudinal study in NCAA Division I Colleges in  the United States (4/1000 exposures) (28), 
which includes chronic injuries in ad dition to acute new onset injuries.  
Most injuries incurred duri ng the FINA World Aquatic Cham pionships affected the upper 
extremity followed by the lower extremity, trunk and head/neck. The most frequently injured body regions were the shoulder, lo w back and head. These findings  are consistent with other 
published data in swimming where the shoulder wa s the most affected joint. (31, 33, 34, 35, 36) 
These findings differ however from the 2008 Olympi c Games where about half of the injuries 
affected the lower extremity (27) and the 2007  IAAF World Championships where 80% of all 
injuries affected the lower extremity (16). This  discrepancy is not su rprising given the obvious 
differences in biomechanics between swimming and athletic disciplines. The injury location data 
obtained in this study illustrate the need in a quatic sport to focus injury prevention programs on 
the shoulder. 
In most cases, overuse injuries were reported as the cause of injury (37.5%). Other causes 
identified were non-contact trauma (15.3%) and c ontact with another athl ete (14.7%). All five 
time-loss injuries in water polo were caused by contact with another pl ayer, while seven time-
loss injuries in swimming were caused by overu se and the other five by non-contact trauma. 
Attention to the prevention of ove ruse injuries should be a focus of aquatic injury prevention 
programs.  
In the present study the proportion of in-competit ion injuries (50%) was lower than in team 
sports during the 2004 Olympic Games (75%) ( 26), in athletics during the 2007 IAAF World 
Championships (74%) (16) and all sports during th e 2008 Olympic Games (75%) (27). Only 21 
injuries (13.4%) reported in the present study were expected to  result in time-loss from sport. 
This proportion is substantially lower than reported from the 2008 Olympic Games (49.6% (27)), 
the 2007 Athletics World Championships (56% (16)) and the recent FIFA World CupsTM (63-
67% (8). The data from th e present study indicate that on average,  less than 1% of the registered 
athletes incurred a time-loss injury during th e FINA World Championships 2009. Even if this 
result may be an underestimation due to the mode rate response rate, these data would suggest a 
relative low risk of serious time-loss injury in aquatic sports in comparis on with other sports.  
During the FINA World Championships in Rome 2009 s lightly more illnesses than injuries were 
reported. These data contrast with the findings at the 1996 Olympic Games where more athletes 
were treated for injury (52%) th an for illness (43%) (31). The ove rall rate of illness from the 
Rome data was 7.1% of registered  athletes. Approximately half of  the illnesses reported affected 
the respiratory system. These findings are consis tent with prevalence data from other elite 
sporting events such as the Olympic Game s in 1996 (31), 2000 (29), and 2004 (30). Results 
published from a prospective analysis of upper resp iratory tract infections  (URI) in athletes 
during training and in-competition shows that URI are more common in elite athletes than in non-competitive athletes (37). This is thought to be due to the increased risk of infection from such factors as over training-induced “immuno- suppression” and from crowding at competition 
venues (38). This is supported by  the data from Rome where the highest incidence of illness was 
reported in swimming with the highest number of  competitors exposed to more crowding in 
warm-up areas and event call rooms. The most frequent diagnosis of illness was otitis (n=31). 
Beck (38) reports that ea r infections are common in aquatic s ports relating to exposure to water 
borne pathogens. No illness was expected to resu lt in absence from sport longer than one week. 
Very few illnesses were related to exercise induced causes or environmental causes. This is in 
contrast to the data reported in the literature on other elite sporting events such as marathon running (39). 
At future FINA World Championships, attention to strategies to encourage compliance with 
reporting will improve the quality of the injury and illness surveillance program. The institution of injury prevention programs based on the findi ngs from this study will be implemented and 
evaluated at future FI NA World Championships. 
 
Conclusion 
The injury and illness surveillance system was accepted by the ma jority of the medical personnel 
at the 13th FINA World Championships demonstrating its  feasibility for any large international 
multidisciplinary event. Attention to improving compliance in reporting at future FINA World 
Championships will strengthen the quality of the results. The findings are consistent with studies 
in other sports using a similar methodology. Less th an seven percent of th e registered athletes 
were injured during the Championships with most injuries caused by overuse. The most 
commonly affected body part wa s the upper extremity. The inci dence and characteristics of 
injury varied by discipline, with the lowest injury risk in swimmi ng and the highest in water polo 
and open water swimming. Approximately seven perc ent of all registered athletes suffered an 
illness during the Championships with about half affecting the respiratory system. In swimming, 
prevention studies should focus on overuse in juries with emphasis on the upper extremity. 
Medical care at future FINA Wo rld Championships should institu te measures to decrease the 
incidence of respiratory illnesses.
