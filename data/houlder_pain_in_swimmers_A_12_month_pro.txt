Objective: To investigate shoulder pain incidence rates and selected risk factors for shoulder pain in
competitive swimmers.
Design: 12-month prospective cohort study.
Setting: Five swimming clubs in Melbourne, Australia.
Participants: 74 (37 M, 37 F) competitive swimmers ranging in age from 11 to 27 years and performing at
leastﬁve swim sessions per week.
Assessment of risk factors: Swimmers completed a baseline questionnaire regarding demographics,
anthropometric features, swimming characteristics and training and injury history. Active shoulder
internal (IR) and external rotation (ER) range of motion and passive joint laxity were measured.
Main outcome measurements: Shoulder pain was self-reported over 12 months with signi ﬁcant inter-
fering shoulder pain (SIP) de ﬁned as pain interfering (causing cessation or modi ﬁcation) with training or
competition, or progression in training. A signi ﬁcant shoulder injury (SSI) was any SIP episode lasting for
at least 2 weeks.
Results: 28/74 (38%) participants reported SIP while 17/74 (23%) reported SSI. Exposure-adjusted inci-
dence rates were 0.3 injuries and 0.2 injuries per 1000 swim km for SIP and SSI, respectively. Swimmers
with both high and low ER range were at 8.1 (1.5, 42.0) and 12.5 (2.5, 62.4) times greater risk of
sustaining a subsequent SIP, respectively and 35.4 (2.8, 441.4) and 32.5 (2.7, 389.6) times greater risk of
sustaining a SSI, respectively than those with mid-range ER. Similarly swimmers with a history of
shoulder pain were 4.1 (95% CI: 1.3, 13.3) and 11.3 (95% CI: 2.6, 48. 4) times more likely to sustain a SIP
and SSI, respectively.
Conclusion: Shoulder pain is common in competitive swimmers. Preventative programs should be
particularly directed at those swimmers identi ﬁed as being at risk of shoulder pain.

1. Introduction
Shoulder pain/injury is the most common musculoskeletal
problem experienced by competitive swimmers ( McMaster, 1999;
Mountjoy et al., 2010; Weldon & Richardson, 2001 ). Of the rela-
tively few studies investigating shoulder injury incidence in this
sporting population, reported rates vary widely depending on the
speciﬁc injury de ﬁnition employed ( Chalmers & Morrison, 2003 ).Given its prevalence, numerous risk factors for shoulder injury in
swimmers are proposed in the literature including glenohumeral
joint range of motion and laxity, scapular dyskinesis, rotator cuff
strength imbalances, gender, competitive swimming level, stroke,
swim distance and hand paddle usage during swim training ( Bak,
2010; Blanch, 2004; McMaster, Roberts, & Stoddard, 1998;
McMaster & Troup, 1993; Richardson, Jobe, & Collins, 1980; Sein
et al., 2010; Weldon & Richardson, 2001; Wolf, Ebinger, Lawler, &
Britton, 2009 ). However, these have received limited prospective
investigation ( Gaunt & Mafulli, 2011 ).
Biomechanical three dimensional analysis of freestyle swim-
ming supports the notion that adequate rotational shoulder range
of motion is required to swim with correct technique and avoid
shoulder impingement ( Yanai & Hay, 2000; Yanai, Hay, & Miller,*Corresponding author. Tel.: þ61 3 8344 4135; fax: þ61 3 8344 4188.

2000 ). However, cross-sectional studies investigating associations
between shoulder injury in swimmers and shoulder internal (IR)
and external (ER) rotation range of motion and glenohumeral joint
laxity report mixed ﬁndings ( Allegrucci, Whitney, & Irrgang, 1994;
Bak & Magnusson, 1997; Beach, Whitney, & Dickoff-Hoffman, 1992;
McMaster et al., 1998; Ozcaldiran, 2002; Rupp, Berninger, & Hopf,
1995; Sein et al., 2010; Zemek & Magee, 1996 ). Inferences regarding
the role of joint laxity and range of motion in the aetiology of
shoulder injury are dif ﬁcult to draw from these studies as it is
unclear whether de ﬁcits are pre-existing or sequelae of injury.
This study sought to (i) investigate shoulder injury incidence
and exposure-adjusted injury rates and (ii) identify the predictive
value of several risk factors for these injuries, with a particular
focus on shoulder IR and ER range of motion and glenohumeral
joint laxity, in competitive swimmers.
2. Methods
2.1. Setting and study design
A prospective cohort study was conducted involving competi-
tive swimmers in Melbourne, Australia.
2.2. Participants
A sample of convenience was recruited. Swimmers from ﬁve
competitive swimming clubs in Melbourne, Australia who
competed at state, national or international level, performed at
leastﬁve swim sessions per week and intended to continue this
training level during the following 12 months were eligible to
participate in this study. Swimmers were excluded if they had
a history of shoulder surgery or dislocation, were suffering shoulder
pain on the day of testing or had any other injury that would
interfere with the test procedures. The study was approved by the
institutional Human Research Ethics Committee and all partici-
pants or their parents/guardians provided written informed
consent.
2.3. Procedures
Swimmers completed a baseline questionnaire regarding
demographics, anthropometric features, swimming characteristics
and training and injury history. Shoulder range of motion and laxity
testing was conducted in a standardised order by the same sports
physiotherapist (HW). Active shoulder IR and ER range of motion at
90/C14abduction was measured with a Dualer Inclinometer (J-Tech
Medical, Salt Lake City) in supine with manual scapular stabilisa-
tion ( Boon & Smith, 2000 ). Anterior-to-posterior glenohumeral
translation was measured in prone at 90/C14shoulder abduction using
a modiﬁed KT1000 arthrometer (MED-metric Corporation, San
Diego) ( Pizzari, Kolt, & Remedios, 1999 ). Glenohumeral joint
translation in millimetres was recorded at 89 N of applied force as
this was an appropriate pre-set level on the device for shoulder
testing.
In a separate study, the intra-examiner reliability (ICC 2,3) stan-
dard error of measurement (SEM) and minimal detectable change at
the 90% con ﬁdence level (MDC 90¼1.65*SEM*O2) of shoulder range of
motion ( n¼17) and laxity testing ( n¼14) was examined in
a subgroup of competitive swimmers ranging in age from 12 to 24
years ( Table 1 )(Haley & Fragala-Pinkham, 2006; Portney & Watkins,
2009 ). The results indicate good to excellent reliability for all
measures with SEM of 2/C14or less and MDC 90of 5/C14or less.
The potential risk factors studied are detailed in Table 2 .
Swimmers were instructed regarding the shoulder injury de ﬁ-
nition and underwent 12 months injury surveillance followingbaseline measurement. Swimmers were asked to complete, and
submit, a weekly diary to report shoulder injury status. When diary
forms were not submitted, swimmers were contacted directly each
fortnight via SMS (short message service for mobile phones),
telephone or email to ascertain shoulder injury status. Episodes of
shoulder pain meeting the injury de ﬁnition were self-reported
using standardised injury report and severity forms. Injury
severity was indicated by symptom duration (weeks) and the
number of modi ﬁed or missed training sessions. In most instances,
injury report and severity forms were collected within two to four
weeks of occurrence. Swim coaches supplied copies of swim
training records from which weekly exposure in kilometres and the
number of sessions completed were derived.
The shoulder injury de ﬁnition used was based on previous
research and de ﬁned a priori as signi ﬁcant interfering shoulder
pain (SIP) that interfered with training or competition, or
progression in training and caused cessation or modi ﬁcation of
training or racing ( McMaster et al., 1998; McMaster & Troup, 1993 ).
In addition, a signi ﬁcant shoulder injury (SSI) was de ﬁned as any
SIP episode lasting for at least two weeks. The use of two injury
outcomes in this study allowed for the investigation of potential
risk factors for both short- and longer-duration injury episodes.
2.4. Data analysis
Data were analysed using SPSS 11.0 for Windows. Range of
motion and laxity data were categorised according to tertiles (low,
middle, high) to examine potential non-linear relationships with
shoulder injury, with the middle category the reference for anal-
yses. Each variable was examined for side and gender differences
and the signi ﬁcant differences for shoulder IR and laxity betweenTable 1

males and females were accounted for by gender-speci ﬁc catego-
risations for these tests.
Preliminary bivariate logistic regression analyses identi ﬁed
those variables associated with SSI or SIP, and variables with p
values<0.15 were retained for the multivariate analyses. The
independent predictors of shoulder injury (SSI and SIP) were
determined using backward stepwise binary logistic regression.
The goodness of ﬁt (Hosmer and Lemeshow test), adjusted odds
ratios and 95% con ﬁdence intervals (CI) were calculated from the
ﬁnal logistic regression model.
3. Results
3.1. Cohort characteristics and shoulder injury incidence rates
Seventyﬁve swimmers were recruited. One participant with-
drew and was excluded from the analysis. As such, the study cohort
comprised 37 female and 37 male swimmers ranging in age from 11
to 27 years. Nine swimmers ceased swimming and one moved
interstate, nonetheless their data were retained as analyses
included adjustment for swim training exposure. Table 3 detail
swimmers ’training, shoulder range of motion, laxity and demo-
graphic characteristics.
Compliance with completing the injury diary was low with only
12 swimmers submitting the diary for the 12 months. However,
injury surveillance via fortnightly direct contact through SMS,email or telephone was very successful. Hence the overall injury
surveillance rate was 87%. Swim squad averages were used to
calculate individual training exposure data for 63 (85%) partici-
pants. Individual training mileage and attendance information was
only available for 11 (15%) participants. Training data were
unavailable for 122 (14%) of the 888 potential injury surveillance
months. The average of each swimmer ’s available monthly swim
kilometres was substituted for missing training data where
required ( Engels & Diehr, 2003; Tabachnick & Fidel, 1989 ). Overall,
19,043 swim training sessions and 91,838 km of swimming were
calculated for the cohort during the surveillance period.
During the 12-month study, 28/74 (38%) participants reported
SIP while 17/74 (23%) reported SSI. The exposure-adjusted inci-
dence rates were 0.3 injuries per 1000 swim kilometres for SIP and
0.2 injuries per 1000 swim kilometres for SSI. More than one
shoulder injury episode was reported by nine (32%) swimmers. The
majority of SSI (74%) and SIP episodes (68%) reported were new
injuries. Most injuries (90%) were sustained during swim training,
speciﬁcally during the main set (74%) whilst performing the
propulsive pull through phase of the freestyle stroke. Only ﬁve
percent of injuries were reported during competition or after swim
training. The duration of the worst shoulder injury episode was
4/C62 weeks for both SSI and SIP. The number of modi ﬁed or missed
swim sessions for the worst injury episode was 15 /C621 for SIP and
22/C624 for SSI. The mean /C6SD age of injured swimmers was 15 /C63
years with shoulder injuries evenly distributed by side and gender.
3.2. Independent predictors of shoulder injury
Preliminary bivariate analyses results were the same whether
adjusted or unadjusted for swim training kilometres. There was
a signiﬁcant association between a positive 12-month shoulder
pain history and both injury outcomes (SIP: p¼0.045; SSI:
p¼0.006), whereas ER range was signi ﬁcantly associated with SIP
(p¼0.015) and met the multivariate model inclusion criteria
(p<0.15) for SSI ( p¼0.07). These two variables were retained for
the multivariate analysis to identify independent predictors of
shoulder injury ( Table 4 ). None of the other examined variables was
associated with shoulder injury.
The signi ﬁcant independent predictors of shoulder injury,
adjusted for swim training exposure, were ER range of motion (SIP:
p¼0.008, SSI: p¼0.02) and previous shoulder injury history (SIP:
p¼0.02; SSI: p¼0.001). The adjusted odds ratios indicated that
swimmers in both the low and high ER range of motion groups
were at elevated risk of developing a shoulder injury than those in
the mid-range group. Similarly swimmers with a history of
shoulder pain were 4.1 (95% CI: 1.3, 13.3) and 11.3 (95% CI: 2.6, 48. 4)
times more likely to sustain a subsequent shoulder injury for SIP
and SSI respectively. Swim training distance was not a signi ﬁcant
predictor of shoulder injury (SIP: p¼0.07; SSI: p¼0.1). Both ER
(SIP: p¼0.008, SSI: p¼0.02) and previous shoulder history (SIP:
p¼0.02; SSI: p¼0.001) were signi ﬁcant predictors when analyses
were not adjusted for swim training exposure (km).
4. Discussion
This study utilised a prospective cohort design to investigate
shoulder injury incidence and selected risk factors for shoulder
injury in Australian competitive swimmers. Our ﬁndings of
shoulder injury incidence rates ranging from 23% to 38% con ﬁrm
the notion that shoulder injuries in competitive swimming are
common ( Mountjoy et al., 2010; Richardson et al., 1980 ). Prior
retrospective surveys report SIP incidence rates of 29% e49% over
a 12 month period ( Burchﬁeld, Coﬁeld, & Co ﬁeld, 1994; Hall,
Stewart, & Rogers, 1995 ) and 62% over a swim career ( McMasterTable 3

& Troup, 1993 ). Prevalence rates reported for SIP range from 20% to
38% ( Capaci, Ozcaldiran, & Durmaz, 2002 ;McMaster & Troup,1993 ).
Surveys using injury de ﬁnitions other than SIP report shoulder
injury incidence of 42% e62% ( Stocker, Pink, & Jobe, 1995 ). Our
ﬁndings are most consistent with previously reported SIP preva-
lence rates, highlighting the need for consistency of injury de ﬁni-
tion to allow for valid comparison between studies ( Brooks & Fuller,
2006 ).
In our study, shoulder injury rates ranged from 0.2 to 0.3 injuries
per 1000 km of swimming depending on the de ﬁnition used. The
incidence of all swimming injuries has been reported as 0.9 injuries
per 1000 swim hours ( Bak, Bue, & Olsson, 1989 ), 3.78 to 4 injuries
per exposures ( Wolf et al., 2009 ) and 21.8 injuries per 1000 female
swimmers ( Mountjoy et al., 2010 ). In practical terms, a squad of 20
swimmers that trains 50 km each week may sustain ﬁve SIP and
three SSI events during a 16-week training phase. Thus shoulder
injuries are a liability for swimming programs and attention to
preventative strategies are needed ( McMaster, 1999; Mountjoy
et al., 2010 ).
Recurrence of shoulder injuries in swimming is frequent ( Bak
et al., 1989 ). This study con ﬁrms the signi ﬁcant independent
association between a positive past history of shoulder injury and
subsequent shoulder injury risk, concurring with research from
other sports ( Emery, 2003 ). The reason for this relationship is
unclear but may relate to pre-existing risk factors or insuf ﬁcient
rehabilitation of shoulder injuries. While history of shoulder injury
is a non-modi ﬁable risk factor, it can be used as a marker to identify
swimmers at risk of injury in whom preventative efforts should be
particularly directed.
Measurement of shoulder rotational range of motion and laxity
in an abducted position is a recommended component of clinical
examination for overhand athletes ( Blanch, 2004; McQuade &
Murthi, 2004; Reinhold & Gill, 2009 ), despite the controversy in
the literature regarding the underlying mechanisms for alterations
in shoulder joint motion or laxity, particularly the respective roles
of capsular tightness, muscle stiffness and humeral torsion ( Huxel
et al., 2008; McQuade & Murthi, 2004; Torres & Gomes, 2009;
Whiteley, Ginn, Nicholson, & Adams, 2009 ).
In this study, swimmers with high ( /C21100/C14) or low (<93/C14)
shoulder ER range of motion were at increased risk of developing
a shoulder injury than those with mid-range motion, irrespective of
whether the results were adjusted for swim training exposure. This
supports the hypothesis that there is an ideal range of ﬂexibility
needed to swim without developing a shoulder injury ( Blanch,2004 ). Previous cross-sectional studies investigating the relation-
ship between rotational range of motion and shoulder pain in
swimmers are con ﬂicting with results showing either no signi ﬁcant
correlation between either IR and ER and SIP ( Bak & Fauno, 1997;
Beach et al., 1992 ) or signiﬁcantly greater total rotational range of
motion in swimmers with shoulder pain, compared with controls
(Ozcaldiran, 2002 ). Another report demonstrated a trend towards
reduced IR in swimmers with shoulder injuries ( Bak & Magnusson,
1997 ). Differences in cohort characteristics, injury de ﬁnitions and
study design most likely explain the disparate results.
Despite the statistically signi ﬁcantﬁndings for ER as a risk factor
for shoulder injury in this study the application of these ﬁndings to
the clinical setting requires consideration. The intra-tester reli-
ability of range of motion measurement was good to excellent (ICC:
0.90e0.96) with SEM and MDC 90for all rotation tests of 2 and 5/C14,
respectively. The minimal detectable change of ER testing was
smaller than the range of scores delineating mid-range ER (7/C14),
low-range (21/C14) and high-range (14/C14) indicating that, in this
research context, the range of scores was detectable by the
measurement method employed ( Haley & Fragala-Pinkham, 2006;
Kolber, Vega, Widmayer, & Cheng, 2011; Portney & Watkins, 2009 ).
Biomechanical analyses of freestyle swimming have indicated
that shoulder impingement may occur when swimmers exceed
their available shoulder range of motion during the freestyle stroke,
dependent on the swim technique employed ( Yanai & Hay, 2000;
Yanai et al., 2000 ). Swimmers impinge their shoulders most
frequently during the recovery phase of the freestyle stroke ( Yanai
& Hay, 2000 ) wherein the shoulder abducts and externally rotates,
passing through the clinically de ﬁned ‘painful arc ’of impingement
(Neer, 1983 ). Cadaveric studies suggest that suf ﬁcient ER is required
to prevent internal impingement of the humeral head with the
superior glenoid during abduction ( Edelson & Teitz, 2000 ) and
limited ER range of motion has been associated with the develop-
ment of subacromial impingement syndrome ( Kim & McFarland,
2004; Lin, Lim, & Yang, 2006; Michener, McClure, & Karduna,
2003 ). There is suf ﬁcient evidence from animal and human
studies that overuse loading of the shoulder, during the swimming
stroke action, precipitates rotator cuff tendon thickening and ten-
dinopathy ( Bey, Song, Wehrli, & Soslowsky, 2002; Carpenter,
Flanagan, Thomopoulos, Yian, & Soslowsky, 1998; Lee, Nakajima,
Luo, Zobitz, Chang, & An, 2000; Mihata, Lee, McGarry, Abe, & Lee,

may affect the potential for extrinsic tendon impingement in
swimmers ’shoulders ( Sein et al., 2010 ). It is possible that swim-
mers with limited ER who performed their stroke at the end of their
available range were at increased risk of impingement during arm
recovery, particularly in the presence of overuse-related tendon
thickening.
Swimmers in this study with greater ER motion ( /C21100/C14) were
also at increased risk of sustaining a shoulder injury. It is possible
that the high ER range of motion observed in some swimmers
reﬂects detrimental changes to the shoulder passive restraints
and, potentially, its neuromuscular control. In healthy individuals,
less subscapularis activity is observed in response to ER pertur-
bations with the shoulder in maximal ER compared with neutral
ER, whilst joint stiffness remains unchanged for both positions,
indicating that structures other than the rotator cuff are providing
stability ( Huxel et al., 2008 ). Application of a non-destructive ER
stretching protocol to cadaveric inferior glenohumeral ligaments
results in signi ﬁcant increases in ligament length ( Pollock et al.,
2000 ) and ER range ( Mihata et al., 2004 ) as well as subtle
increases in anterior translation ( Mihata et al., 2004 ). In vivo, such
repetitive microtrauma to the shoulder stabilising structures may
result in subtle anterior shoulder instability, secondary impinge-
ment of the rotator cuff and biceps tendons ( Belling Sorensen &
Jorgensen, 2000 ), as well as altered glenohumeral kinematics
(Huffman, Tibone, McGarry, Phipps, Lee, & Lee, 2006 ). Increased ER
range is also associated with reduced kinaesthetic sense in the
dominant shoulders of overhead athletes, attributable to micro-
traumatic damage to the shoulder joint capsule and receptors
(Allegrucci, Whitney, Lephart, Irrgang, & Fu, 1995 ) and this altered
proprioceptive input may affect the stabilising function of
the shoulder musculature ( Nyland, Caborn, & Johnson, 1998 ).
Certainly, altered neuromuscular control has been identi ﬁed as an
important factor in the aetiology of secondary impingement in
swimmers ( Blanch, 2004 ). A further consideration is that twisting
and lengthening of the anterior portion of the supraspinatus
tendon has been observed in cadavers during ER ( Nakajima,
Hughes, & An, 2004 ). These authors suggest that axial rotation
may impair tendon perfusion under tension, thereby providing
a rationale for studies citing external rotation as a risk factor for
rotator cuff injury ( Nakajima et al., 2004 ). Theoretically, swimmers
with increased ER range may be susceptible to greater intrinsic
tendon injury.
Loss of IR range of motion due to tightness of the posterior
capsule is frequently cited as a risk factor for shoulder injury in
overhead athletes ( Levine, Brandon, Stein, Gardner, Bigliani, &
Ahmad, 2006; Myers, Laudner, Pasquale, Bradley, & Lephart,
2006; Warner, Micheli, Arslanian, Kennedy, & Kennedy, 1990 ),
however there was no association between IR range and swimming
shoulder injuries in this study. Most likely, insuf ﬁcient less eccen-
tric loading of the rotator cuff and posterior capsule occurs during
swimming than in other overhead sports such as throwing or
tennis, to cause the loss of IR associated with injury. Alternatively,
IR may not be useful for injury prediction given that it can vary
considerably diurnally in swimmers ( Blanch, 2004 ) and in an
associated study on the current cohort, right sided internal rotation
was the least stable variable in non-injured swimmers over a six
month period.
There was no association between joint laxity measured at
baseline and subsequent shoulder injury. These ﬁndings are in
contrast to previous reports whereby shoulder hyperlaxity was
reported to be a factor in the aetiology of shoulder injury in
competitive swimmers ( Bak, 2010; Bak & Fauno, 1997; McMaster
et al., 1998; Zemek & Magee, 1996 ). A signi ﬁcant correlation
between current interfering shoulder pain and joint laxity was
reported in competitive swimmers where glenohumeral laxity wasassessed using clinical laxity tests and apprehension ratings
(McMaster et al., 1998 ). However, the use of subjective apprehen-
sion rating in a composite score for joint translation has been
questioned ( Blanch, 2004 ) and there is debate surrounding the
reliability of clinical laxity testing at the shoulder ( Bahk, Keyurapan,
Tasaki, Sauers, & McFarland, 2007; Levy, Lintner, Kenter, & Speer,
1999 ). Furthermore, there is debate in the literature as to
whether joint laxity or muscle stiffness is being tested ( Huxel et al.,
2008; McQuade & Murthi, 2004 ). One study reported a signi ﬁcant
difference in quantitatively measured shoulder joint translation
between swimmers and controls, however the applied forces were
not standardised ( Tibone, Lee, Csintalan, Dettling, & McMahon,
2002 ). Conversely, another study reported no difference in trans-
lation between swimmers and controls or with respect to shoulder
pain history when tested at a higher level of force, 150 N ( Borsa,
Scibek, Jacobson, & Meister, 2005 ). An important consideration is
the direction of shoulder laxity testing utilised in the current study,
being anterior-to-posterior translation. Laxity testing in other
directions or more extreme ranges of shoulder ER may yield
different results and further research is warranted. Nevertheless,
theﬁnding of this study that shoulder laxity was not associated
with shoulder injury is not surprising given that considerable
shoulder capsule laxity may be present without symptomatic
shoulder instability ( McFarland, Garzon-Muvdi, Jia, Desai, &
Petersen, 2010; McFarland, Kim, Park, Neira, & Gutierrez, 2003;
Richards, 2003 ).
Exposure to repetitive overhead arm motion during training is
cited as a contributing factor in the development of shoulder pain
in competitive swimmers ( Ciullo & Stevens, 1989; Sein et al., 2010;
Weldon & Richardson, 2001 ), however, this study did not
demonstrate an association between shoulder injury and training
mileage. In contrast, a prior cross-sectional study reported that
swimmers completing >35 km per week of swim training were
four times more likely to have supraspinatus tendinopathy ( Sein
et al., 2010 ). In this study, a considerable portion of swim
training exposure data (85%) was derived from squad averages,
which limits its usefulness given that swim coaches ’reports of
mileage have low validity compared with direct observation of
training by researchers ( Stewart & Hopkins, 2000 ). A limitation of
many longitudinal studies is participant drop out and missing data
(Twisk & de Vente, 2002 ). Training data were missing for 14% of the
injury surveillance period and was imputed by averaging the
available training data of these participants. This method is
deemed to be one of the best methods for treatment of missing
data in a longitudinal study ( Engels & Diehr, 2003 ). Furthermore,
similar results were obtained when the results were not adjusted
for swim training kilometres. Another consideration is that
training exposure was examined as a continuous variable in the
current study, precluding identi ﬁcation of a non-linear relation-
ship with shoulder injury. Given these limitations, the role of
overuse loading in the aetiology of swimming-related shoulder
pain should not be discounted.
There are a number of considerations when interpreting our
results. In comparison with prospective research in other sports
a small cohort was investigated ( Emery, 2003 ). Swimmers with
a previous shoulder injury are more likely to volunteer, increasing
the likelihood of overestimation of injury incidence and risk factor
association. Injuries were self-reported, hence, individual differ-
ences in pain tolerance and recall may have impacted reporting
(Hanita, 2000 ). Furthermore not all injuries may have been re-
ported. Swimmers did not undergo diagnostic examination and it is
possible that some injuries were attributable to structures other
than the shoulder. Finally, the contribution to the understanding of
the aetiology of shoulder injury in swimming is limited to the
speciﬁc risk factors investigated.H. Walker et al. / Physical Therapy in Sport 13 (2012) 243 e249 247
5. Conclusions
The incidence of shoulder pain reported in this study for
Australian competitive swimmers is comparable to published
injury rates and provides a benchmark for the future evaluation of
preventive programs. Of the examined potential risk factors, only
previous history of shoulder pain, and high or low shoulder ER
range of motion were signi ﬁcantly associated with shoulder injury.
Theseﬁndings can be applied practically to identify swimmers who
may be at increased risk of developing shoulder pain and who may
beneﬁt from prevention strategies.
