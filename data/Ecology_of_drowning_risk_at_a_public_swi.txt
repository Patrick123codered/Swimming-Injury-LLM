Abstract
Introduction: The fourth-leading cause of death in middle childhood is drowning, but there is remarkably little known about swimmer or
lifeguard behavior patterns at public swimming pools. Method: This study used non-intrusive obserxvational methodology to examine risk-
taking by swimming patrons (predominantly children) and surveillance habits of lifeguards at a public swimming pool. The study also
examined whether risk-taking behavior might be associated with density of swimmers, temperature, or lifeguard behaviors. Results: Results
suggested risk-taking behavior was common, with dangerous incidents observed over 90 times per hour. Particularly high were rates of
running on the deck, which exceeded 100 incidents per hour near the deepest water of the pool, and jumping into the water dangerously close
to other swimmers, which was witnessed about once every two minutes in the shallow water of the pool. Lifeguards tended to scan the pool
well, and remain attentive to the areas under their responsibility, but they were distracted about 10 times per hour and warned patrons only
about once for every 14 dangerous incidents observed. Conclusions: No consistent correlates to risk-taking behavior by swimming pool
patrons were identified. Results are discussed with respect to previous findings and implications for intervention. Impact on Industry: Findings
emphasize the need to increase awareness and adherence to safety rules by swimmers at swimming pools; to educate and remind lifeguards a bout
proper swimming pool surveillance techniques; and to consider environmen tal changes at public swimming pools t hat might increase swimmer safety.

1. Introduction
Among the more popular summer recreational activities
for children in the United States and much of the world isswimming. In general, swimming offers healthy and
enjoyable exercise, but it also includes risk for drowning
injury. In fact, among American children in middle
childhood (ages 5 –11), drowning is the fourth leading
cause of death overall (following motor-vehicle crashes,
malignant neoplasms, and congenital anomalies). Among
children of all ages, drowning is the second-leading cause of
unintentional injury death in the United States ( National
Center for Injury Prevention and Control [NCIPC], 2006 ).
Despite the public health burden of drowning incidents,
remarkably little is known about the process of drowning —
especially in public swimming pools, where drownings are
rare but highly visible and emotionally disturbing events.
This study was developed to study the patterns of risk and
prevention at a public swimming pool. Non-intrusive obser-
vational methodology was used to measure two critical
behavior patterns: risk-taking by swimming patrons and
surveillance habits of the lifeguards.Journal of Safety Research 38 (2007) 367 –372

The study had three primary objectives. First, we sought to
quantify the risk-taking behavior swimming pool patrons –
who were predominantly children –engaged in during their
time at the pool. Second, we sought to quantify the surveillance
behavior of lifeguards, to identify the extent to which they are
distracted, the frequency of scanning the areas within their
responsibility, and the extent to which they issue warnings to
pool patrons. Third, we examined factors that might be related
to risky behaviors at a pool. Is there more risk-taking during
days when the pool is crowded? On hot days? When lifeguards
are distracted? Each of the three objectives was accomplished
through non-intrusive observational study of daily behavior at
the pool.
2. Methods
2.1. Setting and Sample
The study took place at an outdoor public swimming pool
located in a Jewish Community Center (JCC) in Birming-
ham, Alabama. The pool was open to the public but required
a membership for entry; the patrons were disproportionately
(about 50%) Jewish and almost all (about 95%) Caucasian.
The pool was physically designed in a “U”-shape and cov-
ered approximately 6,000 square feet. Between two and five
lifeguards monitored the pool simultaneously from three
tower-chairs and various deck stations, depending on the
number of swimmers and various other factors.
Observational data collection was timed to coincide with
the busiest times at the pool, when children attending summer
camps used the pool along with the public. On average, there
were 60.81 people in the pool during observations ( SD=
16.44; 92% of those individuals were children) and 20.97
more people on the pool's deck ( SD=10.05; 60% children).
Fourteen lifeguards worked at the swimming pool on a
rotating basis. During observational times, there were typ-
ically about five lifeguards on duty, serving in a rotational
pattern with three or four actively watching the pool and the
remainder taking a break. The lifeguards were a mean of
20.50 years old ( SD=3.65, range=16 to 30), had a mean of
5.11 years of lifeguarding experience ( SD=3.59, range=2 to
15), and included eight women and six men. All but one
were Caucasian.
2.2. Protocol
As part of a larger intervention study ( Schwebel, Lindsay, &
Simpson, in press ), observational data were collected at the
swimming pool four days per week, matching the busiest
times in the pool. Data collection was cancelled when the
pool was closed due to inclement weather. This report con-
siders only pre-intervention data, and therefore represents
typical behavior at the pool, prior to contamination from the
intervention.
In total, 20 days of pre-intervention observation were
available, which is equivalent to roughly 70 hours of pool-observation, over 4,200 hours of individual swimmer ob-
servation, over 1,500 hours of individual observation of
patrons on the deck, and about 300 hours of individual
lifeguard observation.
For ethical reasons, lifeguards were informed at the start
of the season that they might be observed by behavioral
researchers, but were unaware of when observations were
scheduled or occurring. Swimmers were unaware of the
ongoing research program. Researchers completing the
coding were young, dressed in swimming attire, and at-
tempted to “blend in ”to the crowd at the pool. No empirical
data on the success of blending were recorded; anecdotally, it
appeared that lifeguards were occasionally aware of the
active observations but usually not; swimmers appeared not
to be aware of the ongoing research.
2.3. Coding Patterns
Two coders independently collected data. One coder
rotated through three clearly defined sections of the pool,
recording patron risk-taking in three-minute segments, and
then began coding each lifeguard present for three minutes
each in a counter-clockwise manner around the pool. At the
end of those rotations, the number of children and adults in
the pool and on the deck were recorded, and then the cycle
began anew. The second coder followed the same pattern,
but began with lifeguards and then switched to the sections
of the pool, creating a situation whereby the coders rarely
overlapped in their observations. Rotation times were indi-
cated by a vibrating wristwatch, and coding was postponed
for 10 minutes every hour, coinciding with lifeguard breaks
(during those 10 minutes, only individuals over age 18 were
permitted to swim); weather conditions were recorded during
those break times.
The three non-overlapping sections of the pool were as
follows: the shallow area, which was where most young
children swam and played, and which progressed from 3 to
3.5 feet deep; the “middle depth ”area, which progressed
f r o ma b o u t3f e e t ,4i n c h e st o4f e e t ,2i n c h e sd e e pa n dw a s
an area where many older children swam, played games,
and threw balls; and the deep area, which was 12.5 feet
deep, and included three diving boards. Observation of each
area encompassed the water as well as the surrounding deck
areas.
Inter-coder reliability was established during the first
week of the study, during which observations were
conducted simultaneously but independently. Reliability
was excellent (all rsN.80, and 8 out of 9 rsN.90 for con-
tinuous measures; kappa=1.00 for the single categorical
measure).
2.4. Measures
While observing risky patron behavior in the three areas
of the pool, coders tallied incidents of five types of dan-
gerous behaviors: (a) pushing people under the water ,368 D.C. Schwebel et al. / Journal of Safety Research 38 (2007) 367 –372
defined as one individual pushing another under water in an
angry, aggressive, or malicious manner; (b) dangerous
diving , defined as diving head-first into a shallow area of
the pool; (c) aggressive acts , defined as behavior including
hitting another person with hands or toys, throwing objects
angrily at other people, or pushing people; (d) jumping into
the water near someone else , defined as jumping into the
water within an arms' reach of another person; and (e) run-
ning on the deck , defined as having both feet off of the
ground simultaneously while running to jump into the water,
get to the diving board, or get elsewhere. These behaviors
were chosen because they are among the primary riskbehaviors addressed in lifeguard training manuals (e.g.,
American National Red Cross, 2001 ), although there is no
empirical research definitively linking the behaviors to
drowning incidents.
Lifeguard observations occurred in a rotating counter-
clockwise pattern, and included observation of all lifeguards
on duty at that time. Four behaviors were coded: (a) looking
at the pool , which was scored at a single moment, imme-
diately after the wristwatch vibrated, as a binary measure —
whether the lifeguard was looking toward his or her ap-
pointed area or was distracted and looking elsewhere;
(b)distractions , defined as intervals when the lifeguards'Table 1

attention was distracted away from the target area for
5 seconds or more (e.g., talking to a patron or other lifeguard,
eating or drinking, applying sunscreen, etc.); (c) warnings ,
defined as verbal or whistled warnings delivered to a patron
or patrons in an attempt to curtail dangerous or risky be-
havior; and (d) scans , defined based on Harrell's (1999)
criteria as the movement of the lifeguards' gaze from one
section of the pool to another, and evidenced by the shifting
of the head. These behaviors were chosen because they have
been linked to risk of patron drowning in previous empirical
research ( Branche & Stewart, 2001; Study Shows Life-
guards, 2002 ).
3. Results
Descriptive data concerning risky patron behaviors were
examined first (see Table 1 ). Included in the descriptive analysis
was a repeated measures ANOVA comparing measures in the
shallow, middle, and deep depth areas of the pool.
On average, there were almost 60 children in the pool at
once. The children spent time in all parts of the pool, but
were concentrated most in the shallow end. There were very
few adults (on average, 4.38) in the pool during observa-
tions. Since lifeguards are charged with protecting the safety
of individuals on the pool deck as well as people in the pool,
we also counted patrons on the deck; there was an average of
23.48 people on the deck during our observations.
Dangerous patron behaviors were surprisingly common.
In fact, we observed patrons running on the deck more than
once per minute, we witnessed dangerous jumps near other
swimmers about once every three minutes, and we saw
patrons pushing others under water and acting in aggressive
manners a few times per hour each. A composite measure of
all dangerous behaviors summed yielded a total of 91.37
dangerous behaviors per hour. The dangerous behaviors
occurred in all parts of the pool, but were most common in
the deep end (especially running on the deck) and shallow
end (especially running on the deck and jumping into the
water too close to other swimmers).
Table 1 also shows descriptive data concerning the
lifeguards. The lifeguards warned swimmers about danger-
ous behavior, on average, 12.77 times per hour. Stated
differently, the lifeguards issued a warning roughly once for
every 14 dangerous behaviors we witnessed. As to the
lifeguards' tendency toward distraction, they were generally
looking at their appointed area, but we did catch almost 10
distractions per hour, suggesting attention was not optimal.
Scanning behavior was strong, with lifeguards scanning their
eyes over 360 times per hour (roughly once every
10 seconds). Lifeguard measures were not available for
specific areas of the pool because the areas of the pool that
particular lifeguards were responsible for changed regularly,
depending on the number of lifeguards on duty. Lifeguard
domains of responsibility also overlapped with each other (as
recommended by the American Red Cross), and therefore
could not be measured independently.Our third research objective was to assess whether risky
patron behavior at a swimming pool might be related to
lifeguard behavior, the number of people present, or the
weather. Table 2 illustrates a correlation matrix between all
measures of the full swimming pool. Several expected
relations emerged. For example, there were more people in
the pool on hotter days. Most of the correlations, however,
were not significant. The number of children in the pool was
not associated with changes in risky patron behavior, and
was only moderately associated with decreased distraction
and increased warnings by lifeguards. The number of people
on the deck was associated with increased patron running
and with more lifeguard warnings, perhaps because people
on the deck were running more often. Lifeguard warnings
were associated with more frequent dangerous jumps into the

pool, but not to other risky behaviors. Temperature was
unrelated to any behavioral measures.
We also examined correlations between measures within
parts of the pool (see Table 3 ). As shown, the results
corresponded to data from the entire pool reasonably well.
In the shallow end, more dangerous jumping was witnessed
when more children were present —not surprising since a
greater density of people would create fewer safe jumping
areas. In the middle depths, more aggression was witnessed
when more children were present; again, this may be the
result of increased density in that area. In the deep end of
the pool, there was more running observed with hotter
temperatures.
4. Discussion
This study had three primary objectives. First, we sought
to understand the extent of risk-taking that takes place
in public swimming pools. Results revealed substantial
amounts of risk-taking. In particular, the extent of running on
the deck (which exceeded 100 incidents per hour in the deep
end of the pool) and jumping into the water dangerously
close to others (about once every two minutes in the shallow
part of the pool) were alarmingly high. The composite mea-
sure suggested a pool average of dangerous incidents occur-
ring over 90 times per hour. Further, the highest rate of risk-
taking (almost 120 incidents/hour) was in the deeper end of
the pool, where there were the fewest patrons swimming.
The shallow end of the pool, which was the most crowded,
had a rate of risky behavior around 100 incidents/hour and
the middle depths the lowest rate (56 incidents/hour).
The second objective of the study was to quantify life-
guard behaviors. Here, we discovered some encouraging
news. Lifeguards tended to be looking at their appointed
areas and demonstrated frequent scanning behavior. In fact,
the average scanning rate among our lifeguards was nearly
10 times that reported previously ( Harrell, 1999 ). We did
note about 10 incidents of lifeguard distraction per hour,
however, which is contrary to lifeguard training guidelines
from the American National Red Cross (2001) and a topic
that should be addressed in intervention research. Lifeguards
issued almost 13 warnings per hour to swimming pool pa-
trons, many more than we anticipated based on previous
research ( Harrell, 2001 ), but still disproportionate to the
number of dangerous incidents witnessed.
The study's third objective was to explore whether
number of people in the pool, lifeguard behaviors, or tem-
perature might be related to risk-taking by swimming pool
patrons. Among the more consistent findings were relations
between number of children in particular parts of the pool
and dangerous behaviors there —when density of swimmers
increased, dangerous behaviors also increased. There was a
scattering of significant cor relations between lifeguard
behaviors and risky swimming, but no consistent pattern of
relation emerged. We also did not discover any consistent
relations between temperature and risk-taking.In general, our findings did not correspond well to those
reported previously by Harrell (1999, 2001, 2003) . This was
particularly true of lifeguard scanning. Harrell reported
negative correlations between scanning and number of
swimmers ( Harrell, 1999 ) and between duration of looking
at the pool and number of children swimming ( Harrell,
2003 ); we failed to replicate these relations. There are a few
possible explanations for the discordance in the research
findings. Our pool was over twice the size of the average
pool in Harrell's (1999) research, was located outside, and
included more children and many fewer adults swimming.
The populations were also different (indoor pools in Calgary
vs. outdoor pool in Birmingham).
4.1. Implications for Prevention
Drowning remains a serious threat to children, even in
public swimming areas that are lifeguarded ( Branche &
Stewart, 2001 ). The results of this study suggest that patron
risk-taking is alarmingly high at public swimming pools.
Although lifeguard behaviors we witnessed were reasonably
encouraging, there is still much room for improvement to
prevent drowning incidents. Intervention efforts should
target at least three domains: swimmers, lifeguards, and
swimming environments.
Results from this study suggest many swimmers are either
unaware or neglectful of pool rules. Training on safe swim-
ming habits should be a priority for lifeguards, especially
when dealing with young children who may not have the
capacity to learn and remember rules easily ( Morrongiello,
Midgett, & Shields, 2001 ) and with excited, impulsive, or
active children who may neglect rules that they understand
(Schwebel & Barton, 2006 ). Lifeguards should be encouraged
to rotate frequently to reduce the tendency toward distraction.
Pool administrators should offer frequent reminders to life-
guards about the importance of properly scanning the pool
and reducing distraction tendencies ( Schwebel et al., in press ).
Also important, based on the present results, is the need for
lifeguards to warn patrons about dangerous activities. The
present data suggest lifeguards only intervene for 1 out of 14
dangerous behaviors that occur.
Finally, environmental changes at swimming pools might
improve safety. Harrell (1999) found the lifeguards scanned
better while sitting in towers than while standing on the deck.
Ropes dividing shallow and deep water areas are recom-
mended (e.g., Association of Pool and Spa Professionals,
2005 ). Emergency lifesaving supplies should be readily
accessible, and frequent breaks offered to both swimmers
and lifeguards.
4.2. Limitations and Conclusions
This study represents an initial glimpse at behavior pat-
terns by swimmers and lifeguards at a public swimming
pool. Despite the study's strengths –rich observational data
collected over substantial periods of time in a poorly371 D.C. Schwebel et al. / Journal of Safety Research 38 (2007) 367 –372
understood domain of knowledge –it also suffered from a
few limitations. First, only observational data were available.
Basic descriptive data of the swimmers are unavailable and,
perhaps more important, we do not have detailed behavioral
data, an understanding of motivations for lifeguard or patron
behavior, or a full analysis of potential correlates to the
behaviors studied.
Second, we measured behaviors believed to be associated
with drowning risk rather than actual drownings and near-
drownings. Although public swimming pool drownings are a
significant public health burden when considered broadly,
drownings are rare events at individual pools. Most swim-
ming pools have no drownings over the course of several
summer seasons, and we witnessed no drownings or near-
drownings during our observations. The patron behaviors we
studied were selected because they are the behaviors targeted
by most lifeguards, but there is only anecdotal evidence that
they are directly related to injury or drowning incidents. If
there is a link, the probability that any single instance of
dangerous behavior would lead to an injury or a drowning
incident is quite low.
Unlike the patron behaviors we recorded, lifeguard
surveillance behaviors are linked to drowning risk in a few
small-scale empirical studies ( Branche & Stewart, 2001;
Study Shows Lifeguards, 2002 ), but that link remains poorly
understood. Future research is needed to consider both
swimmer and lifeguard behaviors that serve as precursors to
actual drowning or near-drowning incidents, perhaps via
round-the-clock videotaping of pool activity in several
swimming areas.
A third limitation of this study is the poor statistical power
available for inferential analyses. The correlation matrices
presented in this article are valuable, but must be interpreted
cautiously. Multiple tests were conducted, and Type I error
inflated. Power to detect a large effect size in a correlation
with N=20 is only .69; power to detect small and medium
effect sizes is even poorer.
In conclusion, this study presents heretofore uncollected
data on the ecology of patron and lifeguard behavior at a
public swimming pool. Drowning represents the second-
leading cause of unintentional injury death during middle
childhood, and the development of intervention techniques
must be educated by an understanding of behavioral risks
such as those reported.
